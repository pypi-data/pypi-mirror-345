{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and status as working. It has a drop position at (4.5, -58.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore, which is currently full.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of multiple chests storing iron plates:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) each containing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) containing a large number of iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore and Plate Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-4.5, -52.5) and (-5.5, -52.5) containing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-2.5, -52.5) containing iron ore.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing both iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Stone Furnace Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) with various statuses indicating fuel and ingredient issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from a full chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before attempting to extract items. Consider transferring or using the contents to free up space.\n\n### Errors due to furnace fuel and ingredient issues\n- Regularly check and refuel furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel. Ensure that there are sufficient ingredients available for smelting processes.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `burner_mining_drill`: Represents the mining drill entity with its position, fuel, and status.\n- `wooden_chest`: Represents the storage chests with their positions and inventory contents.\n- `iron_chest`: Represents the iron chests with their positions and inventory contents.\n- `stone_furnace`: Represents the furnaces with their positions, fuel status, and inventory contents."}
