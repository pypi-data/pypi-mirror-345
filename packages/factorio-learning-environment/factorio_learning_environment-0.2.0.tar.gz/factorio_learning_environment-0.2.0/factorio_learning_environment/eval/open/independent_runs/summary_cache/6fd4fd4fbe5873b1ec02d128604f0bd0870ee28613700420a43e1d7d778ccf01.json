{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5), currently working with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, y=-60.5), (4.5, y=-58.5), and others, used for storing mined resources. The chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0) and (-13.0, y=-48.0), both currently working and processing iron ore into iron plates. A third furnace at (-11.0, y=-48.0) is not operational due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, y=-50.5) to (-6.5, y=-50.5), some of which are full with iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-6.5, y=-50.5) and (-5.5, y=-50.5), used for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly supply furnaces with necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production and avoid idle time.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_chest_position`: Position of the chest storing iron ore, type: `Position`\n- `furnace_positions`: Positions of the furnaces, type: `List[Position]`\n- `iron_plate_chests`: Positions of the chests storing iron plates, type: `List[Position]`\n- `mining_drill_position`: Position of the burner mining drill, type: `Position`\n\nThis report provides a concise summary of the current structures and errors observed in the recent steps, along with namespace details for better code management."}
