{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining operation at position(x=43.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position(x=43.0, y=-82.0), a Furnace at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0), and several Chests at positions(x=42.5, y=-83.5), (x=44.5, y=-81.5), (x=45.5, y=-80.5), and (x=43.5, y=-79.5). The Burner Mining Drill is used for mining coal, and the Furnace is used for smelting. The Chests are used for storing coal and other items.\n\n### Coal transportation system at position(x=43.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of a Burner Inserter at position(x=43.5, y=-80.5) that transports coal from the Chest at position(x=44.5, y=-81.5) to the Chest at position(x=43.5, y=-79.5).\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when mining coal\n- Ensure that the Chest at the drop position is not full before mining coal.\n- Refuel the Burner Mining Drill when it runs out of fuel.\n### Errors when smelting items\n- Ensure that the Furnace has ingredients to smelt before attempting to smelt.\n- Ensure that there is iron ore in the inventory before attempting to smelt iron plates.\n### Errors when using the Burner Inserter\n- Ensure that the Burner Inserter has a source of items to pick up before attempting to use it.\n- Ensure that the drop position of the Burner Inserter is not occupied by another entity."}
