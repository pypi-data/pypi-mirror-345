{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automated Coal Mining System (around position x=38, y=-83)\nSelf-sustaining coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=38.0, y=-83.0) facing RIGHT\n- Transport belt line running from y=-83 to y=-87\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - Fuel inserter (position x=38.5, y=-84.5) for recycling coal to drill\n  - Output inserter (position x=38.5, y=-86.5) for collection\n- Output wooden chest (position x=39.5, y=-87.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility (around position x=45-47, y=-80)\nComplex consisting of:\n- Two stone furnaces (positions x=45.0, y=-80.0 and x=47.0, y=-80.0)\n- Multiple wooden chests for input/output:\n  - Output chests (positions x=45.5, y=-82.5 and x=47.5, y=-82.5)\n  - Storage chests (positions x=45.5, y=-77.5 and x=47.5, y=-77.5)\n  - Additional storage (position x=49.5, y=-79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Multiple burner inserters:\n  - Two at y=-81.5 for output handling\n  - Two at y=-78.5 for input handling\n- Transport belt system (from x=52.5 to x=56.5 at y=-81.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Belt Placement and Orientation Issues\n- Ensure belt orientations are properly aligned before placement\n- Verify belt connections form a continuous flow\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to fix or replace them\n\n2. Entity Space Management\n- Check if destination has space before attempting transfers\n- Clear blocked positions before placing new entities\n- Ensure proper spacing between connected components\n\n3. System Design\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner entities\n- Ensure proper input/output connections between components\n- Verify chest capacity before continuing production\n\nNAMESPACE\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the game world\n  Success: When placement position is clear and valid\n  Failure: When missing required parameters or position is blocked\n\nImportant Variables:\n- EntityStatus: Enum tracking entity states (WORKING, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, etc.)\n- Direction: Enum for entity orientations (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- Position: Type for coordinate tracking (x, y)\n- Inventory: Type for storing item quantities"}
