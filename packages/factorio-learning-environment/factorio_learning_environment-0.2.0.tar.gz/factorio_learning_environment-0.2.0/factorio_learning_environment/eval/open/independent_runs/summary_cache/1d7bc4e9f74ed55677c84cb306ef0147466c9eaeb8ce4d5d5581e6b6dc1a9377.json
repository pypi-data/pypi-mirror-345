Always verify that the target entity is compatible (for example, use an inserter that feeds items into the engine) rather than a steam engine itself.\n\u2013 Placement failed in one instance because the target position (3.5, 15.5) was too distant (15.89 units away versus a maximum of 10). Ensure that you move close enough to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\u2013 In another case, placement of a wooden chest failed due to the item not being available in inventory. Always check that the required item is present before initiating a placement.\n\u2013 A NameError occurred because \u201ctarget_chest\u201d was not defined. Confirm that all target entity variables are properly declared and assigned with the intended values before use."}
