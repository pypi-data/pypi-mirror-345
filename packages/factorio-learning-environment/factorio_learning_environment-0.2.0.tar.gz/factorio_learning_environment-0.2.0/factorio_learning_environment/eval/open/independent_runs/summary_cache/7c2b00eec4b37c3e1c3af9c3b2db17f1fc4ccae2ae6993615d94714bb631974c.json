{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Pipe Network at Position (-8.0, 24.5) to (-5.0, 24.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Pipes placed at positions (-8.0, 24.5), (-7.0, 24.5), (-6.0, 24.5), and (-5.0, 24.5)\n- Underground pipe entrance at position (-8.0, 24.5) and exit at position (-6.0, 24.5)\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5), (8.5, 1.5), (17.5, 1.5), and (19.5, 1.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at position (35.5, 27.5)\n- Small electric poles connected to the steam engine\n\n### Furnace Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), and (19.5, 0.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces\n\n### Lab\n- Lab at position (8.5, 0.5) not connected to power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions or incompatible terrain when placing pipes. Clear any obstructions before placing.\n- Verify that you have sufficient pipe inventory before attempting to place pipes.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Steam Engine\n- Ensure that all necessary connections are made between the boiler and the steam engine. Check for missing pipes or incorrect connections.\n- Make sure the steam engine is properly connected to the power network.\n\n### Errors in Placing Underground Pipes\n- Ensure that the entrance and exit of underground pipes are correctly aligned and that there are no obstructions in the path.\n\n### Errors in Lab Placement and Connection\n- Verify the presence of a lab in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n- Ensure the lab is connected to a power source to function correctly.\n\n### Errors in Extracting and Inserting Items\n- Make sure the target entity for extraction or insertion contains the required items or has available space.\n- Move closer to the target entity when extracting or inserting items to ensure successful interaction.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Always verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you are trying to place."}
