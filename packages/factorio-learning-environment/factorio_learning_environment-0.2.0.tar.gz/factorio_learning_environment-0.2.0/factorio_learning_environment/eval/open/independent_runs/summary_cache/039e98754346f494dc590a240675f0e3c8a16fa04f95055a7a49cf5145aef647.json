Multiple repositioning attempts (using alternative directions and nearest-buildable area) were made to place the engine successfully.\n- Boiler at position(-6.0, 24.5) which, after insertion of coal, now shows status FULL_OUTPUT with no warnings.\n- Offshore Pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) operating in WORKING status.\n- Pipeline Network comprising several connection attempts (direct connection, segmented piping via a calculated midpoint, and search for an existing steam-carrying pipe group) that have not yielded a valid fluid connection between the boiler and steam engine.\n- Manual Fuel Feeding System: Wooden chest at position(-4.5, 25.5) designated for fuel storage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n- Pipeline Connection and Fluid Transfer:\n  \u2022 Before connecting, verify that both source and target connection points are clear, within range, and compatible for fluid transfer.\n  \u2022 For segmented pipeline attempts, ensure that intermediate connections are unobstructed and that the fluids present match the target\u2019s requirements.\n  \u2022 When direct connections fail, recheck alignment and environmental clearance at both the boiler and steam engine connection points.\n  \n- Entity Placement and Collision Avoidance:\n  \u2022 Prior to repositioning large entities such as the steam engine, validate that the target tile is free of obstructions (e.g. existing pipes or water areas). Adjust spacing or change the placement direction if collisions occur.\n  \n- Buildable Area Calculation:\n  \u2022 When determining a placement position using buildable areas, access attributes (like using the 'center' property) correctly instead of calling non-callable objects. This avoids type errors such as the \u201c'Position' object is not callable\u201d issue.\n  \n- Pipe Group Identification:\n  \u2022 When attempting to attach an entity to a pipe network, ensure that a pipe group carrying the required fluid (steam) exists near the chosen reference position. Use accurate reference coordinates and verify existence before repositioning.\n  \n- General Connection Strategies:\n  \u2022 Always re-evaluate connection attempts if initial methods (direct or segmented) fail. Consider both environmental obstructions and inventory limitations (e.g. insufficient pipes) as potential causes."}
