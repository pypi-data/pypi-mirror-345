{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), refueled with coal\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions including (x=1.5, y=21.5) to (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes. Check the path between the starting and ending positions for any obstructions.\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Verify that there is a suitable position for placing small electric poles. Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions in the intended placement area.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(Position, Position, Set[Prototype])`: Attempts to connect entities using pipes. Failure occurs due to placement blockages.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: Represents the connection of pipes between positions."}
