{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n  - Status: No Fuel\n  - Furnace Inventory: Contains 10 units of copper ore\n  - Fuel: Empty\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0)\n  - Status: No Fuel\n  - Furnace Inventory: Empty\n  - Fuel: Empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having it in the inventory will result in an error.\n- Verify that the target location is suitable for placing an entity. Avoid attempting to place entities where there are existing objects in the way.\n\n### Errors related to crafting and inventory management\n- Ensure you have sufficient resources in your inventory before crafting. For instance, attempting to craft a Stone Furnace without enough stone will cause an error.\n- Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid assertion errors related to insufficient resources, such as iron ore.\n- Ensure you have all necessary ingredients before attempting to craft complex items. For example, crafting a Burner Mining Drill requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and a stone furnace.\n- Before crafting an Inserter, ensure you have iron plates, iron gear wheels, and electronic circuits available in your inventory.\n- Avoid referencing undefined variables in your code. For instance, ensure that 'crafted_inserters' is defined before using it in a condition.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Confirm that the entity contains the items you wish to extract. Attempting to extract iron plates from a stone furnace that does not contain them will result in an error.\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has completed the smelting process before attempting to extract iron plates. Repeated attempts to extract iron plates prematurely will result in errors.\n- Attempting to extract copper plates from a stone furnace without copper plates will result in an error. Ensure the furnace has processed copper ore into copper plates before extraction.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient fuel\n- Always ensure that the stone furnace is adequately fueled before initiating the smelting process. Lack of fuel will prevent the furnace from operating and producing the desired output.\n- Make sure to have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. Attempting to insert coal without having it will result in an error.\n\n### Errors related to premature extraction attempts\n- Avoid attempting to extract items from the stone furnace before the smelting process is complete. Ensure the furnace has processed the iron ore into iron plates before extraction attempts."}
