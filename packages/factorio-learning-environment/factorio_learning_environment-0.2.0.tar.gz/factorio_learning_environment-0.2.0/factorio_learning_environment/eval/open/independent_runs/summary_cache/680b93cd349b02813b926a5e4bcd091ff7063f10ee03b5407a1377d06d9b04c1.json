{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore (output blocked)\n- **Burner inserter** at (17.5, 72.5) moving ore to belts (output blocked)\n- **Transport belts** connecting drill to inserter and furnace (blocked at 15.5,72.5)\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 74.0) for smelting iron ore (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-47.5, 74.5) for storage\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) extracting copper ore (output blocked)\n- **Burner inserter** at (-48.5, 72.5) moving ore to belts (waiting for source items)\n- **Transport belts** connecting drill to inserter and furnace\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 74.0) for smelting copper ore (out of fuel)\n\n#### Power Generation Setup at (-21.5, 70.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-21.5, 70.5) supplying water (working)\n- **Boiler** at (-25.0, 80.5) converting water to steam (fueled)\n- **Steam engine** at (-25.5, 89.5) for power generation (connected and working)\n- **Pipe network** connecting these components (fluid system 381 for water, 384 for steam)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Distance-Related Errors\n- Move within 10 tiles of target before placing entities (repeated attempts at 60+ tile distances)\n- When working with distant setups, teleport or walk closer before attempting modifications\n\n#### Placement and Connection Errors\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- Clear existing entities before placing new ones (attempted to place on occupied belt at 15.5,72.5)\n- Adjust spacing/direction when placement fails due to collisions (failed inserter placement near furnace)\n\n#### Inventory and Throughput Issues\n- Clear blocked transport belts to allow inserter operation (multiple blocked outputs reported)\n- Monitor belt inventories to prevent congestion (iron belt at 15.5,72.5 has 46 iron ore backed up)\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and input materials (multiple furnaces reported out of fuel)\n\n#### Entity Interaction Errors\n- Verify entity exists before attempting interaction (failed to get wooden chest at -47.5,72.5)\n- Check inventory capacity before inserting items (failed to insert coal into full inserter)\n\n#### Power System Optimization\n- Maintain fuel supply to boilers and furnaces\n- Monitor power network connections to ensure full coverage\n- Address warnings about blocked outputs promptly"}
