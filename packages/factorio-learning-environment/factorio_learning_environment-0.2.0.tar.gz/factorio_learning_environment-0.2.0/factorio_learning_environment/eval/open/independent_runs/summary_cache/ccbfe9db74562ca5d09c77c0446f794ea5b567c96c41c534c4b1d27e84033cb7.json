{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, -62.0)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -67.5, -98.5), boiler (position 0.5, -62.0), and steam engine (not explicitly mentioned in the latest logs but inferred from the previous report).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(4.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 4.0, -62.0) and a furnace at position (4.0, -62.0)\n\n### Lab at position(0, 0)\nConsists of lab (position 0, 0) which is currently not powered.\n\n### Electricity poles\nConsists of the following poles:\n- Small electric pole at positions (0.5, -21.5), (0.5, -17.5), (0.5, -13.5), (2.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 2.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. In this case, a small electric pole could not be placed at (2.5, 2.5) because another entity already exists there.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all power-consuming entities, such as labs and boilers, are connected to a power source to avoid them being non-functional."}
