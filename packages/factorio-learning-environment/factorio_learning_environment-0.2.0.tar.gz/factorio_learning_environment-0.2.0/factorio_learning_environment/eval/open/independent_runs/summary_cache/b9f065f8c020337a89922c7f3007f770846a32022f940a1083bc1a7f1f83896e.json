{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Basic Smelting Setup\nLocated at positions:\n- Wooden Chest at Position(x=1.5, y=0.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=3.0, y=1.0)\n\nThis setup currently consists of a wooden chest and a stone furnace. The wooden chest can be used to store items, while the stone furnace is used for smelting ores into plates. The furnace has been fueled with coal and has produced iron plates, but it currently has no ingredients to smelt, as indicated by its status.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place entities like Wooden Chests and Stone Furnaces failed due to occupied positions.\n\n### Incorrect use of API for entity interaction\n- When inserting items into an entity, ensure the second argument is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position object. This mistake was made while attempting to insert items into the furnace.\n\n### Type errors in code\n- When using the `int()` function, ensure the argument is a string, bytes-like object, or real number. Avoid using objects like `ModelPrivateAttr` as arguments.\n\n### Undefined variables in code\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. An error occurred when attempting to connect a mining drill to a chest due to an undefined variable `mining_drill`.\n\n### Errors in crafting and building setup\n- Review the crafting and building setup to ensure all necessary components and connections are correctly defined and implemented."}
