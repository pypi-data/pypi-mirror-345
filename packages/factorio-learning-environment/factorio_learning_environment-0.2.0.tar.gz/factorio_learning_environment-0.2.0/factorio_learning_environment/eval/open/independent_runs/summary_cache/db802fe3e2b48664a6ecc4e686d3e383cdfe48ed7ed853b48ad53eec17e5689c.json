Always verify the active fluid system identifier from the current pipeline network before initiating a connection.\n\n\u2022 Inflexible Pipeline Stabilization Waiting:\n  - Relying on fixed waiting periods (10 seconds) does not guarantee pipeline readiness. Replace static delays with dynamic connectivity checks to ensure the pipeline is properly stabilized prior to connection attempts."}
