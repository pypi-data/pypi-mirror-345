{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-44.5, -123.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-45.5, -124.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -123.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-44.5, -119.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Inserter and Chest Group\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located at an unspecified position\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 10.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-5.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Networks\nConsists of multiple ElectricityGroups:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (2.5, -63.5), (1.5, -61.5), (7.5, -62.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (20.5, -44.5), (7.5, -43.5), (22.5, -42.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the boiler. The boiler is not receiving water, which indicates a connection issue. Verify the alignment and connectivity of pipes between these entities.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- The steam engine is not connected to the power network. Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the electricity network to distribute generated power.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- The inserter is not receiving electricity. Check the connectivity of the inserter to the power network and ensure that it is within range of an active electric pole.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Input Liquid\n- The boiler is not receiving input liquid. Double-check the connections from the offshore pump to the boiler to ensure there are no gaps or misalignments in the piping system."}
