{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground, no sink entity to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory contains 24 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities is not occupied by another entity. This includes checking for space around chests and furnaces before attempting to place inserters or other entities.\n- Verify that there is enough space for the entity you are trying to place, especially when placing next to other entities like chests or furnaces.\n\n### Errors with connecting entities\n- When attempting to connect belts, ensure that you are using the correct intermediary entities like inserters to connect from a chest. Belts cannot be directly connected from a Prototype.WoodenChest object.\n\n### Errors when extracting resources\n- Before attempting to extract resources, ensure that there is a valid entity containing the desired resource at the specified location. This includes verifying the presence of resources like iron ore at the extraction site.\n\n### Errors with inventory management\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities. For example, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into a mining drill.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status and warnings of your entities to ensure they are functioning correctly and address any issues that may arise, such as blocked outputs or lack of ingredients."}
