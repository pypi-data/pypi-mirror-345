{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=40.5, y=-80.5) and (x=42.5, y=-80.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-45.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-49.5) and (x=-9.5, y=-49.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from chests\n- Ensure that the target chest contains the items you intend to extract. Verify the chest's inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when transferring items to furnaces\n- Confirm that the furnace is ready to accept items and that there is space in the furnace's input inventory before transferring items.\n\n### Errors when moving items from mining drill drop positions\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full and is correctly positioned to receive items from the mining drill.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status and inventory of entities to prevent operation halts due to full inventories or lack of materials.\n- Maintain a clear and organized layout to facilitate easy access and management of resources and structures."}
