Remove any existing entities if necessary.\n\n### Errors when Connecting to Power Network\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network.\n\n### Errors when Refueling Entities\n- Ensure that the second argument when refueling is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Check that the target position for placing an entity is unoccupied. Remove any existing entities at that position before placing a new one.\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory to craft the desired items before attempting to craft."}
