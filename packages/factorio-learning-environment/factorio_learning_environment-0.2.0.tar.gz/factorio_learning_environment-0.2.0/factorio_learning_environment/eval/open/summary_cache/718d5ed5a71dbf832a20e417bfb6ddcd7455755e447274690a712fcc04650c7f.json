{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates\n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) providing electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by an electric pole.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel insertion and fuel shortages\n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into burner mining drills, furnaces, and burner inserters failed due to \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n- Ensure sufficient coal is harvested and present in the player inventory before attempting to fuel burner entities.\n- Avoid attempting to insert fuel when inventory is empty; add checks to confirm inventory contents before insertion.\n- Fuel shortages cause burner mining drills, furnaces, and burner inserters to stop working, halting production.\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power despite connections\n- Assembling machine 2 remains without power even after connecting to electric poles.\n- Verify that electric poles are correctly placed and connected within the power network.\n- Check that poles cover the assembling machine and all inserters requiring electricity.\n- Confirm that poles themselves have power and that the power network is energized.\n\n### Errors inserting items into inserters repeatedly without inventory items\n- Repeated exceptions when inserting coal into burner inserters indicate attempts to insert items not present in inventory.\n- Implement inventory checks before insertion calls to prevent exceptions.\n- Avoid redundant insertion attempts when inserters are already fueled or when inventory is empty.\n\n### General placement and connection tips (from previous report)\n- Confirm target tiles are free before placing entities to avoid collisions.\n- Use inserters to extract items from furnaces before feeding belts; direct belt connections from furnaces are invalid.\n- Ensure correct assembling machine type is available in inventory before placement.\n- Regularly verify power network connectivity and energy levels of electric entities.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
