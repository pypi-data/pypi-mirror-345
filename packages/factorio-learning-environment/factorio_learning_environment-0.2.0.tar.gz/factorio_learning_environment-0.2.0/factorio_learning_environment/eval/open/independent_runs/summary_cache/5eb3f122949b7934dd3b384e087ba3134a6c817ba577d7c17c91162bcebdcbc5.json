{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, although currently not receiving ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates potential alignment issues.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the burner inserter and mining drill to maintain continuous operation. Ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory for refueling.\n\n### Errors in Resource Availability\n- Verify that the necessary resources are available in the inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before attempting to refuel or insert into mining drills.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is correctly set up to receive iron ore from the inserter. Check the inserter's drop position and the furnace's input slot to confirm proper alignment and functionality."}
