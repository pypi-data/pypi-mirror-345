{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Ensure inserters are correctly aligned to transfer materials between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials.\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to maintain continuous operation. Inserters without fuel will not function.\n\n### Errors with Iron Ore Supply to Furnace\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly positioned and operational to supply iron ore to the furnace. The furnace will not smelt without the necessary ingredients.\n- Ensure the chest is not full to allow continuous mining. Empty the chest regularly to prevent mining stoppages.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Extract items from the chest to free up space."}
