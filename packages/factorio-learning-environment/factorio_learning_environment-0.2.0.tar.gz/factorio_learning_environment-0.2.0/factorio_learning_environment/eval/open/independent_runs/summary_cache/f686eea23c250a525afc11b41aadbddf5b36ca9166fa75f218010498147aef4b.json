{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for the extraction and processing of iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Operations\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all necessary entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly check fuel levels to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Not Producing Iron Plates\n- Verify that the stone furnace has both iron ore and sufficient fuel to process the ore into iron plates. Regularly check the furnace's inventory to ensure it has the necessary ingredients.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Monitor the inventory of the wooden chest to prevent overflow. If the chest becomes full, it will halt the mining operation. Regularly extract items from the chest to maintain space for new resources.\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities effectively. Misalignment can cause a disruption in the production line.\n\n### Warnings in Entity Status\n- Pay attention to warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" or \"chest at drop position is full.\" These indicate issues that need to be addressed to maintain efficient operations."}
