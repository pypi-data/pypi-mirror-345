Gather or produce the missing materials as needed.\n\n### Errors related to entities not receiving electricity\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional electricity network. Ensure that the power source is active and capable of supplying the necessary energy.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in boilers\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and replenish them to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to inserters not receiving power\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source and that the power network is active. Check for any disconnections in the electricity network."}
