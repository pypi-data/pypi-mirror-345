Consider using suggestions provided by error messages.\n\n### Errors when placing entities beyond reach\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity if it is beyond the maximum placement distance.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract from non-existent entities\n- Ensure the entity you are trying to interact with exists at the specified position and contains the expected items."}
