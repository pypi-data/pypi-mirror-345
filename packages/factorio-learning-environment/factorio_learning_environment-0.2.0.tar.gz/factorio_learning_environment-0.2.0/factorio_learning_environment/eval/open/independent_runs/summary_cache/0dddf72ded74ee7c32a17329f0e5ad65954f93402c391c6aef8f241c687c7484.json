Mixing different types of ore in a furnace is not allowed.\n\n### Errors when crafting due to insufficient materials\n- Make sure to check the inventory for required materials before attempting to craft an item. If materials are missing, gather or produce the necessary items first.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Ensure that all electric entities, such as mining drills and labs, are connected to a power network to function properly. Check connections and power sources to resolve any power issues.\n\n### Errors due to missing fluid connections\n- Verify that all fluid-reliant structures, such as boilers and offshore pumps, are properly connected to the necessary fluid networks. Ensure that there are no missing pipes or connections.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary entities in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without having the required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items, such as pipes or electric poles, in your inventory before attempting to connect entities.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect entity references\n- Verify that the entity references in your code are correct. For example, use 'StoneFurnace' instead of 'Furnace' to avoid attribute errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Move closer to the target location before attempting to place an entity, as placement distance is limited.\n\n### Errors when crafting pipes due to insufficient iron plates\n- Ensure you have enough iron plates in your inventory or smelt more in a furnace before attempting to craft pipes.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities due to blocked connection points\n- Check the positions of entities you are trying to connect and ensure that connection points are not blocked by other objects. Adjust positions if necessary.\n\n### Errors when placing Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure that there is an unoccupied space available for placing Small Electric Poles. If an object is in the way, reposition the pole or clear the space.\n\n### Errors when electric mining drill is not receiving power\n- Ensure that the electric mining drill is connected to a powered electric network. Check the connections and power sources to resolve any power issues.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect use of isinstance and attribute checks\n- Ensure that the arguments passed to isinstance are correct types or tuples of types. Verify that objects have the expected attributes before accessing them.\n\n### Errors due to undefined names\n- Ensure that all variable names and types are correctly defined and imported in the code. Double-check for typos or missing definitions.\n\n### Errors"}
