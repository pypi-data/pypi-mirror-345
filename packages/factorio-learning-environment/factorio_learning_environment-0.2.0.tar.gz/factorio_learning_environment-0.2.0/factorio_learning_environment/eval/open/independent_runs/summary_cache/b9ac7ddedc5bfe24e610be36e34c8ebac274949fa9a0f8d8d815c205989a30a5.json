{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5), serving as an intermediary storage for extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0), fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5), collecting iron plates from the output inserter.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring iron plates from the stone furnace to the wooden chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Non-existent Entities\n- Ensure that the target entity, such as a wooden chest, exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract. Verify the entity's position and inventory contents.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items into Full Inventories\n- Check the inventory capacity of the target entity, such as a stone furnace, before inserting items. Ensure there is enough space to accommodate the items being inserted.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities without Required Inventory\n- Confirm that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity, such as a wooden chest. Gather required resources beforehand.\n\n### Errors when Crafting Items without Required Ingredients\n- Verify that all necessary ingredients are available before crafting an item. For example, ensure that raw resources like wood are gathered before attempting to craft a wooden chest."}
