{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electric Pole at position (2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position (2.5, 2.5)) - currently not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Electric Pole at position (1.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position (1.5, 1.5)) - connected to the lab at position (6.5, 6.5).\n\n### Electric Pole at position (9.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position (9.5, 6.5)) - connected to the lab at position (6.5, 6.5).\n\n### Electric Pole at position (9.5, 8.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position (9.5, 8.5)) - connected to the lab at position (6.5, 6.5).\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (6.5, 6.5)) - currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric poles not being plugged in\n- Ensure that electric poles are connected to the electric network by placing them in appropriate locations and connecting them to other power sources.\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have enough small electric poles before attempting to place them. If you run out, gather more resources to craft additional poles.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect (e.g., electric poles and labs) are within the connection range. If they are too far apart, the connection will fail.\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities in occupied spaces\n- Make sure to check that the target position for placing an entity is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place it."}
