{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex at (-10.0, -59.0)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills in a row at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), and (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Two wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5) and (-7.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore from first two drills\n- Stone furnace at (-5.0, -57.0) processing ore from third drill\n\n### Coal-Fed Smelting Line at (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces in a row at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Four wooden chests containing coal at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Four burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) feeding coal from chests to furnaces\n- Four output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- Additional burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5) and (7.5, 0.5) moving processed materials\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output Blocking\n- When placing furnaces to catch mining drill output, ensure the furnace's input position exactly matches the drill's drop position\n- Clear any items on the ground before placing new structures\n- Verify the drill's warnings are cleared after placing receiver structures\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining drills - one drill is currently out of fuel\n- Keep all machines properly fueled to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Structure Placement Issues\n- When replacing incorrectly placed structures, ensure to clear the area of any dropped items first\n- Double-check exact positioning requirements before placing structures to avoid repeated removals and replacements"}
