{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (41.0, -85.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -83.5) moving coal\n- Wooden chest at (43.5, -83.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Production System 1 at (-20.0, -54.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-19.0, -52.0) smelting iron plates\n\n### Iron Production System 2\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, -56.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -59.0) for smelting iron plates (currently not receiving materials)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- When placing entities near drop positions, ensure there are no items-on-ground blocking the placement\n- Consider clearing blocked items before attempting to place new entities\n- When placing furnaces, ensure proper spacing from mining drills to avoid collision issues\n\n### Entity Output Blocking\n- Mining drills are getting blocked by items on the ground when there's no proper output connection\n- Ensure furnaces are placed at correct positions relative to mining drill drop positions\n- Consider using inserters or transport belts to handle material movement if direct placement isn't working\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Some furnaces are placed too far from material sources, leading to NO_INGREDIENTS status\n- Ensure furnaces are placed within reach of the mining drill's drop position\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places an entity adjacent to a reference position with specified spacing and direction\n- place_entity(): Places an entity at exact coordinates\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace1, furnace2: Stone furnace entity references\n- drill drop positions: Vector2 (x,y) coordinates where mining drills output materials\n\nStatus Checks:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Entity is functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Entity output is blocked\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Furnace lacks input materials"}
