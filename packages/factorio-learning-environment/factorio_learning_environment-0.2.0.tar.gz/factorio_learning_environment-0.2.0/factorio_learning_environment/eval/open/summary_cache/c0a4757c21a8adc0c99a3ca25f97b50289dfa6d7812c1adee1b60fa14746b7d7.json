{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at position around (16, 71)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a basic iron processing line:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), currently out of fuel, mining iron ore resource.\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 72.5) placed to collect iron ore output from the mining drill.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 73.0), currently out of fuel, intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 73.5), out of fuel, configured to feed iron ore from the chest into the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 74.5), out of fuel, configured to extract iron plates from the furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 75.5) to collect iron plates output from the furnace.\n- Small electric poles at positions (17.5, 71.5) and (19.5, 73.5) providing partial power coverage, though full power connection to all inserters was not successfully established.\n\nThis structure is intended to automate iron ore mining, smelting, and collection of iron plates, but currently suffers from fuel shortages and incomplete power pole connections.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Direction argument errors when placing entities\n- When placing entities that require a direction parameter, ensure the direction argument is passed as a Direction enum object, not as an integer or other type. For example, use `Direction.DOWN` instead of `Dir.DOWN.value`.\n\n### Power pole connection failures due to nil or missing fields\n- When connecting power poles between entities, ensure that both source and target entities are valid and fully initialized. Missing or nil fields in entity data cause connection attempts to fail.\n- Verify that the entities involved support electric pole connections and that the connection function handles entity references correctly.\n\n### Fueling issues causing halted production\n- Burner mining drills, furnaces, and burner inserters require fuel to operate. Ensure these entities are supplied with appropriate fuel items (e.g., coal) to avoid \"out of fuel\" warnings and stoppages.\n- Automate fuel supply chains or manually insert fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Missing output chest detection\n- Assertions for output chests fail when the expected chest entity is not found or incorrectly referenced.\n- Confirm that output chests are placed correctly and that the code correctly identifies and references these chests before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### Inserters waiting for source items due to empty inputs\n- Inserters may show \"waiting for source items\" if the input chest or source entity is empty or not supplying items.\n- Ensure upstream entities (e.g., mining drill output chests) contain items and that inserters are fueled and powered to transfer items.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent in the provided steps."}
