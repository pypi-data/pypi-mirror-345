{"content": "I see the issue now. We need to use harvest_entity instead of pickup_entity to remove existing entities. Let's revise our approach:\n\n```python\n# Get our reference points\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\nprint(f\"Drill at {drill.position} with drop at {drill.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Move to position near drill's drop position\nmove_to(Position(x=20.0, y=-17.0))\nprint(\"Moved to position near drill\")\n\n# Try placing inserter at the optimal position between drill and furnace\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    Position(x=20.5, y=-17.5),  # Try placing it right at the drill's drop position\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT    # Face it towards the furnace\n)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to inserter\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\nprint(\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Verify the setup\nprint(f\"Inserter pickup position: {inserter.pickup_position}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter drop position: {inserter.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter status: {inserter.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {furnace.status}\")\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Places the inserter directly at the drill's drop position\n2. Faces it right towards the furnace\n3. Should be able to reach both the drill's output and furnace input\n4. Adds fuel to power the inserter\n\nLet me know if this works better!", "summary_range": "[1-2954]"}
