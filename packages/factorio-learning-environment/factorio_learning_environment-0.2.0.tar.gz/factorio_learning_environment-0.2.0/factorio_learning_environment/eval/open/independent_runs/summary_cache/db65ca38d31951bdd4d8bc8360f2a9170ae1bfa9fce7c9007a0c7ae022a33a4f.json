{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It requires coal as fuel to operate.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity from which you want to extract items before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Operation Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Regularly check and adjust the inserter's position and direction if items are not being transferred as expected.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters and Drills\n- Regularly refuel inserters and mining drills with coal to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary to prevent operational halts.\n\n### Chest Overfill and Mining Drill Warnings\n- Regularly empty the wooden chest to prevent overfilling, which can halt the mining drill's operation. Ensure that the chest has enough space to accommodate incoming resources from the drill.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly transferring iron ore to the furnace. If the furnace is not receiving ore, check the inserter's setup and ensure it is properly fueled and aligned."}
