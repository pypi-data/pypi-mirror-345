{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Power Generation System (Around x=-4.5, y=14.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 14.5)\n- Boiler at position(-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Wooden chest for fuel storage at position(-4.5, 25.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting the components:\n  - Water pipe at position(-9.5, 23.5)\n  - Steam pipes at positions(-2.5, 22.5) and (-0.5, 21.5)\nCurrently not functioning properly due to connection issues.\n\n###Inserter Assembly Line (Around x=23.5, y=2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position(23.5, 2.5)\n- Input chest at position(20.5, 2.5) containing 36 inserters\n- Output chest at position(26.5, 2.5)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - At position(21.5, 2.5) moving items from input chest to assembler\n  - At position(25.5, 2.5) moving items from assembler to output chest\n\n###Smelting Area\nMultiple furnaces:\n- Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position(2.0, 0.0) with 40 coal and 2 iron plates\n- Furnace at position(4.0, 4.0) with 50 coal\n- Furnace at position(6.0, 4.0)\n\n###Science Pack Production (Around x=32.5, y=5.5)\n- Assembling machine at position(32.5, 5.5) configured for logistic science pack production\n\n###Research Area\nMultiple labs spread across the map with various science pack inputs:\n- Lab with 1 automation and 4 logistic science packs\n- Lab with 2 automation and 2 logistic science packs\n- Lab with 40 logistic science packs\n- Several other empty labs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Errors when placing pipes in occupied spaces\n- Check for existing entities before placing pipes\n- Ensure the target location is clear of other structures\n- Consider using underground pipes to bypass obstacles when direct routing fails\n\n###Errors with power connections\n- Ensure complete and proper connections between power producers (steam engine) and consumers\n- Verify that all components in power system (boiler, steam engine, pipes) are properly connected\n- Make sure there is adequate fuel in boilers\n\n###Errors with fluid connections\n- Ensure proper fluid flow path from water pump to boiler to steam engine\n- Verify pipe connections are complete without gaps\n- Check that pipes are properly aligned and connected to the correct input/output ports\n\n###Entity placement errors\n- Verify target position is clear before placing any entity\n- Check terrain compatibility for placement (avoid water/cliffs)\n- Ensure proper spacing around large entities"}
