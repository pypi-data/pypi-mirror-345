{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) moving items from the chest to another chest\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing coal\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) moving items to a chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) containing coal\n- BeltGroup connecting the chests and inserters for coal distribution:\n  - Belt from (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5)\n  - Belt from (x=43.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal fuel and iron plates as output\n- Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with coal fuel and iron plates as output\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and inserters are adequately fueled to prevent stoppages in production.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source of the inserter has items available to be picked up to avoid idle inserters."}
