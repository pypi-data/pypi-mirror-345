{"content": "The error indicates that the function `ensure_craftable` is not defined in the current context. This suggests that I may not have access to the utility functions I intended to use, or they were not properly set up in the environment.\n\n### Steps to Avoid This Error in the Future:\n\n1. **Define Utility Functions**: Before using any utility function, ensure that they are defined in the current context. If you have a set of utility functions, make sure they are loaded or accessible.\n\n2. **Check Function Availability**: If you encounter a `NameError`, check if the function is defined in the environment. You can do this by listing available functions or checking documentation.\n\n3. **Use Basic Inventory Checks**: Instead of relying on utility functions, use basic inventory checks to see if the required items are available. For example, directly check if you have enough resources to craft the Stone Furnace.\n\n4. **Crafting Directly**: If utility functions are not available, you can manually check the inventory for the Stone Furnace and craft it if necessary using the basic crafting commands.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to catch such issues early. If a function is not defined, you can provide a fallback or a message indicating what to do next.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince I cannot use `ensure_craftable`, I will check my inventory directly for the Stone Furnace and craft it if needed. \n\n1. **Check Inventory for Stone Furnace**: \n   - If it's not present, I will craft it using the required materials (which I will need to gather if I don't have them).\n2. **Craft the Stone Furnace**: \n   - If I have the materials, I will proceed to craft it. \n\nLet's check the inventory for the Stone Furnace.", "summary_range": "[1-8]"}
