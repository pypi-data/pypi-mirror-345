{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no successfully placed structures or entities on the map as all attempts to place wooden chests have failed due to obstructions or errors. The agent's inventory remains unchanged with 2 wooden chests, indicating no successful placements.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Check for nearby obstructions and ensure the target tile is clear of any entities.\n\n### Errors related to data type and function usage\n- When using data structures or functions, ensure that you are using them correctly. For example, avoid treating non-callable objects like 'Position' as callable functions. This can be mitigated by reviewing the intended use of objects and functions in the code.\n\n### Errors in building box dimensions\n- Ensure that the dimensions for building boxes are correctly defined. For instance, verify that the width and height are correctly specified and compatible with the expected data types. Consult documentation or error references for guidance on resolving type-related issues.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources available in the inventory before attempting actions that require them, such as supplying iron ore to furnaces. Regularly check inventory levels and plan resource gathering accordingly."}
