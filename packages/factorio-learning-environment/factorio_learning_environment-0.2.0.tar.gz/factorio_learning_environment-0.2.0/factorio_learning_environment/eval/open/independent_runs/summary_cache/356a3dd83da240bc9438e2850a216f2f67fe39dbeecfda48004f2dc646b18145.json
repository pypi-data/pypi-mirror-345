{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) to another burner inserter at position (6.5, 0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing entity at the target position before placing a new entity. Consider increasing spacing or changing the direction or reference position if placement fails due to an occupied tile.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a transport belt. Belts cannot be connected directly to a chest.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, ensure you have enough wooden chests or the materials needed to craft them.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without raw resources\n- Gather necessary raw resources before attempting to craft items. For example, wood must be gathered before crafting wooden chests."}
