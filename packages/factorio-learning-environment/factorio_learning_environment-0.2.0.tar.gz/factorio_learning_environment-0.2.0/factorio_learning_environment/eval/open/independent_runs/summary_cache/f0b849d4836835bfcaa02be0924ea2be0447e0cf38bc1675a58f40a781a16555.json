{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -86.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -84.5).\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (43.0, -86.0) with a drop position at (43.5, -84.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (43.5, -84.5) for storing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -82.5) containing 34 coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) (empty).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -79.0) with 81 iron plates in the result inventory.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-17.0, -52.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -50.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-16.5, -50.5) (empty).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -51.0) with 74 iron plates in the result inventory.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0) with 72 iron plates in the result inventory.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-13.5, -51.5) (empty).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- **Issue:** Chests at drop positions (43.5, -84.5) and (-16.5, -50.5) are full, preventing mining drills from continuing operations.\n- **Solution:** Regularly empty the chests at these positions to allow mining drills to continue producing resources.\n\n#### Errors Related to Furnace Operations\n- **Issue:** Furnaces at positions (43.0, -79.0), (-15.0, -51.0), and (-13.0, -50.0) have no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Solution:** Ensure a steady supply of iron ore and coal to the furnaces to maintain continuous smelting operations.\n\n#### Errors Related to Blocked Output\n- **Issue:** The burner mining drill at position (41.0, -86.0) has its output blocked by an item on the ground.\n- **Solution:** Clear the item from the ground or place a sink entity (e.g., a chest or belt) to accept the output.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **`extract_from_chest(x: float, y: float, item: str, count: int)`**\n  - **Success:** Extracts the specified number of items from the chest at the given position.\n  - **Failure:** Fails if the chest is empty or does not contain the specified item.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **`inventory: dict`** - Contains the current inventory of the agent, including items like coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- **`entities_on_map: list`** - Lists all entities currently on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
