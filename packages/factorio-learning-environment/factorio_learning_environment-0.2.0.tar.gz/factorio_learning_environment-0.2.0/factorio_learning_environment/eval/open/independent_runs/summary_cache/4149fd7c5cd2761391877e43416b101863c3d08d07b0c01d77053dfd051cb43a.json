{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5) which is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n- Small electric pole (position 50.5, 50.5) which is part of the electricity network but not effectively connected to the steam engine.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 1.0, 1.0) and a furnace (position 1.0, 1.0).\n- Burner mining drill (position 10.0, 1.0) and a furnace (position 10.0, 1.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position 8.5, 1.5) and inserter (position 7.5, 1.5) that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position 1.0, 1.0 to the assembling machine at position 8.5, 1.5.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Ensure that the steam engine has available space for coal before attempting to insert items. Check if the engine is operational and accepting fuel.\n\n### Errors related to power connection checks\n- Review the code for any undefined variables or functions, particularly the 'builtins' reference. Ensure that all necessary libraries and functions are correctly defined and accessible.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities in the target position."}
