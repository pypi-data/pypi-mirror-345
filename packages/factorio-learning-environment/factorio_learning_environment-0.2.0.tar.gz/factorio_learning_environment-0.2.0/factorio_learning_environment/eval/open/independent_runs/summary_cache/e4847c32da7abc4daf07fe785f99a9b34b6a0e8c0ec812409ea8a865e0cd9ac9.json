{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-18.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n\n### Copper Ore Storage Facility at Position (-23.5, -69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest and the inserter.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring iron plates to the chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage Chests\n- Wooden chest at position (-20.5, -63.5) currently empty.\n- Wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple belt groups connecting various entities for resource transport, including:\n  - Belt group connecting positions (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5).\n  - Belt group connecting positions (-18.5, -71.5) to (-16.5, -71.5).\n  - Additional belt groups facilitating movement of resources between mining drills, furnaces, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the input inventory and supply chain to maintain a steady flow of resources.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items. Ensure that the source inventory is not empty and that the inserter is correctly positioned to pick up items.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Connections\n- Confirm that transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to ensure smooth resource flow. Misaligned belts can disrupt the supply chain.\n\n### Errors with Resource Extraction\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing structures."}
