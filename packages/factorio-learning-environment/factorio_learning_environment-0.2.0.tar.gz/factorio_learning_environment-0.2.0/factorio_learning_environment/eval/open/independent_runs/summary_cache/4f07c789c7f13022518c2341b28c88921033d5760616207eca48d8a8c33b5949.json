{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Station at position(24.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest (23.5, -16.5) containing 112 coal\n\n###Iron Mining Station at position(-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest (-14.5, 21.5) containing 583 iron ore\n\n###Iron Smelting Area at position(-10.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (-11.0, 20.0) with 23 coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace (-9.0, 20.0) with 23 coal as fuel\n\n###Copper Processing Complex at position(22.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (20.0, 20.0)\n- Input wooden chest (20.5, 21.5)\n- Middle wooden chest (22.5, 21.5) containing 382 copper ore\n- Stone furnace (24.0, 20.0) with 50 coal as fuel\n- Output wooden chest (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Burner inserter (21.5, 21.5) moving items from input chest to middle chest\n- Burner inserter (23.5, 21.5) moving items from middle chest to furnace\n- Burner inserter (24.5, 18.5) moving processed plates to output chest\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter placement and configuration errors\n- Ensure inserters are properly aligned with their pickup and drop positions\n- Check that inserters have valid source and destination entities before placement\n- Verify the direction of inserters matches the intended flow of materials\n\n### Resource management issues\n- Mining drills are out of fuel - implement regular refueling system\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ingredients to operate efficiently\n\n### Entity placement coordination\n- When placing connected entities (like mining drill -> chest -> inserter -> furnace chains), ensure all components are properly aligned and can interact with each other\n- Verify space availability before placing new entities to avoid overlap issues"}
