{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 24.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). \n- The steam engine is currently not connected to power and has a status of NOT_CONNECTED.\n- The boiler is out of fuel and has a status of NO_FUEL.\n- The offshore pump is operational with a status of WORKING.\n\n### Lab at position(0, 0)\nConsists of a lab (position 0, 0) and another lab (position 5, 5). \n- Both labs currently have a status of NO_POWER.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=30506, position -8.5, -6.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=30507, position -7.5, -7.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=30508, position -11.5, -4.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=30509, position -9.5, -5.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=30511, position -9.5, 21.5, fluid=water)\n\n### Furnaces\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Furnace (position 0, 0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS.\n- Furnace (position 5, 5) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS.\n\n### Electric poles\nMultiple small electric poles are present around the steam engine, including:\n- Small electric pole (position 0.5, -12.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -12.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -1.5, -11.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -0.5, -11.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -11.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -10.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 0.5, -11.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -2.5, -9.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -2.5, -8.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -9.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -0.5, -7.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -1.5, -7.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -7.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 0.5, -7.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with steam engine connection\n- The steam engine is not connected to power. Ensure that the electric poles are properly connected to the steam engine and check the distance between them.\n\n### Errors when using electric pole attributes\n- Avoid using attributes that do not exist on the object. For example, the error occurred due to trying to access the 'energy' attribute of the 'ElectricityGroup' object which does not exist. Verify the available attributes of an object before accessing them.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for occupied tiles or invalid positions.\n\n### Errors with lab power supply\n- Both labs are currently showing NO_POWER. Ensure that they are connected to a power source and that the power source is operational."}
