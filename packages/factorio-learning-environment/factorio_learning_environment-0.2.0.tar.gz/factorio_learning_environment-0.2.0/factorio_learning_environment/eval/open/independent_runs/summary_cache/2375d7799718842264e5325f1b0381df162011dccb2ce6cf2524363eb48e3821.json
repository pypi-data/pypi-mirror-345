{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5).\n- The boiler is connected to the offshore pump and is responsible for heating water to produce steam.\n- The steam engine utilizes the steam produced by the boiler to generate electricity.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0).\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0).\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with boiler and steam engine connections\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected with pipes. Check the positions of the pipes and ensure they are not obstructed or incorrectly placed.\n- Verify that the boiler is producing steam before attempting to connect it to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors when using PipeGroup attributes\n- The 'PipeGroup' object does not have a 'fluid' attribute. Review the API documentation to ensure correct usage of attributes and methods for the 'PipeGroup' object.\n\n### Errors when asserting connection status\n- Before asserting the connection status of the steam engine, ensure that all necessary connections are established and that the boiler is functioning correctly."}
