{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5) which is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) which is supposed to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. The pickup position must match the chest's position for successful item transfer.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position. Misalignment will prevent the transfer of iron ore to the furnace.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as the burner mining drill and inserter, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Resource Transfer Errors\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving iron ore. Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly configured to transfer items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available in the inventory before attempting to insert items into entities."}
