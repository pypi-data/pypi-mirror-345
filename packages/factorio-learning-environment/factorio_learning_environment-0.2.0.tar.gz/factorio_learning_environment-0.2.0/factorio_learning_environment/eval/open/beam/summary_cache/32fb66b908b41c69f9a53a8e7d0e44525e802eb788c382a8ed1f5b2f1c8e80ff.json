{"content": "The error message indicates that the variable `selected_boiler` is not defined at the point where you are trying to use it. This suggests that the script is not correctly retrieving or assigning the boiler entity to the `selected_boiler` variable.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and fix this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Entity Retrieval**: Make sure that the `boilers` list is being populated correctly. If the list is empty, `selected_boiler` will not be assigned.\n\n2. **Check Entity Assignment**: Verify that `selected_boiler` is being assigned a value from the `boilers` list before it is used. This should happen after confirming that the `boilers` list is not empty.\n\n3. **Add Debugging Output**: Add print statements to check the contents of the `boilers` list before attempting to assign `selected_boiler`.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to catch cases where the `boilers` list might be empty, and provide a meaningful error message.\n\nHere's a revised version of the relevant section of the script:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Initiating a detailed diagnostic procedure...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Retrieve necessary entities\n    print(\"Retrieving entities...\")\n\n    boilers = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    print(f\"Boilers Retrieved: {len(boilers)}\")\n\n    # Check if boilers are available\n    if not boilers:\n        raise AssertionError(\"No boilers found in the environment.\")\n\n    # Assign the first boiler to selected_boiler\n    selected_boiler = boilers[0]\n    print(f\"Selected Boiler: {selected_boiler}\")\n\n    # Attempt to move to the boiler's position\n    print(f\"Attempting to move to boiler at position: {selected_boiler.position}\")\n    if not move_to(selected_boiler.position):\n        print(f\"Failed to move to {selected_boiler.position}\")\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Movement to Boiler failed\")\n\n    # Continue with the rest of the diagnostic procedure...\n\nexcept AssertionError as ae:\n    print(f\"Assertion Error, some entities are missing: {ae}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Unexpected error occurred during diagnostics: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Check Entity Lists**: Always verify that lists of entities are populated before accessing elements.\n- **Error Handling**: Use assertions or conditional checks to handle cases where expected entities are missing.\n- **Debugging Output**: Use print statements to output the state of variables, especially when diagnosing issues.", "summary_range": "[1-342]"}
