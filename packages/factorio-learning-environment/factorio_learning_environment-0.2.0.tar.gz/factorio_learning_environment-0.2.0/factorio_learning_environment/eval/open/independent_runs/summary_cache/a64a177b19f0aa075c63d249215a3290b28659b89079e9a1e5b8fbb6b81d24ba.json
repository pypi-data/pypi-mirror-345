The agent made several attempts to supply research by placing a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5), but all placement and crafting efforts failed because no Lab was produced or added into inventory. No additional built structures have been detected in these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval  \n  \u2013 When invoking get_entities(), use the correct signature. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or passing extra positional parameters that the function does not expect.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and None Validation  \n  \u2013 Always verify that required items exist in inventory before attempting placement. In addition, check that functions return valid iterables (not None) before iterating over their results, and implement proper fallback handling.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Dependency and Resource Management  \n  \u2013 Prior to crafting a Lab, confirm that all necessary sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available or producible. Ensure that the production chain\u2014such as sufficient iron and copper plate smelting\u2014is correctly set up so that higher-tier recipes can be fulfilled.\n\n\u2022 Overall Resource Chain Verification  \n  \u2013 Recheck recipe requirements and the availability of foundational resources (like iron-plate and copper-plate) using the correct processing methods, so that production failures due to missing ingredients are avoided."}
