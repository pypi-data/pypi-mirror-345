{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0), fueled with coal, currently holding 87 iron plates.\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0), fueled with coal, currently holding 87 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), currently out of fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5), waiting for source items, connected to the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5), empty.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5), containing 72 units of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5), waiting for source items, connected to the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5), containing 787 units of coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting the wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5) to another point, transporting coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the source items they are supposed to handle. Check that the source entities are not empty or out of resources.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills to maintain continuous operation and avoid production halts."}
