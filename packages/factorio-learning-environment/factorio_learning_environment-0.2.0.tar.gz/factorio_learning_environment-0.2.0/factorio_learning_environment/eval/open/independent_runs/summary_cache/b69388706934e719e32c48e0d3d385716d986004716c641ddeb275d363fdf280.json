{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), (-9.0, -48.0)\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore. It consists of:\n- Three stone furnaces located at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0).\n- Three burner inserters positioned at (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), and (-8.5, -49.5) which are responsible for moving items between chests and furnaces.\n- Several chests for storage and transfer of materials, including iron chests and wooden chests at various positions around the furnaces.\n\n#### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nThis system is designed to mine and distribute coal. It includes:\n- A burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Several iron chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- A burner inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) for transferring coal and iron plates between chests and the furnace.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining System at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis system is focused on mining iron ore and consists of:\n- A burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- Iron chests and wooden chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-12.5, -49.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when Extracting from Furnaces and Chests\n- Ensure that the inventory has enough space before attempting to extract items from furnaces or chests. This will prevent errors related to full inventories.\n\n#### Errors when Refueling or Supplying Iron Ore\n- Verify that there is sufficient iron ore in the inventory before attempting to supply furnaces. This will avoid errors related to the absence of iron ore.\n\n#### Errors when Harvesting with Full Inventory\n- Always check that there is enough space in the inventory before harvesting resources to prevent errors due to a full inventory.\n\n#### Errors with Inserter Blockages\n- Regularly clear blockages at inserter drop positions to ensure smooth operation and prevent delays in production.\n\n#### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all burner inserters and drills are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation and avoid interruptions."}
