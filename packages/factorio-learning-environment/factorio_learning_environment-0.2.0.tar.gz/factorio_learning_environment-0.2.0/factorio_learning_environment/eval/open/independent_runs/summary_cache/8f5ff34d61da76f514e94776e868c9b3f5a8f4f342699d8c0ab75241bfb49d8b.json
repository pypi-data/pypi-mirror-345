{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\n\n### Lab Setup at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to the electricity network\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the lab to the steam engine\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Not enough materials to craft items\n- Ensure you have the required materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items like small electric poles and copper cables.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to connect entities like steam engines and labs using small electric poles.\n- Verify the connection paths and ensure all required entities are present and correctly positioned.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined before use. Consider using suggestions provided in error messages to correct undefined names.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that conditions expected in assertions are met before executing them, such as ensuring the steam engine is working before asserting its status.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Verify the existence and correct positioning of entities like labs before attempting operations on them."}
