{"content": "The error indicates that you attempted to craft stone bricks directly from your inventory without using the appropriate crafting machine. In Factorio, certain items cannot be crafted directly in your inventory; they require a specific machine, such as a stone furnace, to process the raw materials.\n\n### Tips to Avoid This Error in the Future:\n\n1. **Use the Correct Crafting Machine**: Always check if the item you want to craft requires a specific machine. In this case, stone bricks must be crafted in a stone furnace.\n\n2. **Set Up the Crafting Process**:\n   - First, ensure you have a stone furnace available in your inventory. If not, craft one using the required materials.\n   - Place the stone furnace in a valid location.\n   - Insert the raw stones into the furnace, along with the necessary fuel (like coal).\n\n3. **Wait for the Crafting Process**: After inserting the materials into the furnace, wait for the crafting process to complete before retrieving the stone bricks.\n\n4. **Check Recipes**: Familiarize yourself with the recipes and the machines required for crafting different items. This will help you plan your resource gathering and crafting actions more effectively.\n\n5. **Use Helper Functions**: If available, utilize helper functions to automate the crafting process, ensuring that all prerequisites (like machines and resources) are met before attempting to craft.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can streamline your crafting process and avoid similar errors in the future.", "summary_range": "[1-66]"}
