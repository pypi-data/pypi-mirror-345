{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory Interface (approx. center between (1.5,19.5) and (3.5,17.5))\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Cable Factory Input Chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5) serving as the interface for incoming materials.\n\u2013 Factory Burner Inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5) for handling raw materials.\n\u2013 Dedicated Burner Inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) placed at the factory interface.\n\u2013 Assembling Machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5) tasked with copper-cable production.\n\n### Extraction Belt Depot (core at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5))\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Wooden Chest at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) serving as an isolated belt depot.\n\u2013 Transport Belt Segment at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) placed adjacent to the depot chest to extend belt connectivity.\n\u2013 Depot Burner Inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) whose pickup position (acting as the final target) is Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) for receiving items.\n\n### Extraction System Node\nConsists of the following entity:\n\u2013 Extraction System Burner Inserter at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5) with drop position Position(x=-3.5, y=28.5) used to initiate the extraction connection.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2013 Transport Belt Connection Errors:\n\u2003\u2022 Repeated failures occurred when connecting transport belts because the target entity was interpreted as a Prototype.SteamEngine.\n\u2003\u2022 To avoid this, always add an inserter to relay items into the intended target instead of connecting directly to non-inserter entities.\n\n\u2013 Placement Range Issue:\n\u2003\u2022 A wooden chest placement failed because the target position was too far from the player\u2019s current position.\n\u2003\u2022 Ensure the player moves within the allowed placement range (max distance 10) before attempting to place an entity.\n\n\u2013 Variable Reference Error:\n\u2003\u2022 An error arose from a NameError (\u201ctarget_chest\u201d is not defined) indicating an invalid variable reference.\n\u2003\u2022 Verify that all variables referencing entities are correctly defined and accessible in the current scope.\n\n\u2013 Inventory Shortage:\n\u2003\u2022 An error indicating \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d occurred during an attempted placement.\n\u2003\u2022 Confirm that the required items are available in the inventory before executing placement actions.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n(No agent-defined functions were reported.)"}
