If not, gather more resources.\n\n### Errors when crafting sub-ingredients\n- When crafting complex items, ensure that all sub-ingredients are available and that the crafting process is compatible with the available machines or methods.\n\n### Errors due to attempting to craft locked recipes\n- Before attempting to craft an item, ensure that the recipe is unlocked by researching the necessary technology.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Confirm that you have the item in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a furnace or any other entity.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory to connect entities, such as pipes for connecting fluid systems.\n\n### Errors due to attempting to place entities without available resources\n- Verify that you have gathered the necessary raw resources before attempting to craft or place entities that require them.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft items requiring a crafting machine\n- Some items require a crafting machine or furnace for production. Ensure you have access to the appropriate equipment before attempting to craft these items.\n\n### Errors when attempting to find or use nonexistent entities\n- Confirm the existence of entities like steam engines before attempting to interact with or use them in your operations.\n\n### Errors due to blocked connection points\n- Ensure that the positions of entities you are trying to connect are not blocked. Reposition entities if necessary to unblock connections.\n\n### Errors due to entity placement overlapping with water\n- Avoid placing entities where their footprint overlaps with water. Choose a different location that is suitable for placement.\n\n### Errors due to attempting to place entities too far from player position\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity to ensure it is within the allowable distance.\n\n### Errors due to missing raw resources for crafting\n- Gather raw resources like wood, which cannot be crafted, before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n### Errors due to attempting to connect entities with undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables used in connection logic are defined and correctly referenced in the code.\n\n### Errors when attempting to pick up nonexistent entities\n- Verify the presence of the entity at the specified location before attempting to pick it up."}
