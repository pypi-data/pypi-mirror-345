{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Collection System at position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -86.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Transport belt** at position (41.5, -84.5) to move coal from the drill.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5) to transfer coal from the transport belt to the chest.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (41.5, -82.5) to store the collected coal.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0) for smelting operations. Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before placing an entity. For example, the agent attempted to place a wooden chest at (41.5, -83.5) but failed due to an existing inserter.\n\n#### Errors with inserter alignment\n- Ensure the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the transport belt and chest. The agent encountered an error when the inserter at (41.5, -83.5) was not aligned with the transport belt at (41.5, -84.5). Rotating the inserter resolved this issue.\n\n#### Repeated clearing and replacing transport belts\n- Avoid repeatedly clearing and replacing the same transport belt unless necessary. This wastes resources and time. Plan belt placements carefully to minimize such actions.\n\n#### Refueling burner entities\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. The agent successfully refueled the burner mining drill at (41.0, -86.0) to resume coal extraction."}
