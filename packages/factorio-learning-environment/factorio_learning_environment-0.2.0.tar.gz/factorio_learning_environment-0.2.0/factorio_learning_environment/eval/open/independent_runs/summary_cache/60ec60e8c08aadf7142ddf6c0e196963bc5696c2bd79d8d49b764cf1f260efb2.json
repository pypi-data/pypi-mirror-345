{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of a boiler (position -4.5, 23.0) connected to an offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5) via pipes. The boiler is out of fuel and has no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-7.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5) which is working and connected to the boiler.\n\n### Pipe connections\nIncludes multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, with some pipes connected to the offshore pump and boiler.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities you are trying to connect are within range and that there are no obstacles in between. Move closer to the entities if necessary.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
