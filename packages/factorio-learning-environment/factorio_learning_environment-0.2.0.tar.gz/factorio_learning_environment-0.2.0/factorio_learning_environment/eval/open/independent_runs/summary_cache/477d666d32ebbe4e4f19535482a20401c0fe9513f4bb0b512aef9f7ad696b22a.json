{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) fueled by coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole at position (5.5, -60.5), not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at position (6.5, -59.5) for storage.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), not connected to the fluid system.\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0), lacking input liquid and not connected to the fluid system.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5), not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n\n### Lab at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups at various positions, all currently empty and not connected to any fluid systems.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, currently not supplying power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available before attempting to craft items. Small Electric Poles require wood and copper cables, and wood must be gathered as it is a raw resource.\n\n### Errors with Connecting Pipes\n- Verify the connection paths for pipes to ensure they are correctly aligned and connected to the intended entities.\n\n### Errors with Power Network Connections\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functioning electricity network. Check that the network has the necessary components and is properly configured.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Check the power supply to inserters and ensure they are connected to a powered electric pole."}
