{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Lab Facility\n- Lab with status indicating missing science packs, located within the electricity network\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) for fluid transport\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) for water transport\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=18.5, y=-3.5) for water transport\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles spanning multiple positions, providing power to connected entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft complex items like electronic circuits and labs. For example, copper-cable requires copper-plates, which must be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel and Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and supply fuel to boilers and furnaces to avoid interruptions in production. Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established to avoid warnings like \"no input liquid\" or \"no fluid present in connections.\" Ensure that the steam engine is connected to a functioning boiler and offshore pump.\n\n### Errors in Lab Operations\n- Provide the necessary science packs to labs to enable research activities. Ensure labs are connected to the power network and have the required inputs for operation."}
