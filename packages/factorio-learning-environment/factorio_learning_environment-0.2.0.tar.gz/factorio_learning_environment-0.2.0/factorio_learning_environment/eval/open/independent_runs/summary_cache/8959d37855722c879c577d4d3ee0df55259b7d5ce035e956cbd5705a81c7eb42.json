{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid or fluid present in connections.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 20039, position -9.5, -6.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 20043, position -15.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 20046, position -7.5, 23.5, status FULL_OUTPUT)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 20050, position -18.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 20054, position -21.5, 28.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 20053, position -20.5, 29.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes is clear of any existing objects to avoid placement failures.\n- If a pipe cannot be placed due to overlapping with another entity, consider moving the pipe to a different location.\n\n### Errors when attempting to pick up pipes\n- Verify that the pipe exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. If the pipe has already been removed or does not exist, this will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when connecting to water\n- When placing an offshore pump, ensure that the position is not overlapping with water to avoid placement issues. \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
