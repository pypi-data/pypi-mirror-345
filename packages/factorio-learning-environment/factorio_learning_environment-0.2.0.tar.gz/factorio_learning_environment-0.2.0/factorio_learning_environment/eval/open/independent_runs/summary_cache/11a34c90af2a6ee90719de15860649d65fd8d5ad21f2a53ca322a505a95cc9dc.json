{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5)\n- Connected to a pipe group (position -11.5, 20.5) that leads to other pipes.\n\n### Steam engine at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5)\n- Connected to a small electric pole (position -27.5, 29.5)\n\n### Boiler at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -18.0, -49.0)\n- Connected to a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel.\n\n### Furnace at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel.\n\n### Lab at position(unknown)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position unknown) which is currently not powered.\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles (multiple positions including -27.5, 29.5) forming a network.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., steam engine) is within range and can accept the item (e.g., coal) before attempting to insert.\n\n### Errors when connecting power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and has a source of water. Check connections and ensure that the electric pole is within range.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power (like the lab and steam engine) are connected to a functioning power network and that there are no breaks in the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it."}
