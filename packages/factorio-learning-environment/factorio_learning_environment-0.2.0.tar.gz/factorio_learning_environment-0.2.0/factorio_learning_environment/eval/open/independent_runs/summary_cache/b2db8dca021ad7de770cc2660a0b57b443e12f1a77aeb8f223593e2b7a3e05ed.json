{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing extracted resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring resources from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5) and (-11.5, -46.5) for moving materials between chests and furnaces.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -46.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Multiple Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Secondary Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) for additional smelting operations.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) for transferring materials to and from the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Blockage\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is clear and has space to accept items. Regularly check and clear blockages at inserter drop positions.\n\n### Errors with Extraction from Furnace\n- Verify that the furnace contains the items you wish to extract before attempting extraction. Ensure the quantity specified for extraction is available in the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter has items available for transfer. Regularly supply the source with necessary materials to avoid idle inserters.\n\n### Errors with Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the required raw materials to maintain continuous operation and prevent idle time."}
