Use `spacing` parameter to adjust the distance or change the direction of placement.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before calling `insert_item`.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n#### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before using them. For example, `furnaces` was not defined in the code, leading to a `NameError`.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use inserters to transfer items into chests. Belts cannot directly input items into chests.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check if the target tile is occupied before placing an entity. Remove any existing entities if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert items into full entities\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., furnace or inserter) has space for the items before inserting. For example, furnaces cannot accept more coal if their fuel inventory is full."}
