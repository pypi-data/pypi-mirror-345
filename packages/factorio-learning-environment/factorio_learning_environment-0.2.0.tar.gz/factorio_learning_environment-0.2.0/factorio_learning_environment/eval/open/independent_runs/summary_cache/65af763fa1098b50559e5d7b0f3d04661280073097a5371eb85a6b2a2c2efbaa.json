{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), and (-6, -59) mining iron ore\n- Two wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5) and (-7.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore from first two drills\n- Stone furnace at (-5.0, -57.0) meant to process ore from third drill\n\n### Coal Processing Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n- Four wooden chests containing coal at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Four burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving coal from chests to furnaces\n- Four wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5) for output collection\n- Four burner inserters for output handling:\n  - Three at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5) moving items from furnaces to output chests\n  - One at (7.5, 0.5) facing left for additional output handling\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Furnace Placement for Mining Output\n- When placing a furnace to collect mining drill output, ensure it is properly aligned with the drill's drop position\n- Verify there are no items blocking the path between the mining drill and furnace\n- Check that the furnace is within reach of the drill's output position\n\n### Mining Drill Output Blockage\n- Clear any items on the ground between mining drills and their output targets\n- Ensure proper spacing between mining equipment and output collectors\n- Verify that receiving entities (furnaces/chests) are correctly positioned to accept items from the drill's drop position\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep mining drills fueled to prevent work stoppage\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills to maintain continuous operation"}
