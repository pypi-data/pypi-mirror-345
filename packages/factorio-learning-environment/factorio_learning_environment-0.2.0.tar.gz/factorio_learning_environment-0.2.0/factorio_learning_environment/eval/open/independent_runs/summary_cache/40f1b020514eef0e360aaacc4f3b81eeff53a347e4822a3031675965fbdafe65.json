{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and iron-plate output.\n  - Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and iron-plate output.\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - Inserter at position (1.5, 1.5) directed to the right, connected to both furnaces.\n  - Inserter at position (3.5, 1.5) directed to the right, connected to the second furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources\n- Ensure you gather all necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, wood must be gathered before crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target position is free from other entities before placing a new entity. Adjust the position or direction if necessary to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to insert them into entities.\n\n### NameError due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are properly defined and initialized before use. Double-check variable names for typos or incorrect references.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specific position before attempting to interact with it. Use appropriate checks to confirm the entity's presence."}
