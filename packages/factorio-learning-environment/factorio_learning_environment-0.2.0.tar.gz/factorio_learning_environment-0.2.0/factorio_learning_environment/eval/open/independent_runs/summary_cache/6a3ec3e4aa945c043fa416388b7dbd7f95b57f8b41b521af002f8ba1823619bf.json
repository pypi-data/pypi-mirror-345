{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure the player is within the maximum allowed distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and function\n- Double-check the alignment and setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning properly, leading to resource flow issues.\n\n### Insufficient fuel for operations\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like inserters and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Ensure there is an adequate supply of coal or other fuel sources in the inventory to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Chest capacity and resource management\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly extract resources or expand storage capacity to maintain workflow efficiency.\n\n### Furnace not receiving ingredients\n- Ensure that the inserter is properly configured to transfer resources from the chest to the furnace. Check for any blockages or misalignments that might prevent the transfer of iron ore to the furnace for smelting."}
