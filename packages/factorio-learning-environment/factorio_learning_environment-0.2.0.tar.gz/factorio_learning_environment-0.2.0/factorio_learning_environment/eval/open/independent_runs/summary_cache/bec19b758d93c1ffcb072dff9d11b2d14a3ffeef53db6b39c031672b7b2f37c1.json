{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest. Currently fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore. Currently contains 12 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently out of fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment or lack of fuel.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Reposition and align inserters as needed to ensure proper item flow.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel. This is crucial for maintaining continuous operation in automated setups.\n\n### Chest Overfill and Mining Drill Stoppage\n- Monitor the chest's inventory to prevent overfilling, which can halt the mining drill's operation. Regularly extract materials from the chest to maintain space for new resources.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting. Check the inserter setup and fuel levels to maintain a steady supply of raw materials to the furnace."}
