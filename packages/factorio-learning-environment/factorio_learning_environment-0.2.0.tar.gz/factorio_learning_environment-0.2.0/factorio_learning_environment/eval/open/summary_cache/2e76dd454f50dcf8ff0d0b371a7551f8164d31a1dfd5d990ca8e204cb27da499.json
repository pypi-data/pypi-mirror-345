{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and operational, though output inventory frequently full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational, feeding chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt persists, limiting mining drill throughput.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and iron plate storage with power connectivity and inserter fueling maintained.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel despite recent coal insertion attempts.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) connected by pipes to boiler, operational and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5), forming part of power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity but boiler fuel shortages cause temporary power risk.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to output chest at (25.5, 82.5).\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates, but assembling machine input inventory remains empty.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5) powering assembling machine.\n- Inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and correctly positioned.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production but remains idle due to lack of iron plate input to the assembling machine.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt affecting mining drill operation\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report output blockage due to full furnace output inventory and blocked belts.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and ensure chests have capacity to accept iron plates.\n- Regularly monitor furnace output and belt flow to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Boiler fuel shortage causing power interruptions\n- Despite repeated coal insertions, the boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is reported out of fuel at times, risking steam engine shutdown.\n- Ensure continuous coal supply to boiler by verifying inserter fuel and coal availability.\n- Consider adding buffer chests or additional inserters to maintain boiler fueling.\n\n### Assembling machine idle due to missing input materials\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) remains unable to craft iron gear wheels due to empty input inventory.\n- Iron plates are extracted and reinserted into input chest at (21.5, 75.5) but do not reach assembling machine input.\n- Verify inserter connections and belt routing between input chest and assembling machine.\n- Ensure iron plates are delivered to assembling machine input to enable crafting.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts with small electric poles\n- Repeated failures to place small electric poles near steam engine (0.5, 6.5), iron mining area (17.5, 72.5), furnace (18.0, 75.0), and assembling machine (25.5, 80.5) due to existing entities occupying target tiles.\n- Avoid by checking tile occupancy before placement, increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or selecting alternative reference positions.\n\n### Inserter fuel and positioning management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and correctly positioned, preventing stoppages.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and positioning to maintain smooth operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined or invoked in the given steps."}
