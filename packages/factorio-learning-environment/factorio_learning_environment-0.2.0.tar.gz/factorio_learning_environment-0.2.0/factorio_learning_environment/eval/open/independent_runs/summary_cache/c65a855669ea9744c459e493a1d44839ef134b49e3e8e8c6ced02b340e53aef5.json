{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 16-23)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Functional Power Plant at (-9.5, 0.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) facing right\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 1.5) facing right (contains 2 coal)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 1.5) facing right\n- Connected with water pipes between pump and boiler\n- Connected with steam pipes between boiler and engine\n- Small electric pole at (-2.5, 3.5) connecting to power network\n\n### Smelting and Production Area\n- Iron smelting furnace at (5.0, 0.0) (contains 14 iron ore, 37 coal)\n- Copper smelting furnace at (5.0, 4.0) (contains 15 copper ore, 17 coal, 16 copper plates)\n- Gear assembler at (8.5, 0.5) (waiting for iron plates)\n- Cable assembler at (8.5, 4.5) (contains 12 copper cables, output full)\n- Science assembler at (12.5, 2.5) (waiting for copper plates and gears)\n- Power poles connecting the area to power network (multiple positions)\n\n### Transport Infrastructure\n- Iron plate inserter at (6.5, 0.5) facing right (connecting furnace to gear assembler)\n- Copper plate inserter at (6.5, 4.5) facing right (output blocked)\n- Gear output inserter at (10.5, 0.5) facing left (connecting gear assembler to science assembler)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt connection errors\n- Cannot connect belts directly to furnaces or assemblers - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- When setting up transport, always place an inserter between machines and belts\n- Verify inserter directions match the desired item flow path\n\n### Production bottlenecks\n- Gear assembler is idle due to missing iron plates - check furnace output and transport\n- Science assembler is idle due to missing copper plates and gears - verify all input supply chains\n- Copper cable assembler output is full - needs output transport system\n\n### Inserter issues\n- Copper plate inserter output is blocked - ensure destination has space or transport\n- Verify all inserters have power and are properly oriented\n- Check inserter pickup/drop positions match adjacent entities\n\n### Inventory management\n- Attempted to insert iron ore without having any in inventory - verify inventory before insertion\n- Monitor fuel levels in furnaces and boilers to prevent production stoppages\n\n### Power network\n- Continue expanding power pole network as production area grows\n- Verify all new assemblers and inserters are within power coverage\n- Monitor power production vs consumption as factory expands\n\n### General tips\n- Plan complete transport chains before building (source \u2192 inserter \u2192 belt \u2192 inserter \u2192 destination)\n- Check entity status messages regularly for operational issues\n- When troubleshooting, verify each step in the production chain separately"}
