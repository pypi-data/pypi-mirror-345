{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) fueled with coal. This drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage of extracted iron ore and iron plates, located at various positions including (4.5, y=-58.5) and (5.5, y=-60.5).\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal. These furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) used for storing iron plates and iron ore.\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions such as (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), and (-8.5, y=-50.5) filled with iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a burner mining drill without having coal in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to full storage chests\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. For instance, the chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item is available in the inventory before invoking this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **coal_to_insert**: Integer representing the quantity of coal intended for insertion into a burner mining drill.\n- **iron_ore**: Integer representing the quantity of iron ore extracted or stored.\n- **iron_plate**: Integer representing the quantity of iron plates extracted or stored."}
