{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-1.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0) with status NO_FUEL and warnings ['out of fuel']\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED and warnings ['not connected to power network', 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections']\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status WORKING\n\nConnected via:\n- PipeGroup (water) from offshore pump to boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-8.5, y=23.5), ..., (x=-3.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=24.5)]\n- PipeGroup (steam) from boiler to steam engine with pipes at positions [(x=-1.5, y=22.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5), ..., (x=3.5, y=24.5), (x=4.5, y=24.5), (x=5.5, y=24.5)]\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace with fuel Inventory({'coal': 12}), status NO_INGREDIENTS, and warnings ['no ingredients to smelt']\n\n### Lab at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input {'automation-science-pack': 10}, status NO_POWER\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Attribute Access\n- Ensure that the attributes you are trying to access exist on the object. For example, `tile_dimensions` is not a valid attribute for `Prototype.Boiler.entity_class`.\n\n### Type Errors with Unsupported Operand Types\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that the operands are of compatible types. For example, converting `ModelPrivateAttr` to `float` directly is not supported.\n\n### Connection Errors Due to Missing Items\n- Before attempting to connect entities, verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory. For example, ensure you have pipes before connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Crafting and Resource Management Errors\n- Monitor your resources to ensure you have enough materials for crafting. For example, you need more wood and copper cables to craft small electric poles.\n- Keep track of fuel levels to avoid running out, as seen with the boiler running out of coal.\n\n### Connection Errors Due to Missing Entities\n- Verify the presence of entities before attempting to connect them. For example, ensure a lab exists at the specified position before trying to check its status or connect it to power."}
