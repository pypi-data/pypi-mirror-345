{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) \n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n  \n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n- **No iron ore found in the Wooden Chest**\n  - Regularly check the inventory of storage entities to ensure they contain the necessary resources before attempting to use them.\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill showing NO_FUEL**\n  - Ensure that the Burner Mining Drill has a sufficient supply of fuel before it is expected to operate.\n\n- **Burner Inserter waiting for source items**\n  - Check that the source entity (like a chest or a furnace) has items available for the inserter to pick up.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `insert_fuel(entity, fuel)`: Successfully inserts fuel into the specified entity. Ensure the entity is of the correct type and has space for fuel.\n  - `extract_items(entity, amount)`: Successfully extracts items from the specified entity if items are available. Ensure the entity has the required items before extraction.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `iron_ore: int = 266`\n  - `iron_plate: int = 120`\n  - `coal: int = 799`\n  - `wood: int = 4`\n  - `iron_gear_wheel: int = 3`"}
