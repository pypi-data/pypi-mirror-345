{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (x=1-5, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of three smelting stations:\n- Station 1: Stone furnace (x=1.0, y=1.0) with burner inserter (x=1.5, y=2.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=1.5, y=3.5)\n- Station 2: Stone furnace (x=3.0, y=1.0) with burner inserter (x=3.5, y=2.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=3.5, y=3.5)\n- Station 3: Stone furnace (not active) with burner inserter (x=5.5, y=2.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=5.5, y=3.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (x=2-4, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of two smelting stations:\n- Station 1: Stone furnace (x=2.0, y=7.0) with burner inserter (x=2.5, y=8.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=2.5, y=9.5)\n- Station 2: Stone furnace (x=4.0, y=7.0) with burner inserter (x=4.5, y=8.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=4.5, y=9.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-5.5 to 13.5, y=26.5 to 35.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=2.5, y=35.5) providing water\n- Boiler (x=7.0, y=35.5) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine (x=13.5, y=35.5) generating electricity\n- PipeGroup connecting pump to boiler (water system)\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine (steam system)\n- Extensive electricity pole network connecting power to facilities\n- Non-functional offshore pump at (x=-5.5, y=26.5)\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- Two labs connected to the power grid, actively researching logistics\n- Labs contain automation science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Water System Connection Issues\n- Ensure offshore pumps are properly connected to the pipe network\n- Check that offshore pumps are placed over water tiles\n\n### Power Distribution\n- When expanding the factory, ensure new machines are within reach of power poles\n- Maintain continuous connections in the electricity network\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner inserters and furnaces\n- Ensure consistent supply of raw materials to keep all furnaces operational\n- Consider balancing output storage capacity across production lines"}
