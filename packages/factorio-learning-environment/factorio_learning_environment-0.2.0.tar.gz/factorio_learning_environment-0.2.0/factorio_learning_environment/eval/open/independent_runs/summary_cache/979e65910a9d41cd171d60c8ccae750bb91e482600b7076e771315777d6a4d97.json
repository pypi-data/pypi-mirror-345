{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe at position (-47.5, -122.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) (Status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) (Status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n\n### Additional Structures\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) (Status: NO_POWER)\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing 227 iron plates\n- Lab with input of 12 automation-science-packs (Status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-47.5, -122.5) (Status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n- Multiple empty PipeGroups at various positions\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions (Voltage: 0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Connection Error\n- Ensure the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. Check the alignment and connection points between the offshore pump, pipes, and boiler.\n\n### Pipe Placement Error\n- Verify the presence of a pipe at the intended position before attempting to interact with it. Use the correct position coordinates to avoid exceptions related to missing entities.\n\n### Power Network Connection Error\n- Connect the steam engine and other electrical entities to the power network to ensure they receive electricity. Check for proper connections and ensure all required components are in place.\n\n### Inserter Power Error\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Verify the placement of electric poles and their connections to the inserters.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Error\n- Supply the necessary ingredients to the furnaces to enable smelting operations. Check the inventory and ensure the correct materials are available for processing."}
