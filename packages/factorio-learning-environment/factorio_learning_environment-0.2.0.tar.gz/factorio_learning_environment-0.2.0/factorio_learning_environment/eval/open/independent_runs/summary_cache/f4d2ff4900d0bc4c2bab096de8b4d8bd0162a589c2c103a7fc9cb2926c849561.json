{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with no input liquid and not connected\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) with warnings of not being connected to the power network and no input liquid\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with fluid system 1036 containing water\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) fueled by coal but with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) fueled by coal but with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to move items from the furnace to the chest\n- Small Electric Poles surrounding the inserter, but not providing power\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at an unspecified position, not receiving power and containing automation science packs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Establishing Pipe Connections\n- Ensure there are no existing objects in the way before attempting to place pipes. Check the target location for obstructions.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Verify that all components (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are on the same fluid system to ensure proper fluid flow.\n\n### Errors with Power Connections\n- Make sure all entities requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. Check connections between the steam engine and the power poles.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source to function correctly. Check the alignment and connectivity of electric poles.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Provide necessary ingredients to furnaces to avoid warnings and ensure continuous production."}
