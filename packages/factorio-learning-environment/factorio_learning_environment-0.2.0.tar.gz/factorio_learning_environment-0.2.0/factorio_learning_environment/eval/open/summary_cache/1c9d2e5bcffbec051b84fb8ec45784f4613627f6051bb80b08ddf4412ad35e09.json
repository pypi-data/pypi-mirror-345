{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron plate mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) used to smelt iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the chest\n\nThis structure forms a basic iron plate production line, converting mined iron ore into iron plates and storing them.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Errors placing burner inserter next to wooden chest\n- The burner inserter placement failed because the target tile was occupied by the wooden chest at (17.5, 73). To fix this, increase spacing when placing the inserter, change its placement direction, or adjust the reference position to avoid overlapping entities.\n\n###Inserter and machines running out of fuel\n- The burner mining drill, stone furnace, and burner inserter ran out of fuel multiple times, causing them to stop working or wait for source items. Always ensure sufficient coal is inserted into these entities to keep them operational.\n\n###Inserter waiting for source items due to empty drill output\n- The inserter was waiting for source items because the burner mining drill had no iron ore in its output inventory. This can happen if the drill is out of fuel or if the inserter is not correctly positioned to pick up ore from the drill. Verify fuel supply and inserter placement.\n\n###Errors inserting coal due to empty inventory\n- Attempts to insert coal into entities failed because the agent's inventory had no coal at that moment. Maintain a sufficient coal stockpile in the inventory before attempting to fuel machines.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent so far."}
