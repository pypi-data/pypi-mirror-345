{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: NO_FUEL\n  - Neighbors: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units available)\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (661 units)\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n  - Neighbors: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source (chest) and destination (furnace) entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring materials.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the burner mining drill and burner inserter to maintain continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Verify the inserter setup to ensure that it is transferring materials as expected. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, check the inserter's alignment and operational status.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid operation failures."}
