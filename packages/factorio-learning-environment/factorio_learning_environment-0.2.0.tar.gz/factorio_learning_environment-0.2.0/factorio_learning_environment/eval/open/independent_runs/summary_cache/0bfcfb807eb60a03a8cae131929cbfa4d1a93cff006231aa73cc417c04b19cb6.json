{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, actively producing iron plates from iron ore.\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) and another inserter at position (16.5, 0.5), both not connected to the power network, intended to move items between the furnace and a wooden chest at position (18.5, 0.5).\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (1.5, 1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 1.0) fueled with coal but not connected to any fluid source.\n- Offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) working but not properly connected to the boiler.\n- Steam engine at position (10.5, 34.5) not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups are present, with some containing water and others empty, but none effectively connecting the offshore pump to the boiler or steam engine.\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) with no significant inventory.\n- Various pipe groups and electricity poles scattered across the map, not forming a coherent system.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Connections\n- Ensure all components (boiler, steam engine, offshore pump) are correctly connected with pipes to allow fluid flow and energy generation.\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to the power network and receiving fluid input.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Check for obstructions or unplaceable terrain before attempting to place pipes.\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance when placing pipes or underground pipes.\n\n### Inventory and Crafting Errors\n- Maintain sufficient inventory of necessary components like boilers and underground pipes to avoid placement errors.\n- Ensure you have the resources required to craft items before attempting to place them.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Avoid placing entities on unplaceable terrain or where other objects might obstruct placement.\n- Re-evaluate the layout to ensure all components are correctly aligned and connected.\n\n### Entity Retrieval Errors\n- When retrieving entities, ensure the specified position contains the correct entity type to avoid exceptions."}
