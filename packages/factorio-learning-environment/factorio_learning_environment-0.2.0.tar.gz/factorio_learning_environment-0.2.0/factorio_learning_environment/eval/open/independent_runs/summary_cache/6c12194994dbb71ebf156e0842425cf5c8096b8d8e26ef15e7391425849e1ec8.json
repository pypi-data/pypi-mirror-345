{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting these entities\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions to provide electricity\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (19.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Inserter at Position (3.5, 0.5) to transfer items from the furnace\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) to transfer items from the furnace\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserters and Small Electric Poles to facilitate production and power supply\n- Wooden Chest at Position (8.5, 0.5) for storage\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of:\n- Belt Group connecting various entities, including the Assembling Machine and Furnaces\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters\n- Ensure there is no existing entity at the target position before placing a new inserter. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary.\n\n### Assertion Errors with Inserter Positions\n- Verify the expected positions of inserters before asserting. Ensure the correct setup and alignment of inserters to avoid unexpected positions.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Power\n- Connect all necessary entities to the power network using electric poles. Ensure that all inserters and assembling machines are receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for production processes. Check inventories and supply chains to maintain a steady flow of resources.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel entities like boilers and burner mining drills to maintain continuous operation."}
