You need to add an inserter that takes items from the chest and use the inserter as a source entity.\n\n### Errors with variable naming\n- Be careful with variable names. Ensure they are fully typed and defined before using them. For example, `iron_` was not defined but similar variables like `iron_pos`, `iron_power`, and `iron_drill` were available.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing an entity. When using functions like `place_entity_next_to()`, make sure to handle cases where the target position might already be occupied by another entity.\n- Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or using a different reference position when placing entities near existing structures.\n\n### Issues with power connections\n- Some entities are showing NO_POWER status.
