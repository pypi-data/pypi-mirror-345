{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-7.0,22.5)\n- **Boiler** at (-7.0,22.5) - Now with automated coal resupply system (chest at (-6.5,19.5), inserter at (-6.5,20.5))\n- **Steam engine** at (-3.5,22.5) - Producing 13,500 energy\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Water input stable\n- **Steam pipe network** - 6 pipes connecting boiler to steam engine\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Fully operational, consuming 1600 energy\n- **Storage tank** at (21.5,40.5) - Currently contains 79.7 crude oil (20.1 minutes to full)\n- **Oil pipe network** - 3 pipes connecting pumpjack to storage\n\n### New Automated Fuel System\n- **Coal chest** at (-6.5,19.5) - Contains 50 coal\n- **Coal inserter** at (-6.5,20.5) - Active, oriented Direction.UP\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Data Access Issues\n1. **Stale entity data errors** (occurred 5 times)\n   - Failed to access storage_tank.fluid_box[0] multiple times\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement entity validation before access\n     - Cache entity references properly\n     - Add error handling for stale references\n\n### Power System Failures\n2. **Fuel depletion incidents** (occurred 2 times)\n   - Boiler ran out of fuel causing cascading failures\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement automated monitoring for all fuel-dependent systems\n     - Set up alerts for critical resource levels\n     - Maintain minimum fuel buffers\n\n### Production Monitoring Gaps\n3. **Throughput fluctuation detection**\n   - Crude oil production dropped from 838.74 to 29.99/60s without immediate detection\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement automated production monitoring\n     - Set thresholds for performance alerts\n     - Create recovery procedures\n\n### Previous Recommendations Still Valid\n1. Maintain complete system documentation\n2. Implement staged activation procedures\n3. Create isolation procedures for failures\n4. Verify all connections before operation\n5. Monitor pipe network integrity\n6. Maintain backup power during expansions\n\n### New System Recommendations\n1. Expand fuel monitoring to all burner devices\n2. Implement oil production alerts\n3. Create backup power supply\n4. Develop maintenance schedules for critical systems\n5. Document all automated systems"}
