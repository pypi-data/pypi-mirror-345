{"content": "The error indicates that the crafting process for the small electric pole failed because wood is a raw resource that needs to be gathered, not crafted. Let's address this by gathering wood and then proceeding with crafting the pole.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Gather Wood**: Ensure you have enough wood in your inventory to craft the small electric pole. You need at least 2 units of wood per pole.\n\n2. **Craft the Small Electric Pole**: Once you have gathered enough wood, craft the small electric pole.\n\n3. **Place the Small Electric Pole**: After crafting, place the pole near the assembling machine to connect it to the power network.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Gather wood\n# Assuming a function `gather_resource` exists to collect wood from the environment\nwood_needed = 2\ncurrent_wood = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Wood, 0)\n\nif current_wood < wood_needed:\n    # Move to a location where wood can be gathered\n    move_to(Position(x=3.0, y=3.0))  # Example position, adjust based on map\n    gather_resource(Prototype.Wood, quantity=wood_needed - current_wood)\n    print(f\"Gathered wood to meet the requirement of {wood_needed} units.\")\n\n# Step 2: Craft the small electric pole\ncrafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nassert crafted_poles > 0, \"Failed to craft small electric pole after gathering wood.\"\n\n# Step 3: Place the small electric pole\npole_position = Position(x=4.5, y=2.5)  # Position within assembling machine's reach\nelectric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, pole_position)\n\n# Verify successful placement\nassert electric_pole, \"Failed to place the small electric pole near assembling machine.\"\nprint(\"Small electric pole placed successfully to provide power.\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n\n- **Resource Gathering**: Ensure you have a method to gather raw resources like wood, which cannot be crafted but must be collected from the environment.\n- **Inventory Management**: Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary resources before attempting to craft or place entities.\n- **Positioning**: When placing entities like electric poles, ensure they are within reach of both the power source and the target machine to establish a connection effectively.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully power the assembling machine.", "summary_range": "[1-110]"}
