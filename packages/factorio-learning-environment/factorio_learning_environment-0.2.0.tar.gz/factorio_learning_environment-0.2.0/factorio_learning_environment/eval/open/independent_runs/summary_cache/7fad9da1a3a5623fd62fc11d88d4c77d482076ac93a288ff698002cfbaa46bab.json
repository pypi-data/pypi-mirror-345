{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n  - Refueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (wooden chest) to the destination (furnace). Check the pickup and drop positions of the inserter to ensure they are correctly set.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- When placing entities like inserters, ensure there is no collision with existing entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement issues.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items (e.g., coal) are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors."}
