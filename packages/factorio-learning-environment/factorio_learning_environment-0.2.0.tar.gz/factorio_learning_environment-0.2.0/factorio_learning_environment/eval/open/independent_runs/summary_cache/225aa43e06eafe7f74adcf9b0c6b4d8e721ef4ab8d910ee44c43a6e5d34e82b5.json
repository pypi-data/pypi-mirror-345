The error \"Position object is not callable\" highlights improper usage; ensure that position data is accessed as an attribute rather than called.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Crafting Dependency Errors:\n\u2003- Before placing entities, verify that the required items (such as transport belts) are present in the inventory. Additionally, ensure all sub-ingredient dependencies (e.g., sufficient iron-plates for crafting iron-gear-wheels and transport belts) are met through proper production methods.\n\n\u2022 Connection and Path Normalisation Failures:\n\u2003- Use grid-aligned, segmented paths to connect transport belts. Errors indicating \"Not a valid path to normalise\" suggest that waypoint configurations or obstructions are preventing proper auto-connection.\n\n\u2022 Manual Placement and Buildability Conflicts:\n\u2003- Confirm that target tiles are buildable for the intended belt orientation before manual placement. Repeated \"not buildable\" messages necessitate re-assessing the route or clearing obstructions.\n\n\u2022 Candidate Tile Selection and Local Vicinity Checks:\n\u2003- When searching for buildable tiles near extraction sources, if all nearby candidates are unbuildable, consider expanding the search area or clearing interference before attempting the connection.\n\n\u2022 Consistent Corridor Reassessment:\n\u2003- Given multiple re-routing failures, re-evaluate corridor selection to avoid congested or inherently unbuildable areas, ensuring that endpoints and intermediate segments can consistently accept transport belt placement."}
