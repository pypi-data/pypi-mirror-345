{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), extracting coal with a capacity of 20000 units.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5), waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5), currently empty.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5), storing 195 units of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5), transferring coal to a wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5), storing 161 units of coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transporting coal with an inventory of 8 units.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), fueled by coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0), fueled by coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the connectivity and availability of resources in the source entity to avoid waiting status."}
