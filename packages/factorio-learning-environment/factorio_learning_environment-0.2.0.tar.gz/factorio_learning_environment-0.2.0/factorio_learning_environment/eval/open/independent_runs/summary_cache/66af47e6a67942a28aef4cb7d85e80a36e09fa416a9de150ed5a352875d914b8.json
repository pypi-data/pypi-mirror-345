{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1** at position (0.0, 0.0) and **Furnace 2** at position (2.0, 0.0)\n  - Both furnaces are fueled by coal and are currently working, converting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)\n  - This drill is fueled and operational, extracting coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5)\n  - Positioned to transfer coal from a wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) to another wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -80.5)\n  - Transfers coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (41.5, -79.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (40.5, -83.5), (42.5, -83.5), (46.5, -83.5), and (41.5, -79.5)\n  - Used for storing coal.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting positions (42.5, -83.5) to (45.5, -83.5)\n  - Transports coal between chests and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity to confirm it contains the necessary items.\n\n### Efficient Refueling\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and furnaces to maintain continuous operation and avoid production halts.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of the inventory levels in chests and furnaces to prevent bottlenecks in production and ensure smooth operation of the facility."}
