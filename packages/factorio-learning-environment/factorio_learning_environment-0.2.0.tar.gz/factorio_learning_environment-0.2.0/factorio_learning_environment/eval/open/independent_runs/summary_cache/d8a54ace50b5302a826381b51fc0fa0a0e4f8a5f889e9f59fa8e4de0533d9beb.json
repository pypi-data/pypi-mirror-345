{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the next processing stage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (60.5, -52.5) feeding fuel into the stone furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (63.5, -52.5) transferring iron plates to the next stage or storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Placement and Repositioning\n- Verify the correct positioning of inserters and other entities before attempting to use them. Repeated repositioning may indicate an initial placement error.\n\n### Errors When Entities Are Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like burner inserters and mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production processes."}
