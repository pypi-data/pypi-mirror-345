{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. Although the agent made several attempts to craft and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), none of these efforts resulted in a placed Lab. The operations involving smelting used pre\u2010existing furnaces (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron plates and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plates), but no fresh structures have been added by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Consistency\n\u2003- When calling get_entities, use the correct signature. Avoid supplying unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \"radius\") or an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n\u2003- Validate the return value of get_entities before iterating (fallback to an empty list if None is returned).\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n\u2003- Verify lab availability in inventory before attempting placement to prevent errors like \u201cNo lab in inventory.\u201d\n\u2003- Ensure that variables expected to hold collections (such as retrieved lab entities) are not None to avoid iteration errors.\n\u2003- Check that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are sufficiently available before initiating lab crafting procedures.\n\n\u2022 Resource and Production Chain Management\n\u2003- Prior to crafting, confirm that the complete production chain is online (i.e. enough raw resources and intermediary products like iron plates and copper plates) to meet the lab\u2019s recipe requirements.\n\u2003- Reassess inventory levels and resource inputs to avoid repetitive crafting failures due to missing ingredients."}
