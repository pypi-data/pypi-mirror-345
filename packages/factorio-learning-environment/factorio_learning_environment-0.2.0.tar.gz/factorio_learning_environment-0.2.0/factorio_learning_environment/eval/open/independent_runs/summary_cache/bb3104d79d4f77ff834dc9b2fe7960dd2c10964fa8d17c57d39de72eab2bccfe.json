Check the fuel status and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for space in destination\n- Make sure that the destination entity has enough space to receive items before inserting. Monitor the inventory levels of the destination entities.\n\n### Errors when extracting from a chest without checking inventory\n- Always check the inventory of the source entity (e.g., Wooden Chest) to ensure there are enough items to extract before performing the extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check the status of nearby entities to avoid conflicts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int (total amount of coal in various inventories)\n- `burner-mining-drill-status`: EntityStatus (status of the burner mining drill)\n- `burner-inserter-status`: EntityStatus (status of the burner inserters)\n- `stone-furnace-status`: EntityStatus (status of the stone furnace)"}
