{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5) and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) which is working and connected to a pipe system.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with coal as fuel and producing copper plates.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) which is currently out of fuel.\n- Additional furnaces and wooden chests at various positions storing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the offshore pump and steam engine are within a reasonable distance for pipe connections. Check the positions and adjust accordingly.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into steam engine\n- Verify that the steam engine is ready to accept coal. It may not have space or may not accept the item type. Check the status of the steam engine before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all necessary variables and libraries are properly defined before usage to avoid NameError. Review the code for any missing definitions or imports.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
