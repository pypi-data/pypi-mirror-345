{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5): Collects iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5): Stores iron plates produced by the furnace.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Inserter and Chest Capacity\n- **Issue**: The burner inserter at (x=3.5, y=-61.5) is waiting for source items, and the chest at (x=4.5, y=-61.5) is full.\n  - **Tip**: Ensure the chest has space for items before transferring. Consider adding more chests or automating item movement to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n#### Idle Furnace Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- **Issue**: The stone furnace at (x=6.0, y=-63.0) is idle because it has no ingredients to smelt.\n  - **Tip**: Ensure a steady supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore) is delivered to the furnace. Use additional inserters or belts to automate the process.\n\n#### Repeated Extraction and Addition of Items\n- **Issue**: The agent repeatedly extracts and adds iron ore and plates without optimizing the process.\n  - **Tip**: Automate the extraction and addition of items using inserters and belts to reduce manual intervention and improve efficiency.\n\n#### Coal Management\n- **Issue**: The agent manually adds coal to the drill, inserter, and furnace.\n  - **Tip**: Use burner inserters or automate coal delivery to ensure continuous operation of the mining and smelting setup."}
