{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5) and electric poles (positions 54.5, 54.5 and 52.5, 49.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (1, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 1.0, 1.0) and a furnace (position 1.0, 1.0).\n- Burner mining drill (position 10.0, 1.0) and a furnace (position 10.0, 1.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position 8.5, 1.5) and inserter (position 7.5, 1.5) that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position 1.0, 1.0 to the assembling machine at position 8.5, 1.5.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new electric poles\n- Ensure the target position is clear before attempting to place an electric pole. Remove any existing entities blocking the placement.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Verify that the steam engine is ready to accept coal and has available space before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors when removing blocking entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to remove is not causing an error due to missing attributes. Check the entity type and its properties before attempting removal.\n\n### Errors when finding nearby entities\n- Make sure to check for nearby entities that can accept coal before attempting to insert it. If none are available, consider relocating the steam engine or adding more entities that can accept coal.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. If the tile is occupied, remove the existing entity first."}
