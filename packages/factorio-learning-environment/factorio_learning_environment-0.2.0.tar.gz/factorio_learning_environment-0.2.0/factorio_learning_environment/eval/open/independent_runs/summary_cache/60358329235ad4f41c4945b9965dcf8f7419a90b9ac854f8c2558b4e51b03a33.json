{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided logs.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) storing coal (overflow storage)\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for primary coal collection\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from wooden chest to belt\n  - Second inserter at (43.5, -81.5) moving coal from belt to furnace\n\n### Furnace Setup (around x=45-47, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Transport System\n- Belt group running from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5)\n- Additional belt at (43.5, -80.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Multiple attempts failed to place burner-inserters due to existing objects in the way\n   - Always check if target location is clear before attempting to place entities\n   - Consider using get_entity_at_position() to verify space availability\n\n2. Transport Belt Issues\n   - Transport belt blocking caused inserter to wait for space\n   - Ensure proper belt flow and item consumption at the end of belt lines\n   - Consider adding more storage or processing capacity when belts get blocked\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  - Failures: Attempts to place entities in occupied spaces\n  - Success: Successfully places entities when space is available\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- belt: TransportBelt\n- drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- furnace: Furnace"}
