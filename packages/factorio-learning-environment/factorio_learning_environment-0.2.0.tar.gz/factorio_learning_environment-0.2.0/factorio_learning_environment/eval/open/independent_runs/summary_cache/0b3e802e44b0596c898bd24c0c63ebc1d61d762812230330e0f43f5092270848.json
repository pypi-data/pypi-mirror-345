{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 26.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (5.5, 26.5), connected to multiple electric poles for power distribution.\n- **Boiler** at position (-3.5, 26.0), currently out of fuel, connected to the steam engine via pipes.\n- **Offshore Pump** at positions (-7.5, 25.5) and (-11.5, 26.5), providing water to the boiler through a network of pipes.\n- **Pipe Network** connecting the offshore pumps to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine, facilitating the flow of water and steam.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Water Pipe Network**: Connects offshore pumps to the boiler. Includes pipes at positions such as (-8.5, 24.5), (-7.5, 24.5), and (-6.5, 24.5).\n- **Steam Pipe Network**: Connects the boiler to the steam engine, ensuring steam flow for electricity generation.\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\n- **Electric Poles**: Positioned at various coordinates such as (5.5, 24.5), (16.14, 17.38), (19.5, 16.5), and others, forming a network to distribute electricity generated by the steam engine.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Non-Subscriptable Objects\n- Ensure that objects like `ElectricityGroup` are used correctly and are not treated as subscriptable types. Consider reviewing the data structure and accessing methods.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to refuel or insert items, verify that the necessary resources (e.g., coal) are available in the inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors with Entity Connection\n- Check for placement blockages before attempting to connect entities like pipes. Ensure that the path is clear and that there are no obstructions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **get_connection_amount**: Used to determine the connection requirements between entities. Ensure that the correct types are passed to avoid type errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **connection_needed**: Type unknown due to error, intended to store the number of connections required between steam engine and electric poles.\n- **pipes**: Type unknown due to error, intended to store pipe connections between entities.\n\nThe report highlights the current structures and errors encountered, providing insights into the agent's operations and areas for improvement."}
