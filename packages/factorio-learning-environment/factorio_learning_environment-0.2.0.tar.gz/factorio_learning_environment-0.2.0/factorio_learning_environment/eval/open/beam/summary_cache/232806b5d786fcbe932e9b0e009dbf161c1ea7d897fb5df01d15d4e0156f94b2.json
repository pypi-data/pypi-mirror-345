{"content": "I see the issue now. Let's revise our approach to handle the placement and movement constraints better:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Find iron ore patch\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Found iron ore at {iron_pos}\")\n\n# Get existing furnaces nearby\nfurnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nprint(f\"Found {len(furnaces)} furnaces\")\n\nif furnaces:\n    # Use closest existing furnace\n    furnace = furnaces[0]\n    print(f\"Using existing furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    \n    # Move to furnace\n    move_to(furnace.position)\n    print(f\"Moved to furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    \n    # Insert coal and iron ore\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=10)\n    print(\"Added fuel and ore to furnace\")\n    \n    # Wait for smelting\n    print(\"Waiting for smelting...\")\n    sleep(10)\n    \n    # Check furnace contents\n    furnace_contents = inspect_inventory(furnace)\n    print(f\"Furnace contents: {furnace_contents}\")\n    \n    # Extract iron plates if available\n    if Prototype.IronPlate in furnace_contents:\n        plates = furnace_contents[Prototype.IronPlate]\n        if plates > 0:\n            extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, quantity=plates)\n            print(f\"Extracted {plates} iron plates\")\nelse:\n    # Need to place a new furnace\n    # First move near iron ore\n    move_to(iron_pos)\n    print(f\"Moved to iron ore at {iron_pos}\")\n    \n    # Place furnace nearby\n    furnace_pos = Position(x=iron_pos.x + 2, y=iron_pos.y)\n    furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_pos)\n    print(f\"Placed new furnace at {furnace_pos}\")\n    \n    # Add fuel and ore\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=10)\n    print(\"Added fuel and ore to furnace\")\n    \n    # Wait for smelting\n    print(\"Waiting for smelting...\")\n    sleep(10)\n\n# Check our updated inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Try to craft iron gear wheels first (if needed for burner mining drill)\ntry:\n    craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=3)\n    print(\"Crafted iron gear wheels\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Could not craft iron gear wheels: {e}\")\n\n# Now try to craft the burner mining drill\ntry:\n    craft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\n    print(\"Crafted burner mining drill\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Could not craft burner mining drill: {e}\")\n\n# Final inventory check\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {final_inventory}\")\n```\n\nThis revised approach:\n1. Checks for existing furnaces first\n2. Uses an existing furnace if available\n3. Only tries to place a new furnace if none exist\n4. Handles movement constraints better\n5. Adds error handling for crafting attempts\n6. Tries to craft iron gear wheels first (if needed for the burner mining drill)\n\nLet's see if this works better with the game's constraints.", "summary_range": "[1-2336]"}
