{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) supplying iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-20.0, y=-70.0), (x=-18.0, y=-70.0), (x=-19.0, y=-65.0), and (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-20.5, y=-66.5), (x=-17.5, y=-64.5), and (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) for transferring materials between entities.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-12.5, y=-54.5), (x=-16.5, y=-64.5), (x=-23.5, y=-69.5), and (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) for storing raw materials and finished products.\n- **Belt Groups** connecting the mining drill to furnaces and chests, facilitating the movement of iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) storing extracted copper ore.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with warnings of full output, indicating a need for better management of output flow.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=3.5, y=0.5) for general storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors Related to Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function properly. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady supply of resources to the inserters."}
