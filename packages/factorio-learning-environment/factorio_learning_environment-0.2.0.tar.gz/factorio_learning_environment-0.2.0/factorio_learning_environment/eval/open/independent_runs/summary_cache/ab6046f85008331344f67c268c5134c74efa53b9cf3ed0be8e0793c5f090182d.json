{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (4.5, -9.5) transporting water\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (10.5, -10.5), (18.5, -15.5), and (21.5, -14.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Lab at an unspecified position, missing science packs\n- Wooden Chest at position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position (-3.5, 1.5), waiting for source items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between entities. The connection attempt between the offshore pump and the boiler failed due to misalignment or incorrect positioning. Double-check the positions and directions of pipes before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Inserters require a source item to function. Ensure that the inserter at position (-3.5, 1.5) has access to source items to avoid the \"waiting for source items\" status."}
