{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)  \n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5)  \n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-16.5, -44.5)  \n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -44.5)  \n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -44.5)  \n\nThis setup is used for mining coal and storing it in a chest for further use.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear and buildable before attempting to place entities like transport belts or wooden chests.  \n- Common problematic positions: (-17.5, -44.5), (-18.5, -44.5), (-16.5, -45.5), (-16.5, -46.5).  \n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Always define variables like `transport_belt` and `chest` before using them in conditional statements.  \n- Example: `if transport_belt:` and `if transport_belt and chest:` caused `NameError` because `transport_belt` was not defined.  \n\n#### Repeated placement attempts\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to place entities in the same non-buildable positions. Check the tile status once and adjust the placement logic accordingly.  \n\n#### General placement tips\n- Use the game's buildable area checks to ensure tiles are valid before placing entities.  \n- Plan entity placements to avoid overlapping or obstructing existing structures."}
