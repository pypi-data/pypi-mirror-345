{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with the following attributes:\n  - Fuel: Inventory containing 50 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt, furnace fuel source is full\n  - Current output: 21 iron plates\n\n### Pipe Group\n- Located at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n- Status: Empty\n- Consists of pipes connecting the following positions:\n  - (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=23.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Group\n- Consists of electric poles at various positions:\n  - (x=-7.5, y=19.5)\n  - (x=-7.5, y=18.5)\n  - (x=-3.5, y=18.5)\n  - (x=1.5, y=20.5)\n  - (x=-8.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-3.5, y=22.5)\n- Voltage: 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when finding suitable positions for offshore pumps\n- Ensure that the position selected for placing an offshore pump is adjacent to a water source. The agent repeatedly failed to find a suitable position for the offshore pump.\n\n### Errors when placing boilers\n- Verify that the selected position for placing a boiler is suitable and unoccupied. The agent attempted to place a boiler at an unsuitable position multiple times.\n- Ensure the correct use of the 'Position' object when placing entities to avoid errors such as \"'Position' object is not callable\"."}
