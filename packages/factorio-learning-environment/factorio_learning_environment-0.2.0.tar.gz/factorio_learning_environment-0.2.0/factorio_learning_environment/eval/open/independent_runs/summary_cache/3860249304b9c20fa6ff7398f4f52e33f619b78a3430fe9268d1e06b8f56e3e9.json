{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation System at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=5.5, y=21.5) connected to small electric poles and pipes.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0) fueled with coal, connected to pipes and steam output.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine, facilitating water and steam flow.\n- **ElectricityGroup** with small electric poles at various positions providing electrical connectivity.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) used for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Research Facility at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Lab** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) conducting Automation research, connected to the electricity network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are required for crafting copper cables and small electric poles, respectively.\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes and Steam Engine\n- Verify the connectivity of pipes between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Ensure all necessary pipes are placed correctly to facilitate the flow of water and steam.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Double-check the positions and existence of entities like labs before attempting operations. Ensure that the entities are correctly placed and referenced in the code.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Steam Engine Status\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected and fueled to maintain its working status. Regularly check the fuel levels and connectivity to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### NameError in Code\n- Verify the variable names and ensure they are defined before use. For instance, ensure that 'Lab' and 'copper_cable_needed_for_poles' are correctly defined and referenced.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of coal to refuel boilers and ensure continuous operation of the steam engine. Regularly harvest coal to avoid running out.\n\n### Lab Status and Research Errors\n- Ensure that the lab is correctly connected to the power grid and has the necessary science packs to conduct research. Check the lab's status regularly to avoid errors."}
