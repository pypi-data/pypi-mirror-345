{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore, currently containing 240 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It has been repositioned multiple times to ensure proper alignment.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues with inserters.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5): Positioned to transfer items into the stone furnace, but currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with their source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items, as seen with the inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) which was repositioned multiple times.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the setup of inserters feeding into furnaces. If a furnace is not receiving ore, check the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly set.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Refueling\n- Before attempting to refuel entities, ensure that the required fuel (e.g., coal) is available in your inventory. An error occurred when trying to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Efficient Refueling Practices\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. This prevents interruptions in resource processing.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the efficiency of the resource processing and smelting operations can be significantly improved."}
