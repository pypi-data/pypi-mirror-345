{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0) smelting copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates to storage\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (-23, -58)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-22.5, -56.5) moving plates to storage\n- Wooden chest at (-22.5, -55.5) storing iron plates\n- Burner inserter at (-20.5, -59.5) for input\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), and (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Multiple wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) for ore storage\n- Multiple burner inserters for material movement\n- Transport belt network connecting components\n\n### Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5)\n- Output inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- Input storage chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output storage chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check if target position is clear before placing new entities\n- Cannot place inserters where other entities already exist (like at -27.5, -59.5)\n\n### Production Line Issues\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning - ensure proper input material flow\n- Some inserters showing \"waiting for source items\" - verify supply chain connectivity\n- Some inserters showing \"output blocked\" - ensure output paths are clear and have space\n\n### Resource Management\n- One mining drill has \"out of fuel\" warning - maintain consistent fuel supply to all machines\n- Multiple entities show \"waiting for source items\" - optimize material flow and supply chains\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Some belt groups showing \"EMPTY\" status - verify proper connection and material flow through transport systems\n- Ensure belt connections properly link production stages"}
