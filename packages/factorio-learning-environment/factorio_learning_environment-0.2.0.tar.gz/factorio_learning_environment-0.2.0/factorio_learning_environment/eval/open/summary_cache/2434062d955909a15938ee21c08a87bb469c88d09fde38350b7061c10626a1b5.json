{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore, but frequently with full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates and input chests for assembling.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, feeding chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (17.5, 72.5) newly placed, connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace output remains unresolved, causing mining drill output blockage.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, but output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (0.5, 6.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power network via small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), with burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine input inventory intermittently receives iron plates and iron gear wheels, but output chest remains empty.\n- Assembling machine reports shortage of iron plates preventing continuous crafting at times.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and output inserter setup, with iron plate input intermittently supplied but output chest not yet receiving produced items.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near steam engine and furnace at (0.5, 6.5) and (18.0, 75.0) repeatedly failed due to collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain (water).\n- To avoid these errors, verify tile occupancy and terrain type before placement.\n- Adjust placement parameters such as spacing, direction, or reference position to find valid placement tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters occasionally wait for source items due to empty input chests, causing temporary stoppages.\n- Maintain steady supply of input materials in chests feeding inserters to prevent waiting states.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) intermittently receives iron plates but output chest remains empty, indicating output items are not being extracted.\n- Assembling machine reports ingredient shortage errors when iron plates are insufficient.\n- Ensure continuous supply of iron plates and implement inserters or belts to extract assembled iron gear wheels from output chest to prevent output blockage.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" preventing output flow.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, blocking further smelting.\n- Power network connectivity improved with additional poles, including one at (17.5, 72.5) and (25.5, 80.5).\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items.\n- Monitor furnace output and chest inventories to maintain smooth throughput.\n\n### Extraction errors from empty chests\n- Extraction attempts from wooden"}
