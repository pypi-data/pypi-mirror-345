{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (9997 units remaining)\n  - Warning: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: NORMAL\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (34 units), Iron Plate (22 units)\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Neighbours:\n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Warning: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all entities that require it, such as mining drills, furnaces, and inserters. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors from Full Inventory\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of chests and other storage entities to prevent them from becoming full. This will ensure that mining drills and other production entities can continue to operate without interruption.\n\n### Errors from No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has a continuous supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to process. This can be achieved by maintaining an efficient supply chain from mining drills to furnaces, possibly using inserters and belts to automate the process."}
