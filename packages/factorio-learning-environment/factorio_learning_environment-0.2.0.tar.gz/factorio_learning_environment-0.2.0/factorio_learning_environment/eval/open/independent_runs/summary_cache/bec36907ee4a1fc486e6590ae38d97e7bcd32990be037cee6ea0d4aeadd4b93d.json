Check the positions of the entities to confirm they can connect.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Verify that all power connections are established correctly and that the entities requiring power are connected to a power source. Check the status of electric poles and ensure they are within range of the entities they are meant to power."}
