{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a connected chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and operational to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check the inserter's fuel supply and positioning.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full inventory.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Keep the burner inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Out of Ingredients\n- Ensure a continuous supply of iron ore to the furnace to prevent it from running out of ingredients to smelt."}
