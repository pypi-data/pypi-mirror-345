Currently non-operational.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Offshore Pump at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - Extracts water. Status: Working.\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Pump to Boiler (Fluid System 9773, positions include (x=-8.5, y=-0.5) to (x=-4.5, y=0.5)). Status: Full Output (Water).\n    *   Boiler at (x=-5.0, y=2.5) - Consumes fuel and water to produce steam. Status: Out of Fuel.\n    *   PipeGroup intended to connect Boiler to Steam Engine (Fluid System 9775, positions include (x=-6.5, y=2.5) to (x=-2.5, y=6.5)). Status: Empty.\n    *   Steam Engine at (x=0.5, y=6.5) - Consumes steam to generate electricity. Status: Not Connected (to power network or fluid input).\n    *   Small Electric Pole at (x=0.5, y=4.5) - Part of Electricity Group 3"}
