{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -84)\nComplex automated coal mining and storage setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Three storage chests:\n  - Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing 1600 coal each\n  - One wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) acting as buffer storage\n- Transport system:\n  - Chest inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from buffer chest to belt\n  - Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) moving coal rightward\n  - Furnace inserter at (43.5, -81.5) attempting to feed furnace\n\n### Smelting Setup (around x=45-49, y=-81)\nTwo stone furnaces set up for smelting:\n- First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n- Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Output storage chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Main belt group running from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5)\n- Additional belt at (43.5, -80.5) moving materials rightward\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Inserter Placement Issues\n   - Multiple failed attempts to place inserter due to existing objects in the way\n   - Before placing inserters, ensure the target location is clear of other entities\n   - Double-check the exact coordinates for inserter placement\n\n2. Transport System Blockages\n   - Transport belt at drop position (43.5, -80.5) is getting blocked\n   - Need to ensure proper item flow by managing belt capacity and downstream consumption\n\n3. Furnace Operation Issues\n   - Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n   - Ensure proper connection between input transport system and furnace input\n   - Verify inserter orientations are correct for moving materials into furnaces\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter - Used for inserting materials into furnaces\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill - Coal mining equipment\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter - Moves items from chest to belt\n\nSystem States:\n- Mining drill: Working state with coal fuel\n- Chest inserter: Waiting for space in destination\n- Belt system: Working but with blockage issues\n- Furnace inserter: Various states (waiting for source/space)\n- Furnaces: No ingredients state"}
