{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Connected by PipeGroup (fluid system 95734) from Position (-42.5, -124.5) to various positions including (-61.5, -92.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with an Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity to avoid placement blockage. For example, failed to place a small electric pole at (8.5, -62.0) due to obstruction.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that there are no obstructions between entities when attempting to connect them. For instance, failed to connect small electric poles due to placement blockage.\n\n### Errors with function arguments\n- Ensure that function arguments are of the correct type. For example, when using `pickup_entity(entity)`, the second argument must be a Position object."}
