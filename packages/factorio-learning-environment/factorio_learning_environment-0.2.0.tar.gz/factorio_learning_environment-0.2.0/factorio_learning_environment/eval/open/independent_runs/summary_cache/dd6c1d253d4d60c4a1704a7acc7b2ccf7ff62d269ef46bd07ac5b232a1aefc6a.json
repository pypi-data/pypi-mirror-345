{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10.0, -59.0)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row with wooden chests:\n- Mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0) with chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0) with chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0) with chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are currently out of fuel but positioned over iron ore deposits\n\n### Copper Processing Setup at (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-28.5, -58.5) feeding the furnace\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates to storage\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing processed plates\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0.0, 0.0)\nFour parallel smelting lines, each consisting of:\n- Stone furnace (at 0.0/2.0/4.0/6.0, 0.0)\n- Input inserter and chest above (at x.5, -1.5 and x.5, -2.5)\n- Output inserter and chest below (at x.5, 1.5 and x.5, 2.5)\nWhere x is 0, 2, 4, and 6 respectively\n\n### Additional Storage/Processing Area at (-23.0, -58.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Multiple burner inserters for material movement\n- Storage chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing transport belts or other entities, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- Use the entity's tile dimensions to calculate proper placement positions that don't overlap with existing structures\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Mining drills are inactive due to lack of fuel - ensure consistent fuel supply to all burner mining drills\n- Some furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - establish proper input material flow\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Multiple inserters show \"waiting for source items\" status - ensure proper material flow paths are established\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended source and destination entities"}
