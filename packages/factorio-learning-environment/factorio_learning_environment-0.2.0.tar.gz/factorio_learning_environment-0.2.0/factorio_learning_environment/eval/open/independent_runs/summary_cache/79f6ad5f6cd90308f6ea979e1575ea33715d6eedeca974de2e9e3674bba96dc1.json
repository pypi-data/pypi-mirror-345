Check inventory and resource availability.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all structures requiring power are connected to a power source. Check the status of electric poles and lab power connections."}
