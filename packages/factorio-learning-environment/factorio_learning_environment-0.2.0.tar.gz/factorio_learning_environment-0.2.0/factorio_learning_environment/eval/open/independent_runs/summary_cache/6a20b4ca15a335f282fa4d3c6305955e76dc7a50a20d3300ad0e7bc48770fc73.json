Conflicting placements\u2014especially in the region near (8.5, 22.5) where burner\u2011inserters and transport belts overlap\u2014have prevented the discovery of a clear buildable area.\n\u2022 In the latest update the agent attempted to clear interference by scanning within a radius of 3 around (8.5, 22.5). Although no interfering entities were detected in that target region, a subsequent search for a buildable area near (8.5, 18.5) triggered an error, leaving the extra steam engine still unplaced.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue:\n\u2003 - When facing spatial congestion in the boiler zone, remove or reposition conflicting entities (such as burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts) near (8.5, 22.5). Alternately, redesign the adjacent connection interfaces or consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested area.\n\n\u2022 TypeError During Buildable Area Logging:\n\u2003 - The error \u201cTypeError: 'Position' object is not callable\u201d indicates that an attribute (likely the center of a bounding box) is being mistakenly invoked as a function. Review the code to access the property (e.g., use buildable_area.center without parentheses) and validate object types before calling them."}
