{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper plates as output\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with iron plates as output\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) currently inactive\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to small electric poles at positions (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently without power\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, all currently empty\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles forming an electricity network, currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n### Errors related to missing entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. For example, the error when trying to get a pipe at position (-47.5, -122.5) suggests that the pipe was removed or never existed.\n\n### Offshore Pump Not Working\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly connected to a water source and that there are no warnings such as \"no fluid present in connections.\"\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. The steam engine and inserter are not receiving power, indicating a potential issue with the electricity network setup."}
