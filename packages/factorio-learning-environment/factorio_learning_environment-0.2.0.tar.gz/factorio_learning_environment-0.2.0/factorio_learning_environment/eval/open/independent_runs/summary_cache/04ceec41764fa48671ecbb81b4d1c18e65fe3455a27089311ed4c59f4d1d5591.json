{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0): Extracts coal from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5): Stores mined coal. Connected to the burner mining drill via its drop position.\n\n#### Iron Ore Processing Setup at position (-15.0, -45.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -45.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -44.5): Feeds iron ore into the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-16.5, -44.5): Attempts to feed items into the furnace but is currently waiting for a transport belt connection.\n\n#### Inserter Network at position (-13.5, -44.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -44.5): Currently idle, waiting for items to process.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in non-buildable positions\n- **Cannot place stone furnace at x=-14.5 y=-48.5**: Ensure the target position is buildable (not water or occupied by another entity).\n- **Cannot place transport belt at x=-17.5 y=-44.5**: Verify the position is clear and buildable before attempting placement.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities without required items\n- **Failed to connect transport belt**: Ensure you have the required transport belts in your inventory before attempting to connect entities.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to existing structures\n- **Cannot place burner inserter next to furnace at x=-15.0 y=-45.0**: Check for collisions with nearby entities or non-buildable terrain. Adjust spacing or direction to avoid conflicts.\n\n#### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- **Could not get Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill at position x=-15.0 y=-50.0**: Verify the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it.\n- **Could not get Prototype.TransportBelt at position x=-17.5 y=-44.5**: Ensure the transport belt is placed and accessible before referencing it.\n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- **NameError: name 'transport_belt' is not defined**: Ensure all variables are properly defined before use in your code.\n\n#### General Tips\n- Always check inventory for required items before attempting to place or connect entities.\n- Verify entity positions and ensure they are accessible before interacting with them.\n- Use proper spacing and direction when placing entities next to existing structures to avoid collisions."}
