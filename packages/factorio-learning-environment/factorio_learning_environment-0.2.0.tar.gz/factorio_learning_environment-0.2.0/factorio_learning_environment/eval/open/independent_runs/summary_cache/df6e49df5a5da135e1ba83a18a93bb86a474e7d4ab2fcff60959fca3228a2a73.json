{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a new report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around x=41-46, y=-80)\nA coal processing setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal, facing DOWN\n- Transport belt system from (41.5, -80.5) to (43.5, -80.5), all facing RIGHT, containing 12 coal\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT, picking up from (43.5, -80.5) and dropping at (45.5, -80.5)\n- Stone furnace at (46.0, -80.0) facing UP\n\nCurrent operational status:\n- Mining drill: Waiting for space in destination\n- Belt system: Working, transporting coal\n- Inserter: Waiting for space in destination\n- Furnace: No ingredients, fuel source full (50 coal)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Alignment Issues\n- When placing entities that interact (like inserters and furnaces), ensure their input/output positions align perfectly\n- Pay attention to the exact drop positions of inserters when placing target entities\n- Consider the size of entities (furnaces are 2x2, inserters 1x1) when planning layouts\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Clear blocked transport belts to allow continuous operation\n- Monitor and manage furnace fuel levels to prevent overfilling\n\n### Code-Related Errors\n- When accessing entity dimensions (width/height), ensure proper attribute access methods are used instead of direct arithmetic operations with ModelPrivateAttr\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\nNone defined in the provided logs\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Mining drill status: EntityStatus (enum)\n- Belt system status: EntityStatus (enum)\n- Furnace status: EntityStatus (enum)\n- Inserter status: EntityStatus (enum)\n- Entity positions: Position(x: float, y: float)\n- Entity directions: Direction (enum)\n- Inventory contents: Dict[str, int]"}
