{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity group at position (x=52.5, y=49.0)\nConsists of:\n- Small electric pole at position (52.5, 49.0)\n- Small electric pole at position (52.5, 54.0)\n\n### Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe at position (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Pipe at position (-9.5, 22.5)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Chest (wooden-chest) at position (3.5, 1.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (8.5, 1.5)\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (10.0, 1.0)\n- Chest (wooden-chest) at position (3.5, 3.5)\n- Chest (wooden-chest) at position (3.5, 5.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any obstructions, including other entities or terrain that may be unplaceable (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors when attempting to get entities\n- Verify that the specified position for retrieving an entity is correct and that the entity exists at that location. If the entity is not found, check if it has been removed or is incorrectly positioned.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
