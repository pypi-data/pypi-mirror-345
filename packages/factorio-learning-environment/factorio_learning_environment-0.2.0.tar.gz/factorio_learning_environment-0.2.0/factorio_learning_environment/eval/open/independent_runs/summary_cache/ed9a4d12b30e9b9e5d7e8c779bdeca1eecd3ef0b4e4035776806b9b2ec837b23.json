Specifically, the transport belt could not be placed at position (-14.5, -54.5) due to an existing wooden chest.\n\n### NameError due to undefined class\n- Ensure all necessary classes or entities are defined before using them in the code. The error occurred when checking if an entity is an instance of the 'Chest' class, which was not defined."}
