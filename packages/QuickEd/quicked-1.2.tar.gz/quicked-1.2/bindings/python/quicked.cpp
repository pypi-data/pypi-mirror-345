QuickEd - A high-performance exact sequence alignment based on the bound-and-align paradigm
===========================================================================================

QuickEd is a high-performance exact sequence alignment based on the bound-and-align paradigm.
Currently, QuickEd focuses on DNA sequence alignment, using the edit distance (Levenshtein distance) metric.

    >>> pattern = "ACGT"
    >>> text = "ACTT"
    >>> aligner = quicked.QuickedAligner()
    >>> aligner.align(pattern, text)
    >>> score = aligner.getScore()
    >>> cigar = aligner.getCigar()

QuickEd is actually a C library, and this package is itâ€™s wrapper for Python.
Check out QuickEd's GitHub for more code examples and more details on how QuickEd works.
