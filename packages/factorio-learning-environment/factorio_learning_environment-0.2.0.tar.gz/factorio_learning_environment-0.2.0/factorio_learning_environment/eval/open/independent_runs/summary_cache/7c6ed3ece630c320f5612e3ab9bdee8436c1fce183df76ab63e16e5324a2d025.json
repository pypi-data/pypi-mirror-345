{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), which extracts coal and is currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the chest to another location.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing 43 units of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) containing 754 units of coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting the chests and inserters, facilitating coal movement, with belts running from (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a full output of iron plates, indicating a need to clear the output for continued operation.\n- Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) actively working, converting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Burner Mining Drill Running Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill is regularly refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available for inserters to pick up, preventing idle time and ensuring efficient resource transfer.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Output Being Full\n- Regularly clear the furnace output to avoid production halts and ensure continuous processing of materials.\n\nThese tips aim to optimize the agent's operations by addressing common issues observed in the execution logs."}
