{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Current Status: Working\n  - Function: Smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (0.5, -1.5)\n  - Function: Feeding coal into the furnace\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: Out of fuel\n  - Current Status: No fuel, chest at drop position is full\n  - Function: Extracting iron ore\n  - Warning: Output blocked by full chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore\n  - Function: Collecting iron ore from the mining drill\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -51.5)\n  - Function: Intended to extract items from the chest\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace or wooden chest without having them in the inventory resulted in errors.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Check the availability of all required sub-ingredients before crafting an item. For instance, crafting a burner mining drill failed due to missing stone and iron plates.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity or storage to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage and inefficiencies.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to take items from a Wooden Chest before attempting to connect belts.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to collision or invalid position\n- Ensure there is adequate space and no collision with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider adjusting spacing or direction.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, 'furnace_inserter' was not defined, leading to a NameError.\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory for connections\n- Ensure all required items are present in the inventory before attempting to connect entities, such as transport belts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Attempts to place an entity at a specified position. Ensure the entity is available in inventory and the position is valid before calling this function.\n- `craft_item`: Attempts to craft a specified item. Verify all required sub-ingredients are available before invoking this function.\n- `connect_entities`: Connects entities using transport belts or other means. Ensure all required items are in inventory and entities are compatible.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace_position: Position` - Position where the stone furnace is placed.\n- `mining_drill_position: Position` - Position where the burner mining drill is placed.\n- `inventory: dict` - Current inventory of the agent, includes items like coal, stone, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n- `chest_position: Position` - Position where the wooden chest is placed.\n- `inserter_position: Position` - Position where the burner inserter is placed."}
