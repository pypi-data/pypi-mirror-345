{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that is waiting for source items (coal).\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that is waiting for space in destination (coal).\n- Inventory contains coal and copper ore.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Status: No fuel.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Inventory contains iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Status: No ingredients (iron plate).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Status: No fuel.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from the Wooden Chest\n- Ensure there is enough Copper Ore in the Wooden Chest before attempting to extract. If the inventory is empty or below the required amount, the extraction will fail.\n\n### Errors when using burner mining drills\n- Ensure that burner mining drills are supplied with fuel to operate. They will not function if they are out of fuel.\n\n### Errors with inserters\n- Inserters may wait indefinitely if there is no space in the destination or if they are waiting for source items. Check the status of connected entities to ensure they can operate efficiently.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The agent repeatedly encountered issues with insufficient Copper Ore in the Wooden Chest. To mitigate this, ensure to monitor the inventory levels and extract from other sources as needed.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No specific utility functions have been defined or invoked.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wood`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `copper-ore`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int"}
