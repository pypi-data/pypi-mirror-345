For example, 'extra_coal_storage' was not defined, leading to a NameError. Double-check variable names and their definitions.\n\n### Incorrect Entity References\n- Ensure that the entity names used in operations are correctly defined and exist in the current context. For example, 'new_coal_storage_2' was not defined.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage inventories to prevent chests from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
