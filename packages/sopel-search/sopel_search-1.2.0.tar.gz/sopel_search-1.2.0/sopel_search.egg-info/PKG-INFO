# sopel-search

Search plugin for Sopel IRC bots

## Installing

Releases are hosted on PyPI, so after installing Sopel, all you need is `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install sopel-search
```

This plugin is designed for use with Sopel version 8.0+, but may have a higher
minimum Python version requirement than Sopel itself.

### Google query suggestions

If you want users to be able to fetch query suggestions from Google using the
`.gsuggest` command, you will need the `gsuggest` extra:

```shell
$ pip install sopel-search[gsuggest]
```

## Configuring

The easiest way to configure `sopel-search` is via Sopel's configuration
wizardâ€”simply run `sopel-plugins configure search` and enter the values for
which it prompts you. Available settings are:

* `region`: Set this to the primary geographical region of your bot's users,
  using one of the values from https://duckduckgo.com/params

  Setting this correctly may improve the relevance of both search results and
  query suggestions using `.suggest`.
* `safesearch`: Controls SafeSearch filtering of `.search` results; one of 'on',
  'moderate', and 'off'.

## Changelog

[#5]: https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel-search/pull/5


### 1.0.1

Bump DuckDuckGo library minimum version; older releases stopped working.


### 1.0.0

First release of `sopel-search`.

This new search plugin apes a lot of behaviors from Sopel's built-in `search`,
with the following notable changes:

* `.bing` is no longer available
* `.search` is an alias to `.ddg`, as `.g` was already
* Search `region` and `safesearch` level are now configurable
* `.suggest` uses DuckDuckGo; Google suggestions are still available via the
  new `.gsuggest` command (if optional extra dependencies are installed)
