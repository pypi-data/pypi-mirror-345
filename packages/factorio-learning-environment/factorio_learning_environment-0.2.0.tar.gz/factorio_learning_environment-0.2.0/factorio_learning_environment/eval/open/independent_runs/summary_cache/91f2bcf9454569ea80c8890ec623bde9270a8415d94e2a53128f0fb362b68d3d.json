{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) and a burner inserter at (-13.5, -48.5).\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** positioned at (-13.5, -48.5), (-11.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-9.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -47.5), (-5.5, -47.5), (-13.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -44.5), (-9.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), (-11.5, -43.5), and (-9.5, -43.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-12.5, -51.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-3.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), (-7.5, -47.5), and (-6.5, -47.5) for storage of iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure that all required materials are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items like iron gear wheels.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters and chests\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. If an entity already exists at the target position, remove it first.\n- Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction or reference position when placing inserters next to furnaces to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n- Ensure you have enough items in your inventory before attempting to place an inserter or chest.\n\n### Errors when connecting inserters to storage chests\n- Use an inserter to input items into a wooden chest, as belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure that there is enough fuel, such as coal, in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity, as placement is limited by distance."}
