{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-10, -59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 3 Burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), (-6, -59)\n- 3 Wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\nAll drills are operational and mining iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 4 Stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0)\n- Input system:\n  - 4 Wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5) holding coal and iron ore\n  - 4 Burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5) moving materials from chests to furnaces\n- Output system:\n  - 4 Wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5) for collecting iron plates\n  - 1 Burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) moving iron plates from furnaces to output chest\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters in occupied spaces\n- Before placing inserters, verify the target position is clear of other entities\n- The error at position (2.5, 1.0) indicates an existing entity is blocking the placement\n- Consider checking entity dimensions and ensuring adequate spacing between components when designing layouts\n\n### Furnace efficiency issues\n- One furnace has no ingredients to smelt (at position 6, 0)\n- Ensure proper input material flow to all furnaces in the production line"}
