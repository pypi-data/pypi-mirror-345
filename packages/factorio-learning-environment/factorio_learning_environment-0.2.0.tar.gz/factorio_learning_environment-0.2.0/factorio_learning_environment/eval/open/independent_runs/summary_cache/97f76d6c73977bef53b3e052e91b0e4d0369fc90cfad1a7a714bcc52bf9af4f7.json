{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt Group** connecting the wooden chest to the end chest, consisting of:\n  - Belt from (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) moving right.\n  - Belt from (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5) moving right.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to the end chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure there is enough space and the position is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with belts\n- Belts cannot be connected directly from a chest. Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a belt.\n\n### Errors due to missing inventory items\n- Verify that required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place or craft them. Gather necessary raw resources, such as wood, before crafting items that require them.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory\n- Ensure that the items you wish to insert into an entity are available in your inventory before attempting the operation."}
