{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the above entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=2.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting input and output\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- Inserters at Positions (x=3.5, y=0.5) and (x=2.5, y=1.5) for input and output\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=9.5, y=5.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=5.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mine at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts Directly from a Furnace\n- Ensure to use an inserter when connecting belts to or from a furnace. Belts cannot be directly connected to a furnace.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from inserters to prevent blockage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up to avoid waiting status.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Assembling Machine Missing Resources\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has all required resources to produce the intended product to avoid shortages."}
