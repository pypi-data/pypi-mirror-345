{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Errors\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory to refuel all necessary machines, such as mining drills and inserters, to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Functionality Issues\n- Regularly check and verify the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer materials between entities. Misalignment can lead to materials not being transferred as expected.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Materials\n- Inspect the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly configured to deliver materials to the furnace. Verify that the inserter is not waiting for source items and is properly fueled.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. Regularly extract items from chests to maintain space for incoming resources.\n\nBy addressing these errors and maintaining regular checks on fuel levels and inserter alignments, you can ensure smoother operation of your facilities."}
