{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nLocated at y=0, consists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0,0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates\n- Stone furnace at (2,0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nLocated at y=4, consists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (4,4) with coal fuel, producing copper plates  \n- Stone furnace at (6,4) with coal fuel, producing copper plates\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around y=24, consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,24.5) producing water\n- Boiler at (-2.5,24.0) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine at (4.5,24.5) generating electricity\n- Connected pipe network carrying water (system 5265) and steam (system 5266)\n\n### Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs connected to power grid (id 5728):\n- One lab containing 90 automation science packs\n- 6 additional labs in various states (some unpowered)\n- Connected by electric poles spanning coordinates from (6.5,24.5) to (18.5,10.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources Errors\n- Keep coal stocked in inventory before attempting to fuel furnaces and boilers\n- Monitor coal levels in furnaces and boiler to prevent running out of fuel\n\n### Research System Errors  \n- Check if research is actually in progress before attempting to get research progress\n- Ensure all labs are properly powered through the electricity network\n- Make sure required science packs are available before starting research\n\n### Power Distribution Issues\n- Several labs show \"NO_POWER\" status - ensure electric pole coverage reaches all labs\n- Verify connections between power generators and consumers are complete\n\n### Production Line Warnings\n- \"No ingredients to smelt\" warnings indicate furnaces need to be loaded with ore\n- Keep furnaces stocked with both fuel and ore to maintain continuous production"}
