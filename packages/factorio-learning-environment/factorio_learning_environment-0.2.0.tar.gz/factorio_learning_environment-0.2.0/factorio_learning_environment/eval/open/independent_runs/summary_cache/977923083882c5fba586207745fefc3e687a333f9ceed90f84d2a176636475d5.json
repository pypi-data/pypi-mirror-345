{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, including pipes at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and others forming a fluid system.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) storing iron ore\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) connected to a power network, facilitating the movement of materials\n- Electricity poles forming a network to power inserters\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before placing an entity. Remove any existing entities at the target position before attempting to place a new one.\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory\n- Always check the inventory for required items before attempting to place or connect entities. Craft or acquire necessary items if they are missing.\n\n### Errors with pipe connections\n- Verify that the terrain is suitable for placing pipe-to-ground connections. Avoid placing pipes where there are obstructions like water or other entities.\n\n### Boiler not connected\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to the fluid system. Check all pipe connections leading to and from the boiler to confirm they are correctly configured.\n\n### Inserters not receiving power\n- Check that inserters are connected to a powered electricity network. Ensure that all poles are connected and that there is a power source supplying electricity."}
