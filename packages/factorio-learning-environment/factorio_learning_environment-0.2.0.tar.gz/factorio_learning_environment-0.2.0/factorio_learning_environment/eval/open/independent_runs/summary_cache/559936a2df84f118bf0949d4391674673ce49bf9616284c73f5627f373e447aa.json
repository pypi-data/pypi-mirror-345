{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target location for placing entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is free from other entities or obstructions before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied locations\n- Confirm that the destination location for moving entities such as Stone Furnaces is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Verify the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by checking the map or using appropriate functions to confirm the entity's existence.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or appropriate infrastructure to accept outputs from entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage and maintain efficient production flow."}
