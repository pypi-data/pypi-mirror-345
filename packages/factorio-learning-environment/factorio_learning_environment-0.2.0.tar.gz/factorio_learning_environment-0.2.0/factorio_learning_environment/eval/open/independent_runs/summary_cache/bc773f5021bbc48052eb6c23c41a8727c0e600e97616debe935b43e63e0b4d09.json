{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (-12.5, 24.5), status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0), status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), status: NOT_CONNECTED\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0), status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5), status: NO_POWER\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5), status: NORMAL\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5), status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (0.5, 16.5), status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5), status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 23.5), status: EMPTY\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, voltage: 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Entity Connection\n- Ensure all entities are properly connected to their respective networks. For example, the steam engine and boiler need to be connected to the power network and have fluid connections.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Verify that the intended placement area for pipes is clear and suitable for the pipe type being placed. Adjust positions if necessary to avoid obstruction errors.\n\n### Errors with Unsupported Operand Types\n- When performing operations involving custom attributes or data types, ensure compatibility between operand types to avoid unsupported operand type errors.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source to avoid NO_POWER status. Check connections to nearby electric poles and ensure they are part of an active power grid.\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Status\n- Verify that boilers and steam engines are receiving the necessary inputs (fuel and water) to function correctly. Check for any warnings related to input liquid or fluid connections.\n\n### Errors with Obstructions\n- Regularly clear obstructions around key entities like pumps and pipes to ensure smooth operation and placement.\n\nBy addressing these errors and ensuring proper connections and placements, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be significantly improved."}
