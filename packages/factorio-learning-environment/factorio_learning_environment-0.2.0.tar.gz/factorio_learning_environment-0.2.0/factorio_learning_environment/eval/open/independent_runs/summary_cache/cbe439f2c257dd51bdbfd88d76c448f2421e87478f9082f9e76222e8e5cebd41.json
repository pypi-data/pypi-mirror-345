{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently working, while the boiler is also functioning with coal as fuel.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nThe lab is currently not conducting any research due to no research in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items from inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. In this case, coal was not available initially, leading to an error when trying to insert it into the boiler.\n\n### Errors when checking entity status\n- Verify that the entity is operational before asserting its status. The boiler was not functioning properly, which caused an assertion error. Check the fuel supply and ensure that the boiler has enough resources to operate.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
