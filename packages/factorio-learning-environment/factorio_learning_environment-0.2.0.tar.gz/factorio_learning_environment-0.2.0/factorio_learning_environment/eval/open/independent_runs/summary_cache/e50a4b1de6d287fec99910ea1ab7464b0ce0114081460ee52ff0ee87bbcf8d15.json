{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel: coal (14), status: working, but no ingredients to smelt.\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (2.0, 0.0)) with fuel: coal (7), status: working, but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 2.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (2.0, 2.0)) with fuel: coal (20), status: working, but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (5.5, 0.5)) with inventory containing iron plates (160).\n\n### Lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (10.5, 10.5)) with status: no power.\n\n### Small Electric Poles\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (12.5, 13.5) - Status: Not plugged into electric network.\n- Small electric pole at position (11.5, 13.5) - Status: Not plugged into electric network.\n- Small electric pole at position (10.5, 13.5) - Status: Not plugged into electric network.\n- Small electric pole at position (9.5, 13.5) - Status: Not plugged into electric network.\n- Small electric pole at position (14.5, 9.5) - Status: Not plugged into electric network.\n- Small electric pole at position (12.8, 10.8) - Status: Not plugged into electric network.\n- Small electric pole at position (12.9, 10.7) - Status: Not plugged into electric network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting lab to power\n- Ensure that small electric poles are placed in suitable locations that are not obstructed by other entities to allow for proper connections.\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure you have small electric poles in inventory before attempting to place them. Check inventory before placement to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors when trying to access attributes of objects\n- Verify that the object you are trying to access has the attributes you are referencing. In this case, ensure that you are accessing the correct properties of the electricity group object.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target location."}
