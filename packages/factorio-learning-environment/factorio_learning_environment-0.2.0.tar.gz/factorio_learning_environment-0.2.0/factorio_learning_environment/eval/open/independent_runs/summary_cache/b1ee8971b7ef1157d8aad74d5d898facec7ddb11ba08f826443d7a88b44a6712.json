{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Placement and Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that inserters are properly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Check that the pickup and drop positions are correctly set to facilitate the transfer of iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or unsuitable tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Consider adjusting the spacing or direction if the placement fails due to collisions or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Regularly check the setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly configured to transfer materials to the furnace. Misalignment or incorrect positioning can prevent the furnace from receiving necessary ingredients for smelting."}
