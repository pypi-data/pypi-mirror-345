{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0) to (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a connected chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces, have a sufficient supply of coal or other fuel types. Regularly check and refuel these entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inefficient Iron Plate Production\n- Verify that the furnace is consistently supplied with iron ore and coal. Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and operational to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Chest Overcapacity\n- Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining operation. Consider expanding storage capacity or processing materials more frequently to manage inventory effectively."}
