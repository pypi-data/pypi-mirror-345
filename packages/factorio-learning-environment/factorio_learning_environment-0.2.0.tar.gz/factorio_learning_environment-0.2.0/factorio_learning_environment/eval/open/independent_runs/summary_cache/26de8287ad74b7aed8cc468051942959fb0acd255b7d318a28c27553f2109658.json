Use a unified, validated fluid_system identifier to ensure candidate pipe groups are consistently recognized.\n\n\u2022 Repeated Unsuccessful Candidate Searches:\n   - Every connection attempt within a 15-tile radius from position (-5.5, 19.5) returned 0 candidate pipe groups. Incorporate a pre-check for candidate availability and verify the search radius covers valid candidates before initiating connection operations.\n\n\u2022 Expected Candidate Not Found:\n   - Even when an expected working candidate was specified, no matching pipe group was located. Confirm that the candidate\u2019s configuration, spatial parameters, and fluid system association are accurate before initiating connection attempts."}
