{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.23684210526315788, 2.710526315789474)\nConsists of steam engine (position not specified), boiler (position not specified), and offshore pump (position not specified). The electricity generator is currently not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0).\n- The stone furnace is currently out of ingredients.\n\n### Iron plate mine at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a stone furnace at position (5.0, 5.0).\n- The stone furnace is currently out of ingredients.\n\n### Laboratory at position(2.5, 1.5)\nConsists of a lab at position (2.5, 1.5). The lab is currently without power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to missing boiler\n- Ensure that a boiler is placed on the map before attempting to create an electricity generator.\n\n### Errors when using electricity groups not plugged into the network\n- Confirm that all electricity groups are properly connected to the electric network to avoid power issues.\n\n### Errors when entities have no ingredients\n- Check that all furnaces and other crafting entities have the necessary ingredients before attempting to operate them.\n\n### Errors when lab has no power\n- Make sure that the lab is connected to a power source to enable its functionality.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
