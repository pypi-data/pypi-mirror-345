{"content": "Ah, I see the issue now. We need to craft the burner mining drill first. Let's do this step by step:\n\n```python\n# 1. First check our inventory\nprint(f\"Starting inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# 2. Craft iron gear wheels (needed for burner mining drill)\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=5)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting gears: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# 3. Craft the burner mining drill\nrecipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\nprint(f\"Burner mining drill recipe: {recipe}\")\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, quantity=1)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting drill: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# 4. Find iron ore and place the drill\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# 5. Place and fuel the drill\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=iron_pos,\n    direction=Direction.DOWN\n)\n\nif drill:\n    # Add fuel to drill\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=10)\n    print(f\"Placed and fueled drill at: {drill.position}\")\n    \n    # Use existing transport belt\n    belt = place_entity(\n        Prototype.TransportBelt,\n        position=drill.drop_position,\n        direction=Direction.DOWN\n    )\n    \n    if belt:\n        print(f\"Placed transport belt at: {belt.position}\")\n        \n        # Place furnace at end of belt\n        furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n            Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n            reference_position=belt.position,\n            direction=Direction.DOWN,\n            spacing=1\n        )\n        \n        if furnace:\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=10)\n            print(f\"Placed and fueled furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Final entities: {get_entities()}\")\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis time we:\n1. Craft iron gear wheels first (needed for burner mining drill)\n2. Craft the burner mining drill\n3. Then proceed with placement and setup\n4. Use our existing transport belts\n5. Complete the automation setup\n\nThis should work better as we're ensuring we have all required items before attempting placement.", "summary_range": "[1-256]"}
