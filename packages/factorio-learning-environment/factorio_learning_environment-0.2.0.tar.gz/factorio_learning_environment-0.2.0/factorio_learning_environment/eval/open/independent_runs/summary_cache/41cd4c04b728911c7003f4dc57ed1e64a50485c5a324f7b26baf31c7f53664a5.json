{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n#### Additional Smelting Furnaces\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -47.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -47.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -45.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n#### Inserters for Automation\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-16.5, -44.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -44.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into furnaces without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items (e.g., iron ore) in your inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces. Repeated attempts to insert without sufficient items waste steps and cause errors.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces run out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel furnaces and mining drills with coal to avoid interruptions in production. For example, the burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) is out of fuel and not operational.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces lack ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and the required ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to operate. Multiple furnaces are currently idle due to a lack of iron ore.\n\n#### General Tips\n- Monitor the status of entities (e.g., furnaces, mining drills) to identify and resolve issues such as lack of fuel or ingredients promptly.\n- Use inserters effectively to automate item transfer between entities, reducing manual intervention and errors."}
