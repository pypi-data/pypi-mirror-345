{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Setup (around x=41, y=-82)\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Multiple storage chests:\n  - Wooden chest for immediate storage (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n  - Iron chests for additional storage (x=41.5, y=-83.5 and x=41.5, y=-84.5)\n\n### Coal Transport System (around x=43, y=-81)\n- Output inserter from wooden chest (x=42.5, y=-80.5)\n- Transport belt system:\n  - First belt (x=43.5, y=-80.5)\n  - Second belt (x=43.5, y=-81.5)\n- Furnace input inserter (x=43.5, y=-82.5)\n\n### Smelting Area (around x=45-47, y=-81)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n  - Second furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n- Iron plate storage chest (x=49.5, y=-80.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing transport belts or inserters, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Common error pattern: \"Could not find a suitable position to place [entity] at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way\"\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Multiple \"chest is full\" warnings indicate need for better chest management\n- Consider implementing chest emptying routines when they reach capacity\n- Ensure transport belts are clear to prevent \"transport belt at drop position is blocked\" warnings\n\n### Production Chain Issues\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper input material flow\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices, though currently maintaining adequate levels\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `first_belt`, `second_belt`, `third_belt`: TransportBelt\n\n### System States\n- Mining drill status: WORKING (when not blocked)\n- Chest inserter status: WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- Furnace inserter status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n- Furnace status: NO_INGREDIENTS"}
