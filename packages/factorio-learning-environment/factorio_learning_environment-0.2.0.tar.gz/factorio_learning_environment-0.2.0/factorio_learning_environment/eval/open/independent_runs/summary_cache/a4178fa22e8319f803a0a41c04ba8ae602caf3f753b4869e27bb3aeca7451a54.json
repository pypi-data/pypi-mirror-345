{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (17.5, 20.5) with energy 15000.0, connected to a pipe-to-ground at position (16.5, 17.5) and a pipe at position (17.5, 17.5).\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 23.0) with fuel inventory of 23 coal, connected to multiple pipes at positions (-0.5, 21.5), (1.5, 21.5), (0.5, 21.5), (2.5, 21.5), (3.5, 21.5), and (-0.5, 23.5).\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), connected to pipes at positions (-9.5, 23.5) and (-8.5, 23.5).\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Steam Pipe Network (Fluid System 10083) starting at position (3.5, 17.5) and extending through positions (4.5, 17.5) to (10.5, 21.5).\n- Water Pipe Network (Fluid System 10094) starting at position (-9.5, 23.5) and extending through positions (-8.5, 23.5) to (-0.5, 23.5).\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\n- Electricity Group with poles distributed across positions such as (-2.5, 17.5), (10.5, 17.5), (26.5, 17.5), (7.5, 8.5), (1.5, 6.5), and (1.5, 14.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### AttributeError in PipeGroup\n- Ensure that the `PipeGroup` object has the attribute `fluid_system` before attempting to access it. This might involve checking the initialization and assignment of attributes within the `PipeGroup` class.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipe`: int, representing the number of pipes in the inventory (197).\n- `boiler`: int, representing the number of boilers in the inventory (1).\n- `burner-mining-drill`: int, representing the number of burner mining drills in the inventory (3).\n- `offshore-pump`: int, representing the number of offshore pumps in the inventory (2).\n- `stone-furnace`: int, representing the number of stone furnaces in the inventory (4).\n- `iron-plate`: int, representing the number of iron plates in the inventory (2011).\n- `copper-cable`: int, representing the number of copper cables in the inventory (8).\n- `electronic-circuit`: int, representing the number of electronic circuits in the inventory (4)."}
