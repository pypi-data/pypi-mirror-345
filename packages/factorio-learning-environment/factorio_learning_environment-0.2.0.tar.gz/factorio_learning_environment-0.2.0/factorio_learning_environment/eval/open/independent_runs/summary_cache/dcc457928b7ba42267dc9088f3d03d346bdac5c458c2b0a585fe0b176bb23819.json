{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (incomplete) at (-9.5, -2.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -2.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Connected to pipe network (fluid system 625) extending to (3.5, -1.5)\n- **Boiler** at (3.5, 0.0) facing UP (contains 48 coal)\n  - Has unconnected input pipe at (3.5, -1.5)\n  - Steam output not connected to steam engine\n- **Steam engine** at (6.5, 0.5) facing UP\n  - Not connected to boiler output\n  - Not connected to power network\n\n### New Power Generation System at (-9.5, 19.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 19.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Connected to pipe-to-ground at (-8.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at (30.0, 30.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Not connected to water supply\n  - Steam output facing RIGHT towards steam engine\n- **Steam engine** at (33.5, 30.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Not connected to boiler output\n  - Not connected to power network\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Water supply network** (fluid system 625)\n  - Runs from offshore pump through multiple pipes to (3.5, -1.5)\n- **Secondary pipe network** (fluid system 632)\n  - Unused pipes at (1.5, -0.5) and (1.5, 0.5)\n- **New water network** (fluid system 771)\n  - Single pipe-to-ground at (-8.5, 19.5)\n- **Empty pipe networks** (fluid systems 772-773)\n  - Multiple disconnected pipes near (25.5, 20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent placement issues\n- Repeated attempts to place pipes where entities already exist (3.5, -1.5)\n  - Always check for existing entities before placement\n  - Remove existing entities if replacement is needed\n\n### Fluid connection problems\n- Failed connections between offshore pumps and boilers due to:\n  - Incorrect distance/orientation between components\n  - Blocked connection paths\n  - Attempting connections through water tiles\n- Solutions:\n  - Ensure offshore pump is placed adjacent to water\n  - Maintain proper spacing (1-3 tiles between components)\n  - Verify clear path for pipe connections\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Attempting to place boilers on water tiles\n  - Always check terrain before placement\n  - Use flat, dry land for boilers and other buildings\n\n### Connection troubleshooting\n- Failed connections due to empty pipes\n  - Verify water reaches connection points before attempting connections\n  - Check fluid system IDs match between components\n\n### Repeated error patterns\n- Multiple identical attempts to connect pipes without fixing underlying issues\n- Continuing to try connections despite clear error messages about blockages\n- Not verifying entity positions before connection attempts\n\n### New connection issues\n- Mismatched fluid types in connection attempts\n  - Verify source provides required fluid type\n  - Check target's fluid requirements before connecting\n\n### System isolation problems\n- Creating multiple disconnected power systems\n  - Focus on completing one system before starting another\n  - Verify all components are properly connected before expanding"}
