{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0) with a supply of iron ore and coal, producing iron plates.\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0) with a supply of iron ore and coal, producing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the chest to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) receiving coal from the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring coal to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) storing coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (42.5, -83.5) to (44.5, -83.5) for coal transportation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the target entity has enough space to accommodate the items being inserted. If an entity is full, items cannot be inserted, leading to errors.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
