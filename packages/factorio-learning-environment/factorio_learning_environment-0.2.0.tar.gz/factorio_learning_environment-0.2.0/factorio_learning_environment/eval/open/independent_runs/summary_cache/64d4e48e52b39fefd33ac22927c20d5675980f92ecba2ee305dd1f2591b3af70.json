{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mine at position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (43.0, -82.0) and a Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) to store the mined coal.\n\n### Furnace at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of a Furnace at position (41.0, -82.0) with a Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) nearby, potentially for fuel or output storage.\n\n### Inserter System at position (43.5, -80.5)\nConsists of a Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5), a Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) as the drop position, and a Chest at position (44.5, -81.5) as the pickup position.\n\n### Storage Area at positions (44.5, -81.5), (45.5, -80.5), and (43.5, -79.5)\nConsists of three Chests at positions (44.5, -81.5), (45.5, -80.5), and (43.5, -79.5) for storing various items.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure the chest is not full before attempting to extract items into it.\n- Verify that the entity from which you are trying to extract items has the items you are trying to extract.\n### Errors when using Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure the Burner Mining Drill has fuel to operate.\n- Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining when it is full.\n- Ensure the chest at the drop position has space to receive the mined items.\n### Errors when using Burner Inserter\n- Ensure the inserter has items to pick up from the source chest.\n- Empty the destination chest when it is full to allow the inserter to continue operating.\n### Errors when handling full chests\n- Regularly check and empty full chests to prevent operational halts in mining and inserter systems.\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that the Burner Mining Drill and other fuel-dependent entities have a sufficient fuel supply to operate continuously."}
