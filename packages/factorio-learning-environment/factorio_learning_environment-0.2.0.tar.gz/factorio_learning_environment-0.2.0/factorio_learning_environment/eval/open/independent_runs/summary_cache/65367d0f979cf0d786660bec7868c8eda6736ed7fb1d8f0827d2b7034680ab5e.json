{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0), fueled with coal, converting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from a chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5), used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), used for storing iron ore before processing.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5), used for collecting produced iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Capacity\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the furnace or any entity's inventory before attempting to insert items. This will prevent \"Inventory is full\" errors.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Without Required Items\n- Always verify that the necessary items are available in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. This will prevent errors such as \"No wooden_chest in inventory.\"\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Raw Resources\n- Gather all required raw resources before attempting to craft items. For example, wood must be gathered before crafting a wooden chest, as it is a raw resource and not craftable.\n\n### Errors When Refueling Without Required Fuel\n- Check your inventory for the required fuel before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills. This will prevent errors such as \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Inserter Errors Due to Blocked Paths\n- Ensure that inserters have clear paths to their drop positions and that there is space available in the destination entity to avoid warnings like \"inserter waiting for source items\" or \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked.\""}
