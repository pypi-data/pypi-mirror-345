{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5)\n\n#### Iron Plate Production at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 52.0, -79.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 53.5, -79.5)\n- Wooden chest (position 53.5, -78.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) before attempting to place an entity.\n\n#### Errors with inserter pickup and drop positions\n- Verify the inserter's pickup and drop positions match the expected coordinates before asserting correctness.\n\n#### Errors with furnace status\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel and ingredients before checking if it is working.\n\n#### Errors with entity retrieval\n- Confirm the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity(Prototype, position: Position)`: Places an entity of the specified prototype at the given position. Fails if the position is too far or already occupied.\n- `get_entity(Prototype, position: Position)`: Retrieves an entity of the specified prototype at the given position. Fails if no such entity exists.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `furnace: Entity`: Represents a stone furnace entity.\n- `inserter: Entity`: Represents a burner inserter entity.\n- `output_chest: Entity`: Represents a wooden chest entity used for output storage."}
