{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Connected Pipe Network for water and steam distribution\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) (currently not processing due to lack of ingredients)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0) (currently not processing due to lack of ingredients)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items between entities\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions (e.g., (-61.5, -111.5), (-57.5, -111.5), etc.) connecting various entities\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not conducting research\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities like small electric poles is clear of obstructions. Check the area before attempting to place an entity to avoid placement blockage errors.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Verify that there is a clear path between entities when attempting to connect them with small electric poles. Ensure that there are no placement blockages that could prevent successful connections.\n\n### Errors with Stale Entity Data\n- Before interacting with entities, ensure that the entity data is up-to-date to avoid stale data errors. Refresh or verify entity data if necessary."}
