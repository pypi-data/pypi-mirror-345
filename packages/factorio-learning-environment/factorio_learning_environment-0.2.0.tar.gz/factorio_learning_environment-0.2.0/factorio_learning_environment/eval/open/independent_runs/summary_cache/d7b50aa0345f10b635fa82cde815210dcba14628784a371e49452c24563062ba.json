{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is designed to produce iron plates from iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory to refuel all necessary entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly extract items from chests to prevent them from becoming full. A full chest can halt production as entities like mining drills cannot deposit more resources.\n\n### Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can cause production delays as items are not transferred efficiently.\n\n### Furnace Operation\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel and ingredients (iron ore) to smelt. A lack of either will prevent the production of iron plates. Regularly check and manage the inventory of the furnace to ensure continuous operation."}
