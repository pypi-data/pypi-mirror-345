{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) intended for smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) designed to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure that the items you wish to insert into an entity are available in your inventory before attempting the insertion.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or unsuitable tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain like water.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and operation\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can effectively transfer items between entities. Ensure inserters are properly fueled and aligned with both source and destination entities to prevent operational issues."}
