{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-14.5, 22.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (-14.5, 22.0)\n- Boiler at position (-14.5, 20.0)\n- Boiler at position (-11.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe connections between the boilers and the steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) \n- Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) and a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) and burner inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5)\n- Belt group connecting these entities for transportation of materials\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple chests at various positions for storage\n- Belt groups and burner inserters facilitating the movement of items between chests and production facilities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Steam Engines to Boilers\n- Ensure that all necessary pipes are correctly placed and connected between boilers and steam engines to facilitate the flow of steam. Verify that there are no missing connections or misplaced pipes.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Refueling\n- Always check your inventory to ensure you have enough resources, such as coal, before attempting to refuel boilers or other entities that require fuel.\n\n### Errors with Misplaced Steam Engines\n- Double-check the positioning of steam engines to ensure they are aligned correctly with the boilers and connected via pipes. Misalignment can prevent the engines from receiving steam.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests and Inserters\n- Regularly empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Ensure inserters have space to deposit items to maintain continuous operation."}
