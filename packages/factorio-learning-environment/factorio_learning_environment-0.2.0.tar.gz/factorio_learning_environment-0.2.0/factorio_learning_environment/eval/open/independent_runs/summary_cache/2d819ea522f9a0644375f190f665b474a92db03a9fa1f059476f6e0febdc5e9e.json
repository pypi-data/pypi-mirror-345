{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal and Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (40.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), and (43.5, -80.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n\n### Iron Ore and Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), and (-14.5, -45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Chests\n- Ensure that the chest contains the items you are trying to extract. If the chest is empty, extraction will fail.\n\n### Errors when Transferring to Furnaces\n- Verify that the source contains the items you intend to transfer. If the source is empty, the transfer will not occur.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity for the inserter contains items. If the source is empty, the inserter will wait indefinitely.\n\n### No Space to Extract\n- Make sure there is enough space in your inventory before attempting to extract items from a chest. If your inventory is full, extraction will fail.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Ensure that the mining drills and inserters are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation."}
