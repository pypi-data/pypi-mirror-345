{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n[No structures currently exist on the map - all previous structures have been removed/destroyed based on the latest entity data showing empty map]\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when trying to access non-existent entities\n- Always verify entity existence before attempting to access them\n- Keep track of when entities are removed from the map\n- Implement checks to handle cases where expected entities are no longer present\n- When restarting operations, first verify the current state of the map\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities without required items\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to place entities\n- Ensure you have crafted or collected necessary building materials\n- Implement inventory verification before starting construction operations\n- When planning to place structures, first ensure all required items are in inventory\n- Track inventory changes after crafting operations - items may be consumed by other actions\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities in already occupied positions\n- Before placing furnaces or other entities, verify the target position is completely free\n- Check if any entity's working area or drop position overlaps with the intended placement location\n- Consider the full tile dimensions of both existing and new entities when planning placement\n\n### Errors when trying to place inserters in invalid positions\n- When placing inserters next to mining drills, ensure the position doesn't conflict with the drill's drop position\n- Consider the tile dimensions and working area of existing entities before placing inserters\n- For mining drills, the drop position is a critical operational point and cannot be blocked by other entities\n- When placing inserters, ensure there's enough clearance from other entities' working areas\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces or drills, try increasing the spacing parameter if initial placement fails\n\n### Errors related to entity spacing and direction\n- When using place_entity_next_to, carefully consider the spacing parameter\n- If placement fails, try increasing the spacing value\n- Consider alternative directions when the desired placement direction is blocked\n- Verify that the reference position and direction combination will result in a valid placement\n\n### Errors related to inventory management and item insertion\n- Always verify required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into entities\n- Keep track of inventory contents when planning operations\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items into furnaces or other entities\n- Be aware that inventory contents can change between steps - verify inventory before each operation\n\n### Errors related to entity verification\n- Always verify entity existence at specific coordinates before attempting operations on them\n- Implement position verification before attempting to access or manipulate entities\n- Keep track of entity positions and update them if entities are removed or replaced\n- When referencing entities by position, ensure the entity still exists at that position\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Monitor fuel levels of all powered entities (mining drills, inserters, furnaces)\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available before starting a refueling operation\n- Complete refueling operations for all entities in one pass to maintain efficiency\n- Keep track of coal consumption rates to maintain continuous operation\n- Implement a systematic refueling routine to keep all entities operational\n- Verify coal is in inventory before attempting to refuel entities"}
