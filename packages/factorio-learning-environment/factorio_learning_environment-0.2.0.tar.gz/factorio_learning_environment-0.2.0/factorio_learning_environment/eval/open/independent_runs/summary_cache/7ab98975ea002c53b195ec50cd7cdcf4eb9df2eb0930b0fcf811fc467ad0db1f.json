{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a series of wooden chests for coal storage.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=41.5, y=-83.5), and (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for storing mined coal.\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=20.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=22.5, y=0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### Coal Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (x=24.5, y=0.5), (x=26.5, y=0.5), (x=28.5, y=0.5), (x=30.5, y=0.5), (x=32.5, y=0.5), (x=34.5, y=0.5), (x=36.5, y=0.5), (x=38.5, y=0.5), and (x=40.5, y=0.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Smelting and Transportation System\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and another at (x=10.0, y=0.0) for smelting operations.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5), (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), (x=8.5, y=0.5), and (x=11.5, y=0.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=2.5, y=0.5), (x=7.5, y=0.5), (x=10.5, y=1.5), and (x=12.5, y=0.5) for storing smelted products.\n- BeltGroup connecting various components for efficient transportation of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Removing Chests\n- Ensure that the correct method is used for removing chests. The error \"'Chest' object is not callable\" suggests a misuse of the API. Verify the method signature and ensure you are calling the correct function.\n\n### Errors when Managing Coal Storage\n- Before placing a wooden chest, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity. The error \"entity already exists at the target position\" indicates an attempt to place a chest where one already exists. Remove the existing entity before placing a new one.\n\n### Errors with Non-existent Entities\n- When managing coal or setting up new storage, ensure that the entity type and position are correct. The error \"No entity of type wooden-chest found at the specified position\" indicates an incorrect position or entity type. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity exists at the specified location.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserter to pick up. The status \"waiting for source items\" suggests that the inserter is idle due to a lack of items at the source position. Verify the supply chain to ensure continuous item flow."}
