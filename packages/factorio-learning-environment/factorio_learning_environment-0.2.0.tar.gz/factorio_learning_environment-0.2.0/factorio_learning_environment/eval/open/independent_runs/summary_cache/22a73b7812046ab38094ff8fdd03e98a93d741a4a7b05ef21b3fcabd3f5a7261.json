Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Check if an entity already exists at the target position before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Verify that an entity of the specified type exists at the given position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a small electric pole.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in unplaceable terrain\n- Check if the target position is on a valid terrain type (e.g., not on water) before attempting to place an entity.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drill`: BurnerMiningDrill, position of the drill\n- `furnace_pos`: Position, intended position of the furnace\n- `inserter_pos`: Position, intended position of the inserter\n- `boiler_pos`: Position, intended position of the boiler\n- `pole_pos`: Position, intended position of the pole\n- `copper_ore_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill, copper ore drill entity\n- `iron_ore_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill, iron ore drill entity\n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs."}
