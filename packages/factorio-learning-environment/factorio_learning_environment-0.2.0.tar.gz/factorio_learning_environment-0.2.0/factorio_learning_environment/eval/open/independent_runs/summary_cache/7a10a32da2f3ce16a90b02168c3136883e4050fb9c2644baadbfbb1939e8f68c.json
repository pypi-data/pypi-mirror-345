{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the chest to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) receiving coal from the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal to a chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing coal, currently full.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transporting coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source chest or mining drill.\n\n### Chest Full Error\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are part of the production line to prevent bottlenecks. A full chest will halt the inserter's operation and may stop production.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to smelt. Regularly supply them with the required ingredients to maintain production efficiency."}
