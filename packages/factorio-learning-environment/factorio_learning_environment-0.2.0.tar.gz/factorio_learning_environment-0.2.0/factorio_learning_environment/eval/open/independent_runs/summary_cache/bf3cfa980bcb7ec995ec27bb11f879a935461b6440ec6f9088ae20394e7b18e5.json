{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5), connected to a wooden chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) storing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) and another at (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), both with no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for a steady supply of iron ore.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple wooden chests positioned at (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), (x=4.5, y=-58.5), (x=-4.5, y=-52.5), (x=-5.5, y=-52.5), (x=-2.5, y=-52.5), (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), (x=-12.5, y=-50.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5).\n- Iron chests at positions (x=-3.5, y=-52.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5), and (x=-5.5, y=-50.5), storing various quantities of iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to extract items from chests. This will prevent errors such as \"Not enough space in inventory to extract iron ore from chest.\"\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Before attempting to craft items, verify that all required raw resources are available. For example, wood is a raw resource that must be gathered before crafting wooden chests, as seen in the error \"Failed to craft 5x wooden-chest because couldn't craft a required sub-ingredient for wooden-chest - wood.\"\n\n### Resource Supply Chain Management\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to avoid warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\" This can be achieved by maintaining a steady flow of raw materials to the furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the quantities of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel' in the player's inventory.\n- `position`: Tuple[float, float] - Represents the x and y coordinates of entities on the map."}
