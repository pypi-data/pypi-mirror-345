{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the wooden chest onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied\n- Ensure there is enough space before placing an entity. If an entity already exists at the intended position, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or moving the reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect belts. Belts cannot be directly connected to a chest.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to place or craft. Ensure you have the necessary resources, such as wood for crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before crafting. For example, wood must be gathered directly as it is a raw resource not craftable from other items."}
