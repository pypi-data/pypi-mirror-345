{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (41.5, -83.5), and (42.5, -83.5) for coal and iron plate storage\n\n### Iron and Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and another at (10.0, 0.0) for smelting\n- Wooden Chests at positions (2.5, 0.5), (7.5, -0.5), (7.5, 0.5), and (12.5, 0.5) for storage\n- Burner Inserters at positions (1.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), (6.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5), and (11.5, 0.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5) for item transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from chests\n- Ensure that the chest is not empty and that you have the correct permissions to extract items from it. Additionally, check if the chest is full, preventing further extraction.\n\n### Errors when crafting wooden chests\n- Make sure you have enough resources, particularly wood, to craft the desired number of wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when managing source items for inserters\n- Verify that there is a nearby entity that can accept the items the inserter is trying to transfer. Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and configured to interact with the intended entities.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the inserter's source position has the necessary items available for transfer. Check that the inserter is fueled and operational.\n\n### Errors with chest and inserter positioning\n- Verify that the chests and inserters are correctly positioned to interact with each other and the intended items. Ensure that chests are not full to allow continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with inserters running out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to ensure they remain operational. Keep a sufficient supply of fuel available for all inserters.\n\n### Errors with full chests blocking operations\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can block operations. Regularly transfer items from chests to maintain workflow."}
