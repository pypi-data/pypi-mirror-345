{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (23.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain from raw iron ore to iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore (currently out of fuel)  \n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) transferring ore from the drill to the furnace (currently out of fuel)  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates (currently out of fuel and no ingredients)  \n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine (out of fuel, output blocked)  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) crafting iron gear wheels from iron plates (not receiving electricity, no recipe set)  \n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) extracting iron gear wheels from the assembling machine (out of fuel)  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels output  \n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) providing electricity to the assembling machine and inserters (electricity connection incomplete)  \n\nThis structure remains unpowered and unfueled, causing all burner entities and the assembling machine to be non-operational. Attempts to connect electricity from the small electric pole to burner inserters have failed due to lack of poles in inventory.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to missing fuel and items in inventory  \n- Burner mining drill, burner inserters, and furnace are out of fuel, halting production. Ensure continuous insertion of coal or other fuel into all burner entities to maintain operation.  \n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into inserters and furnace failed due to empty inventory. Maintain a stockpile of coal in inventory before attempting fuel insertion.  \n- Attempts to place assembling machines, electric mining drills, and small electric poles failed due to absence in inventory. Always verify inventory contains required entities before placement.  \n\n### Errors related to electricity and power pole connections  \n- The assembling machine 2 is not receiving power because the small electric pole network is incomplete. Attempts to craft small electric poles failed due to missing raw resources (wood) and sub-components (copper cable, copper plate).  \n- Wood must be harvested before crafting poles; copper plates require smelting iron ore in furnaces, which currently lack fuel and ingredients.  \n- To resolve power issues, first secure raw resources and fuel to enable crafting of copper plates and copper cables, then craft and place small electric poles to complete the power grid.  \n\n### Errors due to blocked output and entity placement  \n- The burner inserter feeding the assembling machine output is blocked because there is no sink entity to accept the output items. Add appropriate chests or belts to receive output.  \n- Attempts to place electric mining drills failed due to lack of drills in inventory. Also ensure placement tiles are free and buildable.  \n\n### General tips to avoid repeated errors  \n- Always check and maintain sufficient inventory of fuel, raw materials, and entities before attempting insertion or placement actions.  \n- Harvest raw resources like wood and coal early to enable crafting of essential components such as poles and fuel.  \n- Establish a reliable power network by crafting and placing small electric poles connected properly to all electric machines.  \n- Use inserters to move items between furnaces, assembling machines, and belts; belts cannot directly extract from furnaces.  \n- Monitor entity statuses for warnings like \"out of fuel,\" \"no power,\" or \"output blocked\" and address these promptly to maintain factory throughput.  \n\nNAMESPACE  \nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent so far."}
