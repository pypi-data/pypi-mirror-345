{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (-18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-11.5, 26.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes. Check the area for any obstructing entities before trying to connect.\n\n### Errors when adding fuel to boiler\n- Make sure there is a nearby entity that can accept coal before attempting to add fuel to the boiler.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the specified positions contain the correct entity types before attempting to retrieve them. If the entity has been removed or was never placed, you will encounter errors.\n\n### Errors when removing entities\n- Ensure that the second argument used in the remove entity command is a valid Position object. Double-check the syntax and data types being used.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may block placement."}
