{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. The logs indicate that the agent attempted to place various entities such as Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts, but none were successfully placed due to buildability issues or other errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable terrain\n- Ensure the terrain is suitable for building before attempting to place entities. Check for obstacles or restrictions that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Verify that the target location is clear and suitable for the intended entity.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources or incorrect entity placement\n- Verify that you have the necessary resources available before attempting to place or use entities. Double-check the placement logic to ensure entities are positioned correctly and can function as intended."}
