{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in an empty map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving to a position\n- Ensure that the 'Position' object is used correctly. It should not be treated as callable or indexed incorrectly. Double-check the syntax and usage of the 'Position' object in your code.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Before attempting to place an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity. This includes checking for any existing entities or obstacles that might prevent placement.\n- Ensure that the coordinates provided for placing entities are valid and within the accessible area of the map. Avoid attempting to place entities at positions that are out of bounds or unreachable.\n\n### Errors with pathfinding\n- When moving to a new position, ensure that the pathfinding request is valid. If the path cannot be requested, verify that the start and goal positions are correctly specified and accessible.\n\nThese tips should help mitigate the errors encountered during the execution steps."}
