Multiple attempts were made to supply a Lab for Automation Science Pack research\u2014including efforts to locate, craft, and place the Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5)\u2014but none succeeded due to inventory shortages and crafting dependencies. In addition, retrieval actions have identified existing furnace entities (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used for smelting iron plates and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) used for copper plate production); however, these were referenced as part of resource processing and not as newly built structures. The current map state remains without any successfully placed structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Handling and Return Validation\n  - When calling functions such as get_entities, use the correct parameters as defined by its signature. Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n  - Before iterating over the result of an API call, confirm that the returned value is iterable to prevent errors like attempting to iterate over a None value.\n\n\u2022 Placement and Inventory Checks\n  - Verify that the required item (e.g. a Lab) is present in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n  - Ensure that placement conditions are met and that the target tile is free and valid prior to placement actions.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Dependency and Resource Management\n  - Confirm that all sub-ingredients required for complex items (such as labs) are available or producible. Errors indicated missing items in the production chains for iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables.\n  - Monitor resource counts and production capabilities (e.g. sufficient iron-plate and copper-plate production via furnaces) to satisfy the cascading ingredient requirements for crafting higher-level components.\n\n"}
