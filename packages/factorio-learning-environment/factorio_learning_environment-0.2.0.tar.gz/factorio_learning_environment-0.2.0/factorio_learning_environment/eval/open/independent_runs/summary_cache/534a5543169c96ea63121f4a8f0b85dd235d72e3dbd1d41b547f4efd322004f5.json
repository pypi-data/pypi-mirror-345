{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine at various positions including (-9.5, 24.5) to (-5.5, 24.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) fueled with coal\n- Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) fueled with coal\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole network\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Science Lab Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at an unspecified position with automation science packs\n- Inserter and small electric poles forming an electricity group with ID 56841\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connections\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity, such as labs and inserters, are properly connected to a power source. Verify that the electrical network is complete and that all poles are correctly placed to provide power.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Connections\n- When connecting pipes between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, ensure that all pipes are correctly aligned and connected. Double-check the fluid connections to ensure there are no gaps or misalignments that could prevent fluid flow.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Power Generation\n- Verify that the steam engine is receiving both water from the offshore pump and heat from the boiler. Ensure that the boiler has a sufficient fuel supply and that the entire setup is correctly connected to generate power.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters are placed within the range of power poles and are receiving electricity. Check that the inserters are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items as intended."}
