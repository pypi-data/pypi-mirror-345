{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled by coal, responsible for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) used for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) and (62.5, -52.5) also used for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, fueled by coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) and (42.5, -83.5) used for storing extracted coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any entity. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Warnings for full output in furnaces\n- Regularly empty the output of furnaces to avoid warnings such as \"furnace result is full.\" This ensures continuous operation and prevents production halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources like wood, coal, and iron plates.\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron ore and iron plates within the furnace.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities present on the map with their respective positions and statuses."}
