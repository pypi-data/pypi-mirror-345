{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and (x=-18.0, y=-70.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- A Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for iron ore storage.\n- A series of transport belts connecting the mining drill to the furnaces.\n- A Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) for transferring materials to the furnaces.\n- A Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) for storing produced iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) for copper ore storage.\n- A series of transport belts connecting the mining drill to the storage chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. In this case, make sure you have coal available before using the `insert_item` function.\n\n### Errors related to furnaces with no ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the input inventory of the furnaces regularly to avoid downtime.\n\n### Errors related to mining drills running out of fuel\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to maintain continuous operation. Monitor the fuel levels and replenish them as needed to prevent drills from stopping."}
