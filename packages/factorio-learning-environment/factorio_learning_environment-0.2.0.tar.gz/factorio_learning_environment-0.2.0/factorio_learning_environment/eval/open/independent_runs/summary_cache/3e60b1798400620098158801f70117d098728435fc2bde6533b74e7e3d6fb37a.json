{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Water Supply System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5), storage tank (position x=-6.5, y=-0.5) and pipes connecting them (PipeGroup at position x=-8.5, y=-0.5). The water supply system is attempted to be connected to the boiler (position x=21.5, y=44.0) through a complex network of pipes.\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction System at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of pumpjack (position x=17.5, y=40.5), crude oil storage tank (position x=21.5, y=40.5) and pipes connecting them (PipeGroup at position x=18.5, y=38.5). The crude oil storage tank is connected to the oil refinery through pipes (PipeGroup at position x=11.5, y=33.5).\n\n### Electricity Generation System at position(21.5, 44.0)\nConsists of boiler (position x=21.5, y=44.0), steam engine (position x=25.5, y=46.5) and pipes attempted to be connected between boiler and steam engine (PipeGroup). The steam engine is connected to the pumpjack and oil refinery through power poles (ElectricityGroup id=82318).\n\n### Oil Refinery at position(29.5, 39.5)\nConsists of oil refinery (position x=29.5, y=39.5) connected to the crude oil storage tank through pipes and to the steam engine through power poles.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or unplaceable positions\n- Ensure the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity. (Step 3)\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure entities are properly aligned and positioned to be connected with pipes. Clear potential blockages before attempting to connect entities.

(Step 9, Step 18, Step 22, Step 32)\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of entities\n- Ensure the attribute exists for the entity before attempting to access it. (Step 10)\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without fluid in the source entity\n- Ensure the source entity has fluid in it before attempting to connect it to another entity.
