{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Transfer System at position (40.5, -83.5) to (42.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with coal inventory\n- Wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5) with coal inventory\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal fuel\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal between chests\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with iron ore and coal fuel\n- Stone furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with iron ore and coal fuel\n- Wooden chest at position (61.5, -52.5) with coal inventory\n- Wooden chest at position (62.5, -53.5) with coal inventory\n- Wooden chest at position (62.5, -52.5) with coal inventory\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Ensure that the quantity specified for extraction is available in the furnace. Attempting to extract more than available or zero items will result in an error.\n- Verify that the furnace contains the item type you are trying to extract. If the furnace is empty or contains a different item, extraction will fail.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from a given entity. Ensure the entity contains the specified item and quantity before calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_plates`: Type: `int` - Stores the number of iron plates extracted from a furnace.\n- `extracted_plates_1`: Type: `int` - Stores the number of iron plates extracted from a different furnace or attempt.\n- `extracted_plates_2`: Type: `int` - Stores the number of iron plates extracted from yet another furnace or attempt."}
