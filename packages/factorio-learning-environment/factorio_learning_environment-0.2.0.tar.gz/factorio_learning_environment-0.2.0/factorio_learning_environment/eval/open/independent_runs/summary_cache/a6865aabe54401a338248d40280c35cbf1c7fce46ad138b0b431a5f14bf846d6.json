{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-9.5, y=-48.5) for inserting raw materials into the furnace.\n\n### Belt Transport System\nConsists of the following BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup 1: \n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT.\n- BeltGroup 2:\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5), direction RIGHT.\n\n### Burner Inserters\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-15.5, y=-53.5) with status \"waiting for source items\".\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-52.5) with status \"waiting for source items\".\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Ensure there is a suitable position for placing burner inserters. Check for obstructions or invalid placements before attempting to place an inserter.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts\n- Avoid connecting belts directly to a stone furnace. Use an inserter to transfer items between belts and furnaces.\n- Ensure that the path for connecting belts is valid and normalized. Verify the positions and directions before attempting connections.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Verify that the entity contains the items you wish to extract. Ensure the stone furnace is actively smelting and contains iron plates before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors with insufficient resources\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal to refuel all necessary entities. Regularly check and replenish fuel supplies to avoid operational interruptions.\n\n### Type Errors with BeltGroup\n- Avoid treating BeltGroup objects as subscriptable. Use appropriate methods to interact with BeltGroup entities."}
