{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map in these steps. Multiple recovery attempts to supply a Lab did not result in the creation or placement of a Lab, and no new production or assembling facilities were built (even though existing furnaces were referenced for smelting, none were placed by the agent).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Mismatches \u2013 When calling get_entities, ensure the arguments exactly match the function\u2019s signature. Avoid using unrecognized keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) and do not supply positional parameters if none are accepted.\n\u2022 Iteration Over Non\u2010Iterable Results \u2013 When filtering the returned entities (such as labs), add a check to verify the result is iterable (or default to an empty list) to prevent \u201cNoneType is not iterable\u201d errors.\n\u2022 Structure Placement Failures \u2013 Before attempting placement (for example, of a Lab), confirm that the required inventory item is available and that the target tile is unoccupied.\n\u2022 Crafting Chain and Resource Shortages \u2013 Verify that every sub-ingredient needed for complex items (such as labs) is producible. Errors indicated shortages in intermediary items like iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, and copper plates. Ensure that sufficient base materials are available and that proper production or smelting processes are in place before attempting crafting."}
