{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (-17.0, -52.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (-16.5, -50.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (-15.0, -51.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-17.5, -50.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the chest.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-14.5, -52.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -86.0) extracting coal.\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (43.0, -86.0) extracting coal.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (43.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n- **Transport belt** at position (41.5, -84.5) moving coal.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the belt to a chest.\n\n#### Smelting Setup at position (43.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone furnace** at position (43.0, -79.0) smelting resources.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring resources to the furnace.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (43.5, -76.5) storing smelted items.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting from empty entities\n- Ensure the entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n\n#### Errors when placing items into full chests\n- Check the inventory of the chest before attempting to place items into it. Empty the chest if it is full.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are out of fuel\n- Always ensure mining drills have sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) to operate.\n\n#### Errors when smelting furnaces lack ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) and fuel (e.g., coal) to operate.\n\n#### Errors when inserters are out of fuel\n- Ensure inserters have sufficient fuel to transfer items between entities."}
