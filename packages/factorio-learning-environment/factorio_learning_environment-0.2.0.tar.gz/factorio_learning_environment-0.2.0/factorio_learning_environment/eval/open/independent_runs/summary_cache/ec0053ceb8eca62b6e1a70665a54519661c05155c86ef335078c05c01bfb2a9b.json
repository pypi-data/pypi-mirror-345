Fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5), collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring iron plates from the stone furnace to the wooden chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from non-existent or empty chests\n- Ensure that the chest you are trying to extract from exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract.\n\n### Errors when inserting into a full inventory\n- Before inserting items into an entity, check if there is enough space to accommodate the items to avoid insertion failures.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required resources\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, gather wood before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Verify that all required sub-ingredients are available in your inventory before attempting to craft an item.
