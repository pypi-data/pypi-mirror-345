{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (15.0, 0.0) with a status indicating no ingredients to smelt, fueled by coal.\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) and another at position (16.5, 0.5), both indicating no power and waiting for source items.\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 0.5) and another at position (5.5, 0.5).\n\n### Pipe Infrastructure\nConsists of the following pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 19.5) with pipes extending to multiple positions including (-12.5, 18.5) and (-5.5, 23.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 23.5) with pipes extending to positions such as (-9.5, 23.5) and (-7.5, 24.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions including (9.5, 1.5), (17.5, -0.5), and (15.5, 2.5), currently with no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between entities like offshore pumps and boilers are correctly aligned and connected. Verify the positions and ensure there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors with undefined entities\n- Make sure that all entities such as 'mining_drill' and 'ore_chest' are correctly defined and available in the game environment before attempting to use them.\n\n### Errors with existing structures\n- Before placing new entities like small electric poles, check if the position is already occupied by an existing structure to avoid redundancy.\n\n### Errors with power infrastructure\n- Verify the presence and correct placement of steam engines and other power-generating entities to ensure the electrical network is functional and connected.\n\n### Errors with inserters and power\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly connected to a power source and that the power network is active to avoid the 'not receiving electricity' status."}
