{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring items between entities.\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5) for intermediate storage.\n- Additional Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) for item transfer.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) for transferring items into the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that the required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace or any other entity.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. If inserters are waiting, check the supply chain to ensure items are being produced and transported correctly.\n\n### Errors when Chest is Full\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage. This ensures continuous production and resource gathering."}
