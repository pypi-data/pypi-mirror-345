{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units available)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (494 units)\n  - Neighbours: Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure the inserter is properly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning indicates misalignment issues.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the setup of the inserter and ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Ensure the inserter is powered and has a clear path to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, verify that the items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Ensure that the necessary fuel (coal) is available in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters."}
