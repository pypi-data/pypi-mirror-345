{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport belt at position (21.5, 73.5) carrying iron plates away from the chest.\n\nThis structure forms a connected iron plate production line from ore extraction to plate output onto a belt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing entities due to occupied tiles\n- When placing inserters or belts next to existing entities, ensure the target tile is free. If placement fails due to an occupied tile (e.g., wooden chest or burner inserter), try increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n- Plan entity placement order and spacing carefully to avoid overlaps, as seen with initial failures placing the transport belt next to the chest and inserters.\n\n### Inserter and furnace fuel management\n- Burner inserters and furnaces require coal fuel to operate. Frequent errors occurred due to lack of coal in inventory or failure to insert coal into these entities.\n- Always ensure sufficient coal is harvested and inserted into burner inserters, furnaces, and drills to maintain continuous operation.\n- Track inventory carefully before attempting to insert fuel items to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Inserter operational states and item flow issues\n- Inserters can be in states such as WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS or WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION. These indicate upstream or downstream blockages.\n- For example, ore inserter often waits for space in the furnace, and plate inserter waits for source items.\n- Ensure that the furnace has capacity to accept ore and that downstream entities or belts have capacity to receive iron plates to prevent blocking.\n- Regularly clear or manage chest inventories to avoid full chests blocking inserters.\n\n### Item insertion errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Attempts to insert coal or iron ore failed when the inventory was empty.\n- Before insertion commands, verify inventory contents to prevent exceptions.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
