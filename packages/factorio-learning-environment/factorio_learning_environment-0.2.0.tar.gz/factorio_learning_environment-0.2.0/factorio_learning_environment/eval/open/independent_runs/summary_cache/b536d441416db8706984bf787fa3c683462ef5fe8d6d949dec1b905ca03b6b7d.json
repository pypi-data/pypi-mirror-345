{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (41.0, -85.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -83.5) transferring coal\n- Wooden chest at (43.5, -83.5) storing coal\nSystem is operational with good fuel levels\n\n### Iron Production Systems\n1. System 1 at (-6.0, -56.0):\n- Burner mining drill extracting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-3.5, -56.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-2.0, -56.0)\n- Output inserter at (-0.5, -55.5)\n- Output chest at (0.5, -55.5) containing 231 iron plates\n\n2. System 2 at (-14.0, -54.0):\n- Burner mining drill extracting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-11.5, -54.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-10.0, -54.0)\n- Output inserter at (-8.5, -53.5)\n- Output chest at (-7.5, -53.5) containing 229 iron plates\n\n3. System 3 at (-20.0, -52.0):\n- Burner mining drill extracting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-17.5, -52.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-16.0, -52.0)\n- Output inserter at (-14.5, -51.5)\n- Output chest at (-13.5, -51.5) containing 232 iron plates\n\n### Copper Production System at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining copper ore\n- Input inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-24.0, -60.0)\n- Output inserter at (-22.5, -59.5)\n- Output chest at (-21.5, -59.5)\nSystem is newly placed but not yet fully operational\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Issues\n- Ensure required entities are in inventory before attempting placement\n- Verify you have crafted necessary components before starting system construction\n\n2. Resource Management\n- Check fuel availability before attempting to fuel entities\n- Ensure proper coal supply chain for new production systems\n\n3. System Positioning\n- When placing mining systems, verify proper alignment with resource patches\n- Multiple relocations were needed for copper system - plan placement carefully initially\n\n4. Output Blocking\n- Several drills show \"output blocked\" warnings - ensure proper connection between components\n- Verify inserters can reach their drop positions\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails if entity not in inventory.\n- insert_item(prototype, target, quantity): Inserts items into target entity. Fails if items not available.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- drill_resources: List[Ingredient] - Contains information about available resources\n- entity_status: EntityStatus - Tracks working state of entities\n- inventory: Dict[str, int] - Player's current inventory"}
