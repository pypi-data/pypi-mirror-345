{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production structure at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the wooden chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n\nThis structure is fueled with coal inserted into the drill, furnace, and inserters to keep them operational. The entities are spatially arranged to allow ore extraction, smelting, and plate collection in a compact area.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter placement conflicts with existing entities\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces or chests, ensure the target tile is free of other entities. If placement fails due to an occupied tile (e.g., wooden chest blocking the inserter position), increase spacing, change the inserter\u2019s direction, or adjust the reference position to avoid overlap.\n\n### Fuel management and insertion errors\n- Always verify sufficient fuel is available in inventory before inserting into entities. Attempting to insert coal when none is available causes insertion failures.\n- Monitor entity fuel status closely; entities like furnaces and inserters require continuous fuel supply to operate. Insert coal proactively to avoid downtime.\n\n### Handling entity output blockage\n- Inserters moving items from furnaces can become blocked if the destination (e.g., chest) is full or missing. Ensure there is a valid sink entity with available inventory space to accept outputs to prevent inserter waiting or blockage warnings.\n\n### Inventory and entity availability checks before placement\n- Confirm the required entity type exists in inventory prior to placement attempts. For example, trying to place an assembling machine without having it in inventory results in placement failure.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
