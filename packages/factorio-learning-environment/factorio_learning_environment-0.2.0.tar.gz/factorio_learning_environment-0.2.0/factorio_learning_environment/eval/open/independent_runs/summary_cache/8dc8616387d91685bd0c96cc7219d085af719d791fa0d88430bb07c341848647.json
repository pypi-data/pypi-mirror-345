{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Setup (around x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal\n- Belt network connecting mining drill to storage\n\n### Iron Smelting Line (around x=45-49, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing iron plates\n- Multiple belt groups:\n  - Belt group from (41.5, -79.5) to (42.5, -80.5)\n  - Belt group from (43.5, -79.5) to (43.5, -82.5)\n  - Belt group from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Connection Errors\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly to stone furnaces - must use inserters for input/output\n- When connecting items to furnaces, ensure proper inserter placement first before attempting belt connections\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Multiple failed attempts to place inserters due to existing objects in the way at positions:\n  - (43.5, -81.5)\n  - (44.0, -81.5)\n  - (42.5, -81.0)\n  - (42.5, -81.5)\n- Before placing any entity, verify the target location and surrounding tiles are clear\n- Consider checking alternative positions if primary placement fails\n\n### Belt Placement Issues\n- Failed to place transport belt at (42.5, -80.0) due to existing entity\n- When extending belt lines, ensure the entire path is clear before attempting placement\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- furnace_inserter: Entity (Burner Inserter)\n- belt_connection: BeltGroup\n- belt: Entity (Transport Belt)\n\n### Entity Status Information\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Entity is functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Entity cannot output due to full destination\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Entity lacks required input materials\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Entity is in normal state\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: Entity (particularly belts) contains no items"}
