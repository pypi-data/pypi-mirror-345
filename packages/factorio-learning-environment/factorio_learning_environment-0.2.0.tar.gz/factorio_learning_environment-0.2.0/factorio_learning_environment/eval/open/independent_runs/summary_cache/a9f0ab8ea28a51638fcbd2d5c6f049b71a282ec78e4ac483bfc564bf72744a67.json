{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (-14, 23)\n- Burner mining drill at (-14, 23) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) storing iron ore (180 units)\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (24, -15)\n- Burner mining drill at (24, -15) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) storing coal (227 units)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing at (20, 20)\nConsists of two mining and processing lines:\n1. First line:\n- Burner mining drill at (20, 20)\n- Wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) storing copper ore (230 units)\n\n2. Second line:\n- Wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5) storing copper ore (397 units)\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving ore from chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (24, 20)\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving processed plates\n- Wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) storing copper plates (53 units)\n\n### Iron Processing Setup at (-11, 20)\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11, 20) and (-9, 20)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Fuel Management Issues\n- Monitor furnace fuel levels before attempting to insert more fuel\n- Check if furnace fuel inventory is full (50/50) before attempting to add more coal\n\n### Inserter Fuel Issues\n- Ensure inserters have fuel (coal) to operate\n- The copper ore furnace input inserter at (22.5, 20.5) has run out of fuel and needs refueling\n\n### Process Flow Issues\n- Furnaces showing NO_INGREDIENTS status need proper input setup\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with input/output requirements\n- Ensure the complete production chain (mining -> storage -> furnace -> storage) has proper connections and fuel\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor resource chest levels to prevent overflow\n- Ensure proper distribution of resources between multiple processing lines"}
