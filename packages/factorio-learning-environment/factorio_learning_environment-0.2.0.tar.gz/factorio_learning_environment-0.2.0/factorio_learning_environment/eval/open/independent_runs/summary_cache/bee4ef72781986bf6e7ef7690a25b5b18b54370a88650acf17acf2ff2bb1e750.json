{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=27.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=1.5, y=27.5) with status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=-2.5, y=25.0) with status: FULL_OUTPUT\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) with status: WORKING\n- Pipe connections between the boiler and steam engine, although currently not effectively connected as the steam engine remains not connected.\n\n#### Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace with status: NO_INGREDIENTS, containing 49 units of coal and 30 iron plates.\n\n#### Pipe Groups\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=13.5) with status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5) with status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=24.5) with status: FULL_OUTPUT, carrying water\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=27.5) with status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=0.5, y=30.5) with status: EMPTY\n\n#### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles distributed across various positions, but voltage is 0, indicating no power generation.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly connected between the boiler and steam engine to facilitate steam flow. The steam engine remains not connected, indicating a misconfiguration in the pipe setup.\n\n#### Errors with Steam Engine Status\n- The steam engine at position (x=1.5, y=27.5) is not connected. Verify that the steam engine has a proper input of steam from the boiler to function correctly.\n\n#### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Ensure that the fluid systems are correctly configured to transport fluids to the necessary entities. The steam engine is not receiving input liquid, indicating a problem in fluid transport.\n\n#### Errors with Electricity Network\n- The electricity network is not generating power. Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected and operational to supply power to the network."}
