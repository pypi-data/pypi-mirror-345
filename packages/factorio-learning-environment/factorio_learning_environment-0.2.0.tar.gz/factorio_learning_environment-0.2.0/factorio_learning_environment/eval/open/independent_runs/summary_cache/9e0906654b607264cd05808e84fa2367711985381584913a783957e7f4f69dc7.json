{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) with a chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) that is currently full.\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) which currently has no ingredients to smelt and is equipped with coal as fuel.\n- Wooden Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) containing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to full chests**: The Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is full. To avoid this, regularly check and empty chests connected to mining drills to ensure continued operation.\n  \n- **Errors when using furnaces without ingredients**: The Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) has a warning indicating that there are no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary raw materials to avoid downtime.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined yet.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Tuple[float, float] = (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - `stone_furnace_position`: Tuple[float, float] = (0.0, 0.0)\n  - `wooden_chest_position`: Tuple[float, float] = (2.5, 0.5)\n  - `iron_ore_count`: int = 3128\n  - `iron_plate_count`: int = 100\n  - `coal_count`: int = 4\n  - `wood_count`: int = 4"}
