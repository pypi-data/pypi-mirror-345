{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the Boiler to the Steam Engine with pipes at positions ranging from (-5.5, 16.5) to (-2.5, 22.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for water supply from the Offshore Pump with pipes at positions ranging from (-8.5, 23.5) to (-4.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variable Errors\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, `steam_engine_buildable_area` was not defined before use.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- Avoid using incompatible types in calculations. For instance, adding `ModelPrivateAttr` and `int` caused a `TypeError`.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting a steam engine failed due to missing iron plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Verify that the necessary items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities. For instance, placing a steam engine failed due to its absence in the inventory.\n\n### Connection Errors Due to Missing Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory to connect entities. For example, connecting pipes failed due to a lack of pipes in the inventory.\n\n### Insertion Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into other entities. For example, inserting coal into the boiler failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory."}
