{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n---------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. The agent repeatedly attempted to supply a Lab for research\u2014intended to be placed at (0.5, 2.5) for the delivery of Automation Science Packs\u2014but none of these lab placement or crafting operations succeeded. Although the agent interacted with existing smelting facilities (a furnace at (5.0, 5.0) for iron smelting and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper plate production), these were not created or configured by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n  - When calling get_entities, do not include unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u2018radius\u2019) or pass positional arguments if none are accepted. Always adhere to the expected function signature to avoid TypeError issues.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Verification\n  - Confirm that the required Lab is present in the inventory before attempting its placement. This helps prevent errors like \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d during placement operations.\n\n\u2022 Null Value Handling\n  - Before iterating over entities returned by functions (e.g., from get_entities), verify that the result is not None to avoid runtime errors caused by attempting to iterate over a NoneType.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Management\n  - Ensure that all necessary sub-ingredients are available prior to initiating Lab crafting. Recurring missing components (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) indicate that resource supply and production chains need to be verified and bolstered before reattempting complex craft operations."}
