{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41, y=-82)\nComplex system for mining and transporting coal consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Storage chest (iron) at (41.5, -83.5) holding 1600 coal\n- Intermediate wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) holding ~400 coal\n- Transport belt at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT, transfers from belt to furnace\n\n### Furnace Setup (around x=45, y=-81)\nTwo furnaces for smelting:\n- First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n- Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\nBoth furnaces are currently idle with 50 coal fuel each but no ingredients\n\n### Storage Area (x=49.5, y=-80.5)\n- Wooden chest containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Belt Network\n- Main belt group running from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5\n- Additional belts at:\n  - (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n  - (42.5, -79.5) facing DOWN\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Placement collision errors are frequent when trying to place inserters:\n  - Always check if target location is clear before placing entities\n  - Verify entity dimensions and required space before placement attempts\n  - Consider removing conflicting entities if placement is critical\n- Multiple attempts to place and remove inserters indicate poor placement strategy:\n  - Plan inserter placement carefully considering pickup and drop positions\n  - Verify inserter orientation before placement\n  - Consider the entire transport chain layout before placing individual components\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- coal_chest: Chest\n- belt: TransportBelt\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- furnace: Furnace\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: For active mining drill\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: For idle furnaces\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: For inserters waiting for items\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: For chests in regular operation"}
