{"content": "The error indicates that crafting a Boiler failed because the intermediate item, a Stone Furnace, requires stone, which is a raw resource that must be gathered. Let's address this by gathering stone and crafting the necessary Stone Furnace.\n\n### Step-by-Step Resolution:\n\n1. **Gather Stone:**\n   - Check if there is stone available in the environment or in your inventory.\n   - If not, locate a stone resource patch and mine some stone manually.\n\n2. **Craft Stone Furnace:**\n   - Once you have enough stone (typically 5 stones are needed for a Stone Furnace), craft the Stone Furnace.\n   - Use the command: `craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)`\n\n3. **Craft the Boiler:**\n   - With the Stone Furnace crafted, proceed to craft the Boiler.\n   - Use the command: `craft_item(Prototype.Boiler, 1)`\n\n4. **Continue with Infrastructure Setup:**\n   - Once the Boiler is crafted, move closer to the Offshore Pump and place the Boiler.\n   - Ensure you have enough coal to fuel the Boiler and continue with placing the Steam Engine and connecting all components.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Gather Stone\nstone_in_inventory = inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0)\nif stone_in_inventory < 5:\n    # Assume a function `mine_resource` exists to gather resources\n    mine_resource(Resource.Stone, quantity=5 - stone_in_inventory)\n    print(\"Gathered additional stone for crafting.\")\n\n# Step 2: Craft Stone Furnace\nstone_furnace_crafted = craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\nif stone_furnace_crafted:\n    print(f\"Crafted {stone_furnace_crafted} Stone Furnace.\")\n\n# Step 3: Craft Boiler\nboiler_crafted = craft_item(Prototype.Boiler, 1)\nif boiler_crafted:\n    print(f\"Successfully crafted {boiler_crafted} Boiler.\")\n\n# Step 4: Place Boiler and Continue Setup\nif inventory.get(Prototype.Boiler, 0) > 0:\n    move_to(offshore_pump.position)\n\n    potential_boiler_positions = [\n        offshore_pump_position.right(),\n        offshore_pump_position.left(),\n        offshore_pump_position.up(),\n        offshore_pump_position.down()\n    ]\n\n    boiler = None\n    for pos in potential_boiler_positions:\n        if can_place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=pos):\n            boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=pos)\n            break\n\n    if boiler:\n        print(f\"Boiler placed at: {boiler.position}\")\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=10)\n```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- Ensure you have enough stone in your inventory before attempting to craft a Stone Furnace.\n- Verify resource availability and proximity to resource patches for efficient gathering.\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal for fueling the Boiler and other machinery.", "summary_range": "[1-344]"}
