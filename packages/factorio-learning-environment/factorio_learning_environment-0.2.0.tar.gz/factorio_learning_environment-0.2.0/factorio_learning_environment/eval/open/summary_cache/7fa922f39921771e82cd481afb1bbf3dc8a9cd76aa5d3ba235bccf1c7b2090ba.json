{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and working, though furnace source inventory often full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, moving items between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace output persists, causing mining drill to wait for space.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and iron plate storage with improved inserter fueling and power connectivity, but output congestion remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel but previously fueled and working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, though boiler fuel must be maintained to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered but unable to craft due to lack of iron plates input.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) intended to feed iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), empty and ready to receive assembled items.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine input and output inventories remain empty, indicating no input materials supplied.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and inserter configuration, but requires iron plate input to function.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Multiple failed attempts to place small electric poles near steam engine (0.5, 6.5), iron ore mining area (17.5, 72.5), furnace (18.0, 75.0), and assembling machine (25.5, 80.5) due to existing poles or drills occupying target tiles.\n- To avoid these errors, always check tile occupancy before placement.\n- Consider increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or selecting alternative reference positions to find free tiles for pole placement.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Some inserters report waiting for source items, indicating empty input chests or lack of materials.\n- Maintain steady supply of coal and input materials to prevent inserter stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) remains unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates.\n- Input and output inventories of assembling machine and output chest remain empty despite iron plates being moved around input chests.\n- Ensure iron plates are correctly inserted into the assembling machine input chest and that inserters are properly positioned to feed materials into the assembler.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to wait due to \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" caused by full furnace output inventory and congested belts.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting and causing upstream blockages.\n- Power network connectivity improved with additional poles, but boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, risking power generation interruption.\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept more items.\n- Regularly refuel boiler to maintain steam power generation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have"}
