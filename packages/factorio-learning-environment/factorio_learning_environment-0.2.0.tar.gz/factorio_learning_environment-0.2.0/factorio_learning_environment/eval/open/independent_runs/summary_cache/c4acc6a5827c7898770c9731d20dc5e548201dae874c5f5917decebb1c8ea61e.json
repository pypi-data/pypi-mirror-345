Multiple recovery attempts focused on establishing a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but all placement and crafting efforts failed due to missing inventory items and ingredient shortages. Although existing furnace entities (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were referenced and used for smelting operations, these were pre\u2010existing and not constructed by the agent during these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n  - When invoking get_entities, avoid unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) and extra positional parameters. Use the function strictly according to its defined signature.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Collection Handling\n  - Before attempting to place or supply a Lab, ensure that a Lab item is present in the inventory.\n  - Verify that collections (such as the list of Labs) are not None before iterating to prevent \u201cNoneType\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Dependencies\n  - Confirm that all sub-ingredients required for Lab crafting (including iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable, copper-plate, and iron-plate) are available in sufficient quantities.\n  - Address any cascading shortages in the production chain (for instance, ensure smelting processes complete successfully to supply required plates) before reattempting Lab production."}
