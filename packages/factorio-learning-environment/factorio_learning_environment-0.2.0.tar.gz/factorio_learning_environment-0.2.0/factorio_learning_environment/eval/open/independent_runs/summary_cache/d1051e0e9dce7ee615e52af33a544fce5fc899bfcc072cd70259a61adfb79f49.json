In this case, iron-plates are required for crafting iron-gear-wheels, and the furnace must have ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Make sure to extract items from the correct entity and verify that the entity has the items available for extraction.\n\n### Errors when inserting into the furnace with no ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt before inserting items. If the furnace is empty, it cannot process the input.\n\n### Errors when crafting Iron Gear Wheels\n- The recipe for iron-gear-wheels requires iron-plates, which must be produced in a furnace. Ensure that there are enough iron-plates available before attempting to craft iron-gear-wheels.\n\n### Errors when inserting fuel into the furnace with no ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has ingredients to smelt before inserting fuel. If the furnace has no ingredients, it will not process the fuel effectively."}
