{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-11.5, 18.5)\n- Boiler at position(-11.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipes connecting these entities.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position(y1) to the assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### Lab at position(x, y)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position(x, y) which is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting the electricity generator and other structures.\n\n### Electric poles\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles that are placed but not connected properly.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing resources\n- Ensure to gather all necessary resources before attempting to craft items. For small electric poles, wood is required.\n\n### Errors when connecting power to entities\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed correctly and connected to the power network to avoid power issues with entities like the lab.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it, as overlapping can cause placement issues.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
