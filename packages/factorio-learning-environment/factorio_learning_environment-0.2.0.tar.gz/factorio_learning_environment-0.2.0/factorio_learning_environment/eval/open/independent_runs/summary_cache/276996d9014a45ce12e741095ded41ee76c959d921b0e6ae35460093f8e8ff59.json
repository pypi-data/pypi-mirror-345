{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Warning: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: {'iron-ore': 8, 'iron-plate': 5}\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Ensure Proper Fuel Supply\n- Make sure all fuel-dependent entities, such as mining drills and inserters, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Avoid Overfilling Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests.\n\n### Ensure Correct Inserter Alignment\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities efficiently.\n\n### Maintain Ingredient Supply for Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to avoid production halts."}
