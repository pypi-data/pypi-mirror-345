{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but with warnings about furnace belt at drop position being blocked.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0), fueled with coal, currently working but with full source and output inventories.\n- Wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) used for storing iron plates and receiving output from inserters.\n- Burner inserter at position (20.5, 75.5) moving iron plates from furnace to chests, fueled with coal but sometimes waiting for source items due to inventory full warnings.\n- Small electric pole at position (15.5, 75.5) connected to the power network, providing electricity to the furnace and inserter.\n- The structure faces output flow issues at the furnace and inserter, with blocked belts and full inventories causing temporary stoppages.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), fueled with coal and currently working, connected by pipes to offshore pump and steam engine.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), working and connected to boiler by pipes, generating electricity.\n- Small electric poles at (0.5, 3.5), (-4.5, -0.5), and other nearby positions forming a connected electricity network.\n- Attempts to place additional small electric poles near the steam engine failed due to existing poles occupying intended tiles.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failures to place small electric poles near the steam engine and furnace occurred because the target tiles were already occupied by existing poles.\n- To resolve this, increase spacing beyond 1, change placement direction, or select alternative reference positions to find free tiles.\n- Before placing entities, verify tile availability to avoid placement exceptions.\n\n### Inventory and inserter capacity management\n- Burner inserter at (20.5, 75.5) frequently reached full inventory capacity, causing failures when attempting to insert more coal.\n- Inserter also showed warnings about waiting for source items due to blocked furnace output and full chests.\n- To mitigate, monitor inserter inventory levels before inserting fuel or items, and ensure output chests have sufficient capacity to accept items.\n- Clearing furnace output inventories regularly helps maintain throughput and prevents blockages.\n\n### Output flow blockages and throughput limitations\n- Furnace output belts and inserter drop positions were reported as blocked, causing furnace source and result inventories to fill up and halt production.\n- Ensure that output belts and chests are properly connected and have free space to accept items.\n- Adding extra output chests (e.g., at 21.5, 77.5) helped alleviate some blockage but monitor continuously.\n\n### Crafting and inventory availability for assembling machines\n- Attempts to place assembling-machine-1 failed due to lack of the item in inventory.\n- Crafting assembling-machine-1 failed because required iron plates could not be crafted automatically; iron plates require smelting or assembling machines.\n- Ensure sufficient iron plates are available in inventory before crafting assembling machines.\n- Consider automating iron plate production further or manually stockpile required materials before crafting complex items.\n\n### Boiler fuel management and power network connectivity\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) was restarted by inserting coal multiple times, indicating fuel depletion.\n- Steam engine power network connectivity is stable but attempts to place additional poles failed due to placement conflicts.\n- Maintain regular fuel supply to boilers to ensure continuous steam power generation.\n- Verify pipe connections and fluid flow remain intact for stable steam production.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
