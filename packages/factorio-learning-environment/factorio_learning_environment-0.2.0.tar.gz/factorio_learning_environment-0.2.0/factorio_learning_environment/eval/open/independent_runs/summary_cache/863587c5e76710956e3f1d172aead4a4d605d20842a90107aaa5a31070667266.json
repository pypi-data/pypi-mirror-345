{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill 1** at position (x=41.0, y=-86.0) with 8 coal in fuel inventory.\n- **Burner Mining Drill 2** at position (x=43.0, y=-86.0) with 20 coal in fuel inventory.\n- **Transport Belts** connecting the drills to a central belt system:\n  - Belt at (x=41.5, y=-84.5) and (x=42.5, y=-84.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) with 13 coal in fuel inventory, transferring coal from the belt to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-82.5) containing 622 coal.\n\n#### Furnace at Position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0) with 12 coal in fuel inventory. Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n#### Wooden Chest at Position (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n- Empty chest for potential storage.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure that the entity being refueled is within reach and has sufficient space in its fuel inventory before attempting to refuel.\n\n#### Errors with idle furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have both fuel and smeltable ingredients (e.g., iron ore, copper ore) to operate. Check the furnace's inventory and supply chain for missing inputs.\n\n#### Errors with misplaced or disconnected belts\n- Verify that transport belts are correctly connected to mining drills, inserters, and chests to ensure smooth item flow. Misaligned belts can cause items to drop or stop production.\n\n#### Errors with insufficient fuel\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills and inserters to avoid downtime. Refuel entities before they run out of coal to maintain continuous operation."}
