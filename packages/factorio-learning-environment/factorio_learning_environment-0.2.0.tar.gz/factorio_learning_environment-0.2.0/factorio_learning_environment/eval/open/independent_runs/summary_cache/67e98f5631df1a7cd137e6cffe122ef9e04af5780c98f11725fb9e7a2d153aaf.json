{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 80-87)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5) with connection issues\n- Boiler (position -5.0, -0.5) with fluid connection problems\n- Steam engine (position -1.5, -0.5) missing (removed/failed placement)\n- Partial water pipe network (system 3195) with gaps\n- Attempted new boiler placement at (-5.5, -0.5) failed\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at position (15.5, 70.5)\n(No changes from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 17.5, 70.5) with 35 iron ore\n- Transport belt (position 17.5, 72.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 15.5, 72.5)\n- Belt group connecting to position (25.5, 72.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Offshore Pump Placement Issues\n- Missing offshore pump in inventory (steps 80, 86)\n- Placement too far from player (step 85)\n- Crafting dependency chain failure (step 87)\n- Solutions:\n  - Maintain offshore pump inventory\n  - Verify placement distance before attempting\n  - Establish copper plate production first\n\n### Fluid System Connection Problems\n- Persistent boiler connection failures (steps 81-83)\n- Missing steam engine entity (step 82)\n- Invalid boiler placement attempts (step 84)\n- Solutions:\n  - Verify all components exist before connection\n  - Clear target positions completely\n  - Use debug checks for fluid boxes\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Missing critical components (steps 80, 86-87)\n- Solutions:\n  - Implement component inventory tracking\n  - Prioritize basic material production\n  - Add crafting dependency checks\n\n### Placement Validation\n- Multiple placement failures (steps 80, 84-86)\n- Solutions:\n  - Add pre-placement position validation\n  - Check terrain and obstacles\n  - Verify inventory before placement attempts\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(source: Entity, target: Entity) -> BeltGroup`\n  - Needs fluid system specialization\n  - Requires connection validation\n\n### Important Variables\n- `water_pos: Position` - Target for new pump placement\n- `boiler: Boiler` - Still not properly connected\n- Power system variables need complete reset\n- Crafting system variables missing critical components"}
