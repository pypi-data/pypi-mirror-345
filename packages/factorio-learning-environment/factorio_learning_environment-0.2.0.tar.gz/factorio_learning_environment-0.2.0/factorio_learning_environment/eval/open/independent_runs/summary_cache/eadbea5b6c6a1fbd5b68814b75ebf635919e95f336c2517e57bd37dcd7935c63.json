{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler is responsible for heating water to produce steam, while the steam engine converts steam into electricity.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) which extracts iron ore from the ground.\n- Belt group (position 40.5, -84.5) that connects the burner mining drill to the stone furnace.\n\n### Wooden chests\nMultiple wooden chests are located at various positions:\n- Chest at position (46.5, -83.5)\n- Chest at position (48.5, -83.5)\n- Chest at position (5.5, -79.5)\n- Chest at position (10.5, -79.5)\n- Chest at position (-4.5, -63.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient resources\n- Ensure you have enough pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Ensure the Offshore Pump is in your inventory before trying to place it.\n\n### Errors when connecting Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Make sure to check the fluid connections and ensure that the boiler has access to water before attempting to connect it to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
