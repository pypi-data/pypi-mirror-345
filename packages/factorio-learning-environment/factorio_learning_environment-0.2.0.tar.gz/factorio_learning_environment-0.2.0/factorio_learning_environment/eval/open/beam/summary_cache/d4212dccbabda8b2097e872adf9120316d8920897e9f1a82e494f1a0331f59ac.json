{"content": "The error indicates that there are not enough Small Electric Poles in the inventory to establish a connection between the power pole and the assembling machine. The game requires three poles to make the connection, but only one is available. Here's how you can address this issue:\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Craft Additional Small Electric Poles:**\n   - Ensure you have the necessary materials to craft more Small Electric Poles.\n   - Each pole requires 2 units of wood and 1 unit of copper cable.\n\n2. **Gather Required Materials:**\n   - If you lack materials, gather more wood and craft copper cables from copper plates.\n\n3. **Craft and Place Additional Poles:**\n   - Craft the required number of Small Electric Poles.\n   - Place them strategically to connect the power network.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check and gather materials for crafting Small Electric Poles\nrequired_poles = 3\ncurrent_poles = inventory.get(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, 0)\npoles_to_craft = required_poles - current_poles\n\n# Check materials\nwood_needed = poles_to_craft * 2\ncopper_cable_needed = poles_to_craft * 1\n\n# Gather wood if necessary\nif inventory.get(Prototype.Wood, 0) < wood_needed:\n    wood_position = nearest(Resource.Wood)\n    move_to(wood_position)\n    gather_wood = harvest_resource(wood_position, quantity=wood_needed - inventory.get(Prototype.Wood, 0))\n    assert gather_wood > 0, \"Failed to gather enough wood.\"\n\n# Craft copper cables if necessary\nif inventory.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0) < copper_cable_needed:\n    if inventory.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0) > 0:\n        craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, quantity=copper_cable_needed - inventory.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0))\n\n# Step 2: Craft the required number of Small Electric Poles\ncrafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, quantity=poles_to_craft)\nassert crafted_poles >= poles_to_craft, \"Failed to craft the required number of Small Electric Poles.\"\n\n# Step 3: Place the Small Electric Poles to create a power network\n# Place poles in a line or grid to connect the assembling machine\npole_positions = [Position(x=3.5, y=0.5), Position(x=4.0, y=0.5), Position(x=4.5, y=0.5)]\n\nfor position in pole_positions:\n    move_to(position)\n    place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, position)\n\n# Step 4: Connect the assembling machine to the power network\nconnect_entities(power_pole_entity, assembling_machine_entity, connection_type=Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\n\n# Step 5: Insert required materials into the assembling machine\ncopper_plates_quantity = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, assembling_machine_entity, quantity=copper_plates_quantity)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronPlate, assembling_machine_entity, quantity=5)\n\n# Step 6: Allow some time for operations and verify\nsleep(10)\n\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nassembling_machine_inventory = inspect_inventory(assembling_machine_entity)\n\nprint(f\"Final Inventory after setup: {final_inventory}\")\nprint(f\"Assembling Machine Inventory: {assembling_machine_inventory}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n\n- **Resource Management:** Always check your inventory for required materials before attempting to craft or place entities.\n- **Strategic Placement:** When placing electric poles, ensure they are within range to connect to each other and the target entity.\n- **Error Handling:** Use assertions and checks to handle errors gracefully and provide informative messages for debugging.\n\nThis approach should help you successfully connect the assembling machine to the power network and ensure continuous production.", "summary_range": "[1-100]"}
