{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) refueled with coal, responsible for mining iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) used for storing mined iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0) producing iron plates from iron ore.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-8.5, -47.5) used for transferring materials between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -46.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) producing iron plates from iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) used for transferring materials to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserters are blocked\n- Ensure that the destination of the inserters is not blocked. Regularly check and clear the output chests or belts to prevent inserters from being unable to place items.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move closer to the target entity from which you want to extract items before attempting to extract them.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity onto a tile before attempting to place it, to avoid conflicts with existing entities."}
