It has 30 wood as fuel and is processing 7 iron ore, which will produce additional iron plates.\n\n**Current Inventory:**\n- 1 stone furnace\n- 2 iron plates (remaining from previous crafts)\n- 1 iron gear wheel\n\n**Entities on the Map:**\n1. The new stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) is operational, processing the iron ore and has sufficient wood remaining.\n2. The existing furnace at (-1.0, 2.0) has wood but no ingredients to smelt.\n3. The last furnace at (1.0, 2.0) is out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Next Steps\nNow we need to wait for the smelting process to complete so we can gather more iron plates. Once we have enough iron plates, we can finally craft the Assembling Machine 1 and then proceed to craft the burner mining drill.\n\nLet's wait for a short duration to allow the furnace to process the iron ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a short period to allow the stone furnace to process the iron ore\nfor _ in range(10):  # Checking over 10 seconds\n    sleep(1)  # Waits 1 second between checks\n    new_furnace_status = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\n    \n    if new_furnace_status.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 1) >= 1:  # Check if any iron plates were produced\n        print(\"Iron plate(s) are ready for extraction from the new furnace.\")\n        break\nelse:\n    print(\"Smelting timeout - check fuel and inputs for the new furnace.\")  # If we didn't find iron plates after 10 seconds\n\n# Check for produced iron plates in the new stone furnace\nprint(f\"New Stone Furnace Inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory(new_furnace)}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-120]"}
