{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5) and (-14.5, -45.5) for moving items between furnaces and belts.\n- Wooden chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Transport belts connecting the furnaces and chests, facilitating the movement of iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Generator\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5) for water intake.\n- Boilers and steam engines are intended to be connected, but there are connection issues preventing full functionality.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups for fluid transport, currently empty and not fully operational due to connection issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Steam Engines and Boilers\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between boilers and steam engines. Verify that the positions are correct and that there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities on Unplaceable Terrain\n- Avoid placing entities on water or other unplaceable terrains. Check the terrain before attempting to place an entity and adjust the position accordingly.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Ensure that all required components are available in the inventory before attempting to craft or place entities. Check inventory levels and craft necessary items beforehand.\n\n### Errors in Naming and Referencing Entities\n- Verify that entity names and references are correctly defined and accessible in the code. Double-check spelling and ensure that the entity exists before attempting to interact with it.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Gather all necessary ingredients for crafting before initiating the crafting process. Review the recipe requirements and ensure that all components are available."}
