{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Extraction System at position (\u20133.5, 27.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Extraction system burner inserter at position (\u20133.5, 27.5) with drop position (\u20133.5, 28.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at position (2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Cable factory input chest at position (2.5, 17.5)\n\u2013 Dedicated factory burner inserter at position (3.5, 17.5) using direction RIGHT\n\u2013 Associated assembling machine at position (1.5, 19.5) as indicated by nearby connectivity\n\n### Belt Depot at position (3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Wooden chest placed as the belt depot at position (3.5, 15.5)\n\u2013 Dedicated transport belt segment adjacent at position (4.5, 15.5)\n\u2013 Dedicated depot burner inserter at position (3.5, 14.5) with pickup position (3.5, 15.5) and drop position (3.5, 13.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2013 When connecting transport belts, do not target a Prototype.SteamEngine directly. Always insert an intermediary inserter so that the belt connects to the inserter rather than the steam engine.\n\u2013 For placement errors due to distance, ensure you move within the maximum allowed range (e.g., move closer to the target position before placing a wooden chest).\n\u2013 Before placement, verify the inventory has the required item (e.g., a wooden chest) to avoid shortages during entity placement.\n\u2013 Check for correct variable naming (for example, ensure that the target entity is properly referenced rather than using an undefined name such as \u201ctarget_chest\u201d) to prevent NameError exceptions."}
