{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). The drill is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n  \n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input. The furnace is working with iron plates being produced.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input. The furnace is working with iron plates being produced.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel but no ingredients to smelt, resulting in a warning.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from stopping due to a full chest.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) is supplied with the necessary ingredients to prevent it from being idle.\n\n### Furnace Result Full\n- Regularly extract iron plates from the furnaces to ensure continuous production and avoid warnings of full output slots.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the quantities of items like 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus - Status of the burner mining drill, indicating whether it's working or has warnings.\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus - Status of each furnace, indicating whether it's working or has warnings."}
