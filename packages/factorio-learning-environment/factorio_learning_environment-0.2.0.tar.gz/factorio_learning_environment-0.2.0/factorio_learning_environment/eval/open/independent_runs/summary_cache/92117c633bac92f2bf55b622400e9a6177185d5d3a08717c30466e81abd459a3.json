{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) with inventory: {'iron-ore': 259, 'iron-plate': 41}\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 71}\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 63}\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 39}\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-45.5)\n\n### Coal and Iron Plate Storage at Position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) with inventory: {'coal': 256}\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 28}\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=40.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), and (x=43.5, y=-80.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of source items to avoid them waiting idly. Check the supply chain and ensure all components are functioning and connected properly.\n\n### Failed to Transfer Iron Ore to Furnace\n- Verify that the furnaces have enough space and that the inserters are correctly positioned to transfer items into the furnace. Ensure that the furnaces are not full and have available inventory space for additional iron ore.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly check and clear out chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of connected mining drills and inserters."}
