Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (for example, do not pass \u201cradius\u201d if only positional arguments are accepted).\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Retrieval:\n  \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab, verify that the required Lab item is present in the inventory.\n  \u2013 When processing the result from get_entities, check that it is not None (or use an empty list as fallback) to prevent iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Management:\n  \u2013 Confirm that all sub-ingredients needed for Lab crafting are available, and that the associated production chains (e.g. for iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are properly supported by available smelting or crafting facilities.\n  \u2013 Reassess resource availability before reattempting Lab crafting to avoid missing ingredient errors.
