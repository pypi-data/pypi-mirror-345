For example, use `PipeGroup` instead of `PipeToGround`.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Overlapping with Water\n- Verify the target position before placing entities to ensure they do not overlap with water. Consider adjusting the position or using a different location.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Existing Entities\n- Check if the target position is occupied by another entity before placing a new one. Remove any existing entities if necessary.\n\n### Insertion Errors Due to Inventory Shortage\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity."}
