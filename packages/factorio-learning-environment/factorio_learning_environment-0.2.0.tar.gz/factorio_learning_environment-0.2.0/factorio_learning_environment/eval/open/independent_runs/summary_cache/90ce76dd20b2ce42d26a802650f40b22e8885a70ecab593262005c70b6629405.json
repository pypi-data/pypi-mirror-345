{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map during these operations. Although there were multiple attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), none succeeded, and the final map state remains without any agent\u2010placed structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities usage errors\n  - Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or passing unexpected positional parameters. Verify the API\u2019s expected signature before calling get_entities.\n  \n\u2022 Lab placement failures\n  - Ensure that a Lab is available in the inventory prior to attempting its placement to avoid placement errors.\n  \n\u2022 Iteration over a None value\n  - Check that the result from get_entities is a valid iterable (and not None) before applying filters or iteration.\n  \n\u2022 Lab crafting deficiencies\n  - Confirm that all prerequisite sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are craftable and present in sufficient quantities. Reassess production chains to meet the full resource requirements for Lab crafting."}
