These setups feed raw materials into the furnaces and collect the smelted outputs.\n\n\u2022 Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup  \n  Consists of a burner\u2011mining drill positioned at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) linked with a wooden chest (around (\u201313.5, \u201351.5)) and an integrated transport\u2010belt network that distributes the extracted ore.\n\n\u2022 Steam Power Generation System  \n  Consists of a boiler at (8.0, 20.5) and multiple steam engines located at positions such as (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5) and (4.5, 23.5). An extra steam engine remains unplaced due to severe congestion both in the boiler\u2019s connection zone and in the adjacent buildable area near (8.5, 22.5).\n\n\u2022 Automation Research Lab  \n  Processes automation science packs but currently remains without power owing to unstable or missing electrical connectivity.\n\n\u2022 Electrical and Transport Infrastructure  \n  Encompasses an integrated network of electrical poles, transport belts (organized as BeltGroups), pipes (organized as PipeGroups), and associated connection groups that supply coherent connectivity between production areas and power/fluid systems. Note that spatial congestion is evident where multiple networks overlap.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Persistent Extra Steam Engine Placement  \n  \u2013 The extra steam engine consistently remains unplaceable due to overlapping burner\u2011inserters, misaligned transport belts, and limited clearance in the vicinity of the boiler at (8.0, 20.5) as well as the obstructed buildable area near (8.5, 22.5).  \n  \u2013 Mitigation: Conduct a thorough manual inspection of the boiler and its connection interfaces. Remove or reposition obstructing entities, consider relocating the extra engine to a less congested zone, or modify the boiler layout to provide adequate spacing.\n\n\u2022 Inadequate Fuel Supply in Burner Entities  \n  \u2013 Numerous burner\u2011inserters and the burner\u2011mining drill report \u201cNO_FUEL\u201d or \u201cWAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\u201d statuses, interrupting their operation.  \n  \u2013 Mitigation: Ensure that fuel is available consistently and that fuel sources are placed optimally adjacent to burner entities, minimizing delays in fuel extraction and transfer.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Fluid and Electrical Connectivity  \n  \u2013 Several steam engines report warnings such as \u201cnot connected to power network,\u201d \u201cno input liquid,\u201d and \u201cno fluid present in connections,\u201d indicating faulty or obstructed interfacing with the power and fluid delivery networks.  \n  \u2013 Mitigation: Reexamine all pipe and electrical connection points for each steam engine, ensuring unobstructed and properly aligned connections to both the fluid supply and the power network.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Deficiency  \n  \u2013 The Automation Research Lab remains in a NO_POWER state, disrupting research operations.  \n  \u2013 Mitigation: Reassess and adjust nearby wiring and electrical pole placements to secure a stable and reliable power connection to the lab."}
