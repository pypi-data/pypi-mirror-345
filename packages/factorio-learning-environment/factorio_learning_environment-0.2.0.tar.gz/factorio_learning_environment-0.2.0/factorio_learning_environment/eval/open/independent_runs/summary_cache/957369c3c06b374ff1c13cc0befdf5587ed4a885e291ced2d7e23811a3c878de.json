{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore. Currently fueled with coal and operational, but the chest at the drop position is full, which may halt mining operations.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Used for storing extracted iron ore and iron plates. Contains 8 iron ore and 9 iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Additional storage capacity, currently empty.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers items between chests. Fueled with coal and waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items\n- Ensure the entity you are trying to extract from contains the required items. Verify the inventory of the entity before attempting extraction to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- When placing entities next to existing structures, ensure there is enough space and no collisions with other entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to successfully place the entity.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
