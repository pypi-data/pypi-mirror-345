{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=27.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=1.5, y=27.5) with status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=-2.5, y=25.0) with status: FULL_OUTPUT\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) with status: WORKING\n- Pipe group connecting the boiler and steam engine, with positions including (x=-6.5, y=24.5), (x=-7.5, y=24.5), (x=-4.5, y=25.5), (x=-4.5, y=24.5), and (x=-5.5, y=24.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple pipe groups are present, including:\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=13.5) with status: EMPTY\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5) with status: EMPTY\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=24.5) with status: FULL_OUTPUT\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=27.5) with status: EMPTY\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=0.5, y=30.5) with status: EMPTY\n\n### Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace with status: NO_INGREDIENTS, containing iron plates and fueled by coal\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (x=-4.5, y=22.5), (x=-3.5, y=22.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5), (x=-8.5, y=18.5), (x=-7.5, y=19.5), and (x=-8.5, y=21.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler using pipes. Check that all necessary pipes are in place and correctly positioned to allow steam flow from the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Verify that pipes are correctly placed to connect the boiler and steam engine. The repeated clearing and connecting of pipes suggest potential placement issues. Double-check pipe positions to ensure a complete and functional connection.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Status\n- The steam engine remains in a NOT_CONNECTED status. Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established and that there is a continuous path for steam to flow from the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Fueling\n- Ensure that the boiler is consistently fueled with coal to maintain steam production. Regularly check the fuel inventory and replenish as necessary to prevent interruptions in steam generation."}
