{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 4})\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron-ore (40000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts is not already occupied by another entity or item. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Double-check the code for any undefined variables or typos. For instance, ensure that all variables like `ore_furnace` are properly defined before use.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Verify that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure there is coal available in the inventory before trying to insert it into a burner mining drill.\n\n### Warnings related to blocked outputs\n- Address warnings about blocked outputs by ensuring there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like the Burner Mining Drill. This will help maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Warnings related to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for entities like furnaces to function correctly. This will prevent warnings about missing ingredients and ensure efficient production."}
