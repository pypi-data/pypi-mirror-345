{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) with a current inventory of 8 iron-ore and 0 iron-plate. It has been used to smelt iron-ore into iron-plates, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) with an inventory containing 5 coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) which is currently out of fuel and unable to operate. It has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5) where it attempts to drop resources into the wooden chest.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting fuel into the furnace with no ingredients to smelt**: Ensure that there are ingredients available in the furnace's inventory before attempting to insert fuel.\n- **Errors when the furnace result is full**: Check the inventory of the furnace before inserting fuel to ensure that it has space for the output. If the result inventory is full, the furnace cannot process more materials.\n- **Errors when the burner mining drill is out of fuel**: Make sure the burner mining drill has sufficient fuel before attempting to operate it. Regularly check its status and replenish fuel as needed.\n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**: Empty the chest at the drop position to allow the burner mining drill to continue mining. Regularly monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined**:\n  - `insert_fuel(entity, fuel)`: Used to insert fuel into the furnace. Failure occurs if the furnace has no ingredients to smelt or if the result inventory is full.\n  - `extract_items(entity, count)`: Used to extract items from the furnace or chest. Success occurs when there are sufficient items available to extract.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `coal: int` - Total amount of coal available.\n  - `iron_ore: int` - Total amount of iron ore available.\n  - `iron_plate: int` - Total amount of iron plates produced.\n  - `wood: int` - Total amount of wood available."}
