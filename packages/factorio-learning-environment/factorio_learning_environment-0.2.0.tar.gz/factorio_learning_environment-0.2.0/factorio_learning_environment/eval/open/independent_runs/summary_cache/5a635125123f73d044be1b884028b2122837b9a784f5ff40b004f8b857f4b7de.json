{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Consists of two Stone Furnaces at positions (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0), a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5), and a series of Transport Belts connecting to various positions including (-24.5, -69.5), (-22.5, -69.5), (-21.5, -68.5), and (-21.5, -66.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0), a Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), and a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\n- Consists of a Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) and a Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Belt Groups\n- Multiple Belt Groups connecting various positions for efficient transport of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure continuous placement of transport belts without gaps to avoid connection errors. Verify the path and alignment of belts before placing them.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned with the source entity.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients for smelting. Verify the input source and supply chain to the furnace.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills and Inserters to maintain continuous operation."}
