{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 6})\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron ore (39998 units)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is free from other entities before attempting to place a new entity. This includes checking for existing structures or items on the ground that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Verify the position and existence of entities before attempting to retrieve or interact with them. Use accurate coordinates and ensure the entity type matches the expected type at that position.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory for actions\n- Always check your inventory for the required items before attempting actions that consume resources, such as inserting items into drills or furnaces.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new positions\n- Confirm that the new position is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity. Ensure that the destination does not overlap with other structures or blocked tiles.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity or storage available to accept outputs from production entities like drills or furnaces to prevent blockage and inefficiencies."}
