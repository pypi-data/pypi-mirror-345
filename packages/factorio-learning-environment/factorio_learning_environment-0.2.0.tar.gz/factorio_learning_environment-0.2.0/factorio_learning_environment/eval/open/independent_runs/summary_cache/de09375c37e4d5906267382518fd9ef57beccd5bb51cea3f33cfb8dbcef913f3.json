{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\nThis facility is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Coal and iron ore are inserted into the stone furnace to produce iron plates.\n\n### Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n\nThis structure is intended to pump water, likely for use in steam power generation. However, further components such as boilers and steam engines are required to complete the power generation setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Attempting to Place Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to place is in your inventory. For example, the offshore pump could not be placed because it was not in the inventory initially.\n- When placing entities next to each other, verify that there is enough space and that the area is suitable for placement. The attempt to place a boiler next to the offshore pump failed due to collision with water tiles. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or position.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Before crafting an item, ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available. For example, crafting an offshore pump failed initially because the necessary iron plates and iron gear wheels were not available.\n- Understand the production chain for each item. For instance, iron plates must be smelted in a furnace, and copper cables require copper plates, which also need to be smelted.\n\n### Type Errors in Code\n- When performing arithmetic operations with attributes, ensure that the data types are compatible. The error \"unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'ModelPrivateAttr' and 'int'\" suggests a type mismatch. Verify that the attributes used in calculations are of the correct type.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Make sure the entity from which you are extracting items contains the desired items. The error when extracting copper plates indicated that the stone furnace did not contain any copper plates at the time of extraction. Ensure the furnace has completed the smelting process before attempting extraction."}
