{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Production at (0,0) and (2,0)\nConsists of two production lines:\n- Stone furnace at (0,0) processing iron ore into plates, fueled by coal\n- Stone furnace at (2,0) processing iron ore into plates, fueled by coal\n\n###Copper Plate Production at (4,4) and (6,4)\nConsists of two production lines:\n- Stone furnace at (4,4) processing copper ore into plates, fueled by coal\n- Stone furnace at (6,4) processing copper ore into plates, fueled by coal\n\n###Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) converting water to steam, fueled by coal\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes connecting offshore pump to boiler (fluid system 1565)\n  - Steam pipes connecting boiler to steam engine (fluid system 1567)\n- Electric pole network connecting power to facilities (poles at x=8.5 y=2.5, 6.5, 18.5, 10.5, 14.5 and x=6.5 y=24.5)\n\n###Research Facility\n- Lab researching electronics technology, powered by electricity (electrical_id=1640)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items\n- Common examples:\n  - Attempting to insert coal into boiler without coal in inventory\n  - Attempting to insert ore into furnaces when inventory is empty\n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are properly defined before use\n- Example: Attempting to use 'coal' variable without defining it first\n\n### Errors with research item insertion\n- Verify the target entity can accept the research items before attempting insertion\n- Example: Could not insert electronic circuits for research because no suitable entity was found nearby"}
