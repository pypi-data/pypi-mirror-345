{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with coal as fuel, currently working but with a warning of \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing any entity, such as Stone Furnace, Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, or Transport Belt, is unoccupied and valid for the specific entity type before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position. For example, ensure that a Stone Furnace is present at the given coordinates before attempting to get it.\n\n### Errors due to output blockage\n- Make sure that the output path of entities like Burner Mining Drills is clear and that there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or a belt) to accept the output to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- Confirm that the destination location for moving entities like Stone Furnace is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type to avoid movement errors."}
