{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) - operational with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups\n- Small electric pole at position (0.5, 8.5) connecting steam engine to power network\nCurrent status: Operational and producing approximately 1134 water and 1128 steam per minute.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (33.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position (33.5, 20.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (33.5, 22.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (35.5, 22.5) containing 659 coal\n- Inserter at position (34.5, 22.5) to move coal from first chest to second chest\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nCurrent status: Operational and producing approximately 42 coal per minute.\n\n### Oil Processing Facility at (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5) extracting crude oil\n- Oil refinery at position (25.5, 45.5) set to basic oil processing\n- Petroleum storage tank at position (32.5, 47.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups, though currently experiencing connection issues\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nCurrent status: Partially operational with the pumpjack extracting crude oil (approximately 439 per minute), but the refinery is experiencing a fluid ingredient shortage due to connection issues between the pumpjack and refinery.\n\n### Plastic Production System\nConsists of:\n- First chemical plant at position (39.5, 51.5) set to produce plastic bars\n- Second chemical plant at position (45.5, 51.5) also set to produce plastic bars\n- Coal chest at position (38.5, 53.5) containing 35 coal\n- Coal chest at position (45.5, 48.5)\n- Coal inserter at position (45.5, 49.5) to feed coal to second chemical plant\n- Plastic output inserter at position (39.5, 55.5)\n- Second plastic output inserter at position (45.5, 55.5)\n- Plastic output chest at position (39.5, 57.5)\n- Second plastic output chest at position (45.5, 57.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nCurrent status: Not operational due to item ingredient shortage. Both chemical plants are missing coal resources needed for plastic bar production.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity connections\n- When connecting entities with power poles, ensure the pole is placed in a valid position where it can reach both entities\n- When connecting fluid-based entities, ensure the source entity already contains the fluid before attempting to connect to a destination that requires that specific fluid type\n- When connecting distant fluid entities (like pumpjack to oil refinery or refinery to storage tank), make sure there's a valid path for the pipes to follow and no connection points are blocked\n- When connecting petroleum gas pipes to chemical plants, ensure the pipe already contains petroleum gas before attempting the connection\n- When connecting boiler to steam engine, verify there's a clear path between them and none of the connection points are blocked\n- When connecting pipe groups, ensure the distance isn't too great - you may need to use underground pipes for longer distances\n- When attempting to connect pipe groups, check that the source and target connection points are properly aligned and not blocked\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Check for existing entities (like pipes or power poles) before placing new entities to avoid collisions\n- When placing entities next to others, consider increasing the spacing parameter if placement fails\n- Be aware of the direction parameter when placing entities, as it affects where the entity's connection points will be\n- When placing inserters, check that both pickup and drop positions are clear and valid\n- For chest placement, verify the target position is not already occupied by another entity or item\n- When placing an inserter to feed a chemical plant, carefully check the surrounding area for obstructions and ensure proper alignment with input/output positions\n- Before placing a pipe at a specific position, check if there's already a pipe or other entity at that location\n- When placing a chest near an inserter"}
