{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automated Coal Mining System (around position 38,-83)\nA self-sustaining coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (38.0, -83.0) mining coal with 15 fuel units\n- Transport belt system from (39.5, -86.5) to (39.5, -83.5) moving coal\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - Recycling inserter (38.5, -84.5) feeding coal back to miner\n  - Output inserter (40.5, -86.5) moving coal to storage\n- Output wooden chest (41.5, -86.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (around position 45,-80)\nA dual furnace smelting setup with:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\n- Multiple wooden chests for input/output storage:\n  - Output chests at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) containing iron plates\n  - Coal storage chests at (45.5, -77.5) and (47.5, -77.5)\n  - Additional storage at (49.5, -79.5) containing mixed resources\n- Multiple burner inserters managing material flow:\n  - Two inserters at (45.5, -81.5) and (47.5, -81.5) moving completed plates\n  - Two inserters at (45.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5) handling input materials\n- Transport belt system at (52.5, -81.5) to (56.5, -81.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n1. Belt Flow Issues\n- Ensure transport belts are properly oriented in the intended direction of flow\n- Clear any blocked belts that may be preventing mining operations\n\n2. Space Management\n- Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow (noted in chest at 49.5, -80.5)\n- Ensure sufficient space in destination containers before starting operations\n\n3. Resource Supply Chain\n- Keep furnaces supplied with both fuel and ingredients to prevent idle state\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner inserters and mining drills\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- None significant noted in provided logs\n\n### Functions\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\nThe system appears to be operational but requires optimization of material flow and storage management."}
