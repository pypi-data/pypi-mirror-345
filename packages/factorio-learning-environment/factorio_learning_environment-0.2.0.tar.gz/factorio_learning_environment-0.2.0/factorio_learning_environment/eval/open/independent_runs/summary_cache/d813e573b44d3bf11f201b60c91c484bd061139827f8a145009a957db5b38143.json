(Position not specified)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2013 Belt Connection Errors:\n  \u2022 Transport belts were repeatedly attempted to be connected directly to a steam engine target. Always route belts to an appropriate inserter that feeds items into the steam engine rather than targeting the engine itself.\n\n\u2013 Entity Placement Distance Errors:\n  \u2022 Attempts to place a wooden chest failed because the player was too far from the target position. Move closer to the desired placement location (within the maximum distance allowed) before placing an entity.\n\n\u2013 Inventory Shortage Errors:\n  \u2022 Failures occurred when trying to place a wooden chest without it being present in the inventory. Confirm that the required entity is available in inventory prior to placement.\n\n\u2013 Variable Naming Issues:\n  \u2022 A NameError was raised due to using an undefined variable (\u2018target_chest\u2019). Ensure variable names are correctly defined and consistently referenced (for example, using existing identifiers like target_pos, target_place_pos, or depot_chest)."}
