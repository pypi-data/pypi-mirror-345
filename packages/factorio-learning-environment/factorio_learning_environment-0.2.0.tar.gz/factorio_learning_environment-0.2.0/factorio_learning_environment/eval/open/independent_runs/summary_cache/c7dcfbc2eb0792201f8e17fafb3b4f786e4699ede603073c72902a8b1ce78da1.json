{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel.\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Wooden chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), (x=-12.5, y=-50.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5).\n  - Iron chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with coal fuel.\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional wooden chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from full chests\n- Ensure that the target chest has enough space before attempting to extract items. Consider emptying or transferring items from full chests to prevent extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when mining with full drop chests\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of a mining drill is not full. Empty or transfer items from the chest to continue mining operations without interruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- No utility functions were defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_chest_inventory: dict` - Tracks the inventory of iron ore in the chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5).\n- `final_inventory: dict` - Represents the agent's final inventory after the current step.\n\nNote: The logs did not indicate any specific utility functions being defined or invoked."}
