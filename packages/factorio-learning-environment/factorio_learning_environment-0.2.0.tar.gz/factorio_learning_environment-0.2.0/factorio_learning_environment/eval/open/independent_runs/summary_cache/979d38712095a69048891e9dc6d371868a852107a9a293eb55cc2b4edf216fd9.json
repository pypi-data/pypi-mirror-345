{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal storage and mining setup at x=-28.5 y=-62.5\n- **Coal chest** at position (-28.5, -62.5) containing 20 coal.\n- **Mining drill** at position (-28.0, -61.0) currently out of fuel and with a full drop chest at (-27.5, -59.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert coal into the mining drill\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the mining drill. Repeatedly picking up coal from the storage chest without successfully transferring it to your inventory leads to failed insertion attempts.\n\n#### Errors when extracting coal from the storage chest\n- Verify that the extraction method is correctly implemented. The agent repeatedly failed to extract coal from the storage chest, which prevented it from fueling the mining drill.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to craft coal\n- Coal is a raw resource and cannot be crafted. Ensure you are harvesting coal from coal patches instead of attempting to craft it.\n\n#### Errors when harvesting coal due to full inventory\n- Free up inventory space before attempting to harvest coal. The agent failed to harvest coal because its inventory was full, despite having space in the storage chest.\n\n#### Errors when the mining drill's drop chest is full\n- Regularly empty the drop chest at (-27.5, -59.5) to allow the mining drill to continue operating. A full drop chest halts mining operations.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **extract_item**: Attempts to extract items from a storage entity. Failed due to incorrect implementation or insufficient permissions.\n- **craft**: Attempts to craft items. Failed when attempting to craft coal, as it is a raw resource.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **Player inventory**: Dict containing quantities of iron-ore, copper-ore, and iron-plate.\n- **Coal chest contents**: Dict containing the quantity of coal in the storage chest."}
