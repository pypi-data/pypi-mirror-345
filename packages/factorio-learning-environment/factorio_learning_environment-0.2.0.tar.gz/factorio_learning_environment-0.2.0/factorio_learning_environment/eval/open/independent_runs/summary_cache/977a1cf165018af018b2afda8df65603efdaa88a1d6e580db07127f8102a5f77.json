{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5) connected to a wooden chest at (53.5, -80.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring items from the mining drill to a wooden chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5) connected to a stone furnace at (-14.0, -49.0) and a wooden chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring items from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Manual Extraction Errors\n- Ensure that you are close enough to the target entity before attempting manual extraction to avoid failure.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to function properly. This may involve ensuring that upstream processes are not blocked or that there are no missing items.\n\n### Inserter and Chest Blockages\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent blockages in the production line. Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept outputs from mining drills and inserters.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
