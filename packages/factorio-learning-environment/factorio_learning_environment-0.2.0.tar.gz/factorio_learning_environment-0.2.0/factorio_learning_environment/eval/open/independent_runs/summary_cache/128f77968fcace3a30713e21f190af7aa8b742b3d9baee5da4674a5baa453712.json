{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a transport belt moving coal to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, with pickup position at (0.5, 0.5) and drop position at (2.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing processed items.\n- BeltGroup connecting the inserter to the furnace.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (10.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) working, with pickup position at (10.5, 0.5) and drop position at (12.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### Intermediate Storage and Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron and copper plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (6.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, with pickup position at (5.5, 0.5) and drop position at (7.5, 0.5).\n- Burner inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, with pickup position at (7.5, 0.5) and drop position at (9.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This error occurred multiple times when trying to place a wooden chest at positions (0.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), and (10.5, 0.5).\n\n### Errors due to missing entities for inserters\n- Verify that the source and drop positions for inserters have the necessary entities. Errors were noted for inserters at positions (1.5, 0.5), (6.5, 0.5), and (11.5, 0.5) due to missing entities at their respective source or drop positions.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have the necessary items to avoid waiting states. This was observed for the inserter at position (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Clearing blockages\n- Regularly check and clear blockages at key positions to maintain efficient item flow. Blockages were cleared at positions (4.5, 0.5), (9.5, 0.5), and (12.5, 0.5)."}
