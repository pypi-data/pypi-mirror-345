{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided execution logs.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo clear structures are fully visible in these logs, but there appears to be:\n\n###Belt Transport System\n- Main belt line extending to position (44.5, -81.5)\n- Complex belt network with approximately 105-107 belts\n- Input belt at position (-4.5, -54.5) oriented UP\n- Multiple connecting belts around positions (-4.5, -52.5), (-4.5, -53.5), (-5.5, -53.5)\n- Output belt at position (44.5, -81.5) oriented RIGHT\n\n###Inserter Setup\n- Burner inserter at position (-6.5, -52.5) facing RIGHT\n- Drop position at (-4.5, -52.5)\n- Pickup position at (-6.5, -52.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always check if a position is clear before placing new entities\n- Remove existing entities before attempting to place new ones at the same position\n- Multiple instances of \"entity already exists at target position\" errors at (-4.5, -53.5) and (-5.5, -53.5)\n\n2. Belt Flow Issues\n- Ensure proper belt orientation and connections before building complex transport systems\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to use them for item transport\n- Multiple warnings about \"transport belt at drop position is blocked\"\n\n3. Inserter Output Problems\n- Ensure there is a proper destination entity or belt to receive items from inserters\n- Warning seen: \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output\"\n\nNAMESPACE\nFunctions and Operations observed:\n- Belt placement operations\n- Inserter rotation operations\n- Entity removal operations\n- Belt system verification checks\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Belt group status: EntityStatus (WORKING/EMPTY)\n- Belt inventory: Dictionary containing items on belts\n- Inserter status: EntityStatus\n- Direction enums: UP, RIGHT, DOWN (used for entity orientation)\n- Position coordinates: x, y floating point values"}
