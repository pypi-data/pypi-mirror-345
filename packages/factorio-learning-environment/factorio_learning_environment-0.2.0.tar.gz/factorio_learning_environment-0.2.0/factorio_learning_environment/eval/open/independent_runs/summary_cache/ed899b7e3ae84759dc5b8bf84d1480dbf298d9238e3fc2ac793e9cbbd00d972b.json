{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at (41.0, -82.0): Extracts coal from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (41.5, -80.5): Stores extracted coal.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Stone Furnace** at (-13.0, -50.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (-14.5, -48.5): Stores iron ore and iron plates.\n\n#### Additional Smelting Setup at Position (-15.0, -47.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at (-15.0, -47.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Stone Furnace** at (-13.0, -47.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n#### Inserter and Furnace Setup at Position (-16.5, -44.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at (-16.5, -44.5): Transfers items between entities.\n- **Stone Furnace** at (-15.0, -45.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n#### Inserter and Furnace Setup at Position (-13.5, -44.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at (-13.5, -44.5): Transfers items between entities.\n- **Stone Furnace** at (-15.0, -45.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces or inserters. For example:\n  - **Iron Ore Insertion**: The agent repeatedly tried to insert iron ore into furnaces without having enough iron ore in its inventory.\n  - **Coal Insertion**: The agent attempted to insert coal into inserters without sufficient coal in its inventory.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Always check if a tile is free before placing an entity. This prevents errors caused by overlapping entities.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., chest or furnace) has the items you want to extract before attempting to extract them.\n\n#### General Tips\n- Monitor your inventory and ensure you have the necessary resources before performing actions.\n- Double-check the status of entities (e.g., furnaces, inserters) to ensure they are ready to receive items."}
