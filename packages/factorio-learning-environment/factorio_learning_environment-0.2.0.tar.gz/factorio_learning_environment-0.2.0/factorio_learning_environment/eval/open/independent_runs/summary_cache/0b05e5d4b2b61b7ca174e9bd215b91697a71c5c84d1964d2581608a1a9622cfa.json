{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing 50 units of coal. The furnace is currently not operational due to lack of ingredients to smelt and its fuel source being full. It has produced 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Group\nConsists of:\n- Pipes connecting various positions: (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5). The pipe system is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of:\n- Electric poles at positions: (x=-8.5, y=17.5), (x=-7.5, y=15.5), (x=-6.5, y=16.5), ..., (x=-8.5, y=16.5), (x=-5.5, y=25.5), (x=0.5, y=24.5). The voltage is currently at 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving to a new area\n- Ensure that the indices used for positions are integers. Avoid using strings as indices when specifying positions.\n\n### Errors when placing structures at unsuitable positions\n- Verify that the position is suitable for placing structures such as boilers and steam engines before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors when connecting structures\n- Ensure that connections between structures such as offshore pumps and boilers are possible. Check that the pipes can connect properly between the specified positions.\n\n### Errors with electric pole placement\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed in suitable positions to allow for proper connectivity and avoid placement issues."}
