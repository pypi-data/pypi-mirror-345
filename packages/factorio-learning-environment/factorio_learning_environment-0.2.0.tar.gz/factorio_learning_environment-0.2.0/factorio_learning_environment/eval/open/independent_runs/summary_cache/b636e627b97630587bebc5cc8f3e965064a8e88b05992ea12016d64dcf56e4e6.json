{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace positioned at (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore. The furnace continues to process iron ore into iron plates. In the most recent update, after a previous cycle that yielded 8 iron plates and a warning of \u201cno ingredients to smelt,\u201d it received 10 additional iron ore. Although it attempted another smelting cycle, a timeout occurred; later, an extraction yielded an updated output of 9 iron plates. The structure remains as previously reported with these updated production states.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using API for item insertion\n- When inserting items into a structure, confirm that the target argument is a valid entity or entity group rather than a mere position. Ensure argument types are checked before execution. In the latest logs, an attempt to insert iron ore failed due to missing inventory items.\n\n### Resource Retrieval Errors near Target Structures\n- Verify that the target location contains or has access to the required resource before attempting any operation. Adjust either the retrieval coordinates or the resource check to avoid errors.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel during Insertion\n- Confirm the availability of required fuel (e.g., coal) in the inventory before initiating an insertion into a furnace. This avoids disruptions in production cycles due to missing resources.\n\n### Insufficient Input Resources for Insertion\n- Ensure the inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to insert them into a structure. In the current execution, an error occurred due to an attempt to insert 10 iron ore when none were available in the inventory.\n\n### Insufficient Production and Process Delays in Smelting\n- When the structure produces fewer outputs than expected, verify that both fuel and ore are adequately supplied. Adjust production intervals if necessary to prevent timeouts during smelting cycles.\n\n### Timeout Waiting for Smelting Completion\n- Maintain sufficient supply of correct input materials and fuel prior to starting a smelting cycle to avoid timeouts. Monitor production cycles closely and adjust insertion and extraction timing to prevent process delays.\n\n### Crafting Recipe Access and Production Checks\n- When printing or accessing recipes (as seen with the IronGearWheel recipe), ensure that required pre-conditions, such as available inventory items, are met to avoid subsequent insertion or production errors."}
