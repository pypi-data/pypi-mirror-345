{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with fuel inventory of coal, working status, and a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) with a direction to the right, waiting for source items, and a drop position at (x=-12.5, y=-48.5).\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Both furnaces have warnings for no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) to transfer items between chests and furnaces. Both are waiting for source items.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nThis system is used for storing and transferring iron plates and iron ore. It consists of:\n- **Multiple Wooden Chests** at various positions such as (x=-6.5, y=-49.5), (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-7.5, y=-48.5), (x=-5.5, y=-48.5), (x=-4.5, y=-48.5), (x=-3.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), and (x=-10.5, y=-46.5) with varying inventories of iron plates and iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) for transferring items to the storage chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the items you are trying to insert are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to \"No items to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Regularly check and ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. This will prevent inserters from being idle and waiting for source items.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of fuel for all burner entities to ensure continuous operation. Refuel entities like mining drills and furnaces before they run out of fuel to avoid production halts."}
