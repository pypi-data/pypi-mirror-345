For example, a 'BeltGroup' object does not have a 'prototype' attribute. Verify the object type and its attributes before attempting to access or manipulate them.\n\n### Errors Due to Undefined Names\n- Ensure all variables and classes are defined before use. For instance, 'EntityInfo' was used without being defined. Double-check the spelling and existence of variables and classes in the code.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
