{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine, ensuring water and steam flow.\n\n### Laboratory Setup at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to the power supply, currently working on logistics research.\n- Electricity network with poles at positions (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), and (x=3.5, y=20.5) providing power to the lab.\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Research Setup\n- Ensure that the lab has the necessary science packs and prerequisites for the intended research. The lab was repeatedly connected to power but was not working on research due to missing prerequisites or incorrect research settings.\n\n### Errors in Refueling Boiler\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to avoid interruptions in refueling the boiler. The agent encountered multiple instances where there was not enough coal to refuel the boiler.\n\n### Errors in Setting Research\n- Verify the research settings and ensure that the correct research is selected and initiated. The agent faced repeated errors in setting research, indicating potential issues with research selection or initiation."}
