{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with warnings of 'out of fuel' and 'chest at drop position is full'.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing 241 iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests storing iron plates at various positions:\n  - Position (5.5, -60.5) with 183 iron plates.\n  - Position (7.5, -60.5) with 183 iron plates.\n  - Position (6.5, -60.5) with 183 iron plates.\n  - Position (9.5, -60.5) with 183 iron plates.\n  - Position (8.5, -60.5) with 183 iron plates.\n  - Position (-4.5, -52.5) with 500 iron plates.\n  - Position (-11.5, -50.5) with 250 iron plates.\n  - Position (-9.5, -50.5) with 1445 iron plates.\n  - Position (-8.5, -50.5) with 1445 iron plates.\n  - Position (-7.5, -50.5) with 665 iron plates.\n  - Position (-6.5, -50.5) with 492 iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) with 1476 iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) with 1500 iron plates and 326 iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with 15 coal and warnings of 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with 11 coal and warnings of 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with 10 coal and warnings of 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when extracting from a chest\n- Ensure that the chest is not full and there is space to extract items. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing extraction.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that all Burner Mining Drills have sufficient fuel to operate. The drill at position (4.0, -60.0) is out of fuel.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that all Stone Furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) are missing ingredients.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore_chest_position`: Position(x=4.5, y=-58.5) - Type: Position\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Position(x=4.0, y=-60.0) - Type: Position\n  - `iron_plate_inventory`: Inventory({'iron-plate': 7500}) - Type: Inventory"}
