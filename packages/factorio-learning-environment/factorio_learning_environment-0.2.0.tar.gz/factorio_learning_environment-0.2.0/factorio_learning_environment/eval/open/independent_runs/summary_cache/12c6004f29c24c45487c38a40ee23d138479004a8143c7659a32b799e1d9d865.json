{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (8.5, 36.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (8.5, 36.5)\n- Boiler at position (-44.5, -123.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-45.5, -124.5)\n- Multiple PipeGroups connecting various positions, though currently not effectively connected to the boiler or steam engine.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for copper smelting.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) for iron smelting.\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0), currently not in use.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to:\n  - Small Electric Poles at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (5.5, -59.5)\n  - Wooden Chests at positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, currently not supplying power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Connections\n- Ensure the offshore pump is correctly connected to the boiler using pipes. Verify that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler to supply water.\n- Check that the boiler is connected to the steam engine to ensure steam generation.\n\n### Errors with Inserter and Power Supply\n- Ensure that the inserter is connected to a powered electric network. Verify that the small electric poles are correctly connected and supplying power to the inserter.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- When connecting pipes, ensure that each segment is properly aligned and connected to the next. Misalignment or gaps in the pipe network will prevent fluid flow.\n\n### Errors with Power Network\n- Verify that all components requiring power are connected to an active electricity network. Ensure that the electricity network is complete and capable of supplying power to all connected devices."}
