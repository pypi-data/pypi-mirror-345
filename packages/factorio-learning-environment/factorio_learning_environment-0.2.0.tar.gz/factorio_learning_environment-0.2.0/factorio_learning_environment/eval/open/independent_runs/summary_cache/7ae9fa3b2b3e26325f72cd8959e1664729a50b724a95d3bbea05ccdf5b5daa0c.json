{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore and transferring it to a chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to a stone furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\n- The Burner Mining Drill and Burner Inserters are periodically refueled with coal to ensure continuous operation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials, as seen with the inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5).\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the setup of the inserter feeding the furnace to ensure it is correctly positioned and functioning. The furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or incorrect setup of the inserter.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Refueling\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. An error occurred when attempting to refuel without sufficient coal.\n\n### Errors in Item Insertion\n- When inserting items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory. An error was encountered due to attempting to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory."}
