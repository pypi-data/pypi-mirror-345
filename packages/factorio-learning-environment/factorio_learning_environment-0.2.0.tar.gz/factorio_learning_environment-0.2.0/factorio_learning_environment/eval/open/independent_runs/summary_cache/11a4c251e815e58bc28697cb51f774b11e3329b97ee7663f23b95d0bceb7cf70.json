Multiple attempts were made to craft and place a Lab intended to supply Automation Science Packs at position (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded. While processing was performed using existing smelting furnaces (for example, one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used for iron plate production and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) used for copper plate production), these were not constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Incorrect use of get_entities API:\n  \u2013 Errors reported include an unexpected keyword argument \"radius\" and supplying positional arguments when none are expected.\n  \u2013 Tip: Verify the function signature and supply parameters exactly as specified by the API.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement failures:\n  \u2013 Multiple errors occurred when attempting to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) due to no lab item being available in the inventory.\n  \u2013 Tip: Ensure that the necessary lab components are present in the inventory before initiating placement.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting chain issues:\n  \u2013 Attempts to craft a Lab failed due to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) and deficiencies in the prerequisite production processes.\n  \u2013 Tip: Confirm that all required sub-components in the crafting chain are sufficiently available and that any necessary intermediate production (e.g., smelting and component crafting) is operational.\n\n\u2022 Handling of None values when retrieving entities:\n  \u2013 An error occurred when iterating over a NoneType returned from get_entities.\n  \u2013 Tip: Check for a None response and default to an empty list to avoid iteration errors."}
