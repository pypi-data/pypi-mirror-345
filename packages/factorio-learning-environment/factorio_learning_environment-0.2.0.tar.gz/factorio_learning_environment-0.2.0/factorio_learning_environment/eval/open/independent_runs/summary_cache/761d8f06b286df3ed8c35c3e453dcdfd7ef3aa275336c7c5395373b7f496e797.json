Throughout these steps, the furnace has been used repeatedly for smelting operations with multiple cycles of insertions (iron ore and coal) and extractions (iron plates). The furnace\u2019s activity history\u2014spanning extraction of remaining iron plates, repeated smelting attempts with varied input quantities, and adjustments of production cycles\u2014demonstrates its central role in processing raw resources into refined iron plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Repeated smelting production delays\n  - When the furnace repeatedly yields fewer iron plates than expected, verify the input ratios and consider extending wait times or checking furnace energy and fuel states to ensure optimal performance.\n\n\u2022 Incorrect argument types for insertion operations (previous)\n  - Ensure that inserts to the furnace use valid entity references rather than position values.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient inventory for input operations (previous)\n  - Confirm that inventories contain the required resource quantities before attempting insertions to avoid errors related to resource shortages.\n\n\u2022 Crafting prerequisite errors (previous)\n  - Validate the availability of all necessary raw materials before initiating crafting operations."}
