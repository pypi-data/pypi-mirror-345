{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting boiler to steam engine with pipes at positions:\n  - (-46.5, -122.5)\n  - (-47.5, -122.5)\n  - (-44.5, -123.5)\n  - (-45.5, -123.5)\n  - (-45.5, -122.5)\n  - (-42.5, -122.5)\n  - (-42.5, -123.5)\n  - (-43.5, -123.5)\n  - (-41.5, -122.5)\n  - (-41.5, -120.5)\n  - (-41.5, -121.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Structures\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to small electric poles and a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chests at positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5)\n- Lab with input of automation science pack at position (not specified)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure correct alignment and connectivity of pipes between entities. Verify that all pipes are properly connected to both the boiler and the steam engine.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Check that the steam engine is connected to a power network and receiving the necessary input liquid. Ensure that all connections are secure and that there is sufficient fluid flow.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Offshore Pump\n- Confirm that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the boiler with pipes. Verify that the pump is positioned correctly and that all pipes are aligned to facilitate fluid transfer.\n\n### Warnings of No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply the furnaces with required materials to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the power network to ensure that inserters are connected and receiving electricity. Verify that there are no breaks in the electrical connections and that power poles are correctly placed."}
