{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully deployed on the map. The agent repeatedly attempted to work with a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but all placement and crafting operations failed due to a lack of lab inventory and missing sub-ingredients. Although operations involved retrieving furnace entities at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron smelting and at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper smelting, these interactions were part of resource\u2010processing procedures and did not result in any newly created, persistent structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, provide exactly the parameters expected by the function. Avoid using unexpected keywords like \u201cradius\u201d or supplying extra positional arguments.  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that any function expected to return an iterable is validated so that a \u201cNoneType\u201d is not mistakenly iterated over.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the required Lab item is present in inventory before attempting placement.  \n\u2003\u2013 Before initiating Lab crafting, check that all necessary sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are sufficiently available.  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that prerequisite processes (like smelting to produce essential plates) have fully completed to support sub-component production.\n\n\u2022 Resource Shortages During Crafting  \n\u2003\u2013 Monitor inventory levels closely and adjust smelting or resource conversion processes to prevent shortages that ultimately block lab crafting."}
