The logs indicate that no entities have been successfully placed, as the map remains empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is clear before attempting to place an entity. Check the surroundings to confirm that no other entities or obstacles are occupying the intended placement area.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect placement coordinates\n- Verify the coordinates before placing an entity to ensure they are within the valid map boundaries and not overlapping with existing structures or terrain features.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the agent's position\n- Move closer to the intended placement area to ensure the agent is within the required range for placing entities. This will help avoid errors related to distance constraints during placement.\n\nThese tips should help in avoiding common placement errors and facilitate successful construction of structures on the map."}
