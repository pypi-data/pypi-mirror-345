{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Copper Cable Factory (centered near Position(x=2.5, y=17.5))\nConsists of the production interface for converting copper plates into copper cable:\n\u2013 Cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n\u2013 Burner inserter (direction DOWN) at Position(x=1.5, y=17.5)\n\u2013 New factory burner inserter (direction RIGHT) at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) (placed in Step 211)\n\u2013 Burner inserter (direction UP) at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5)\n\u2013 Assembling machine \u201cassembling-machine-1\u201d at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5)\n\n###Belt Depot (anchored at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5))\nServes as the intermediary connection for transferring items from the extraction system to the cable factory:\n\u2013 Wooden chest (belt depot) at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) (crafted and placed in Step 214)\n\u2013 Transport belt segment at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) (placed in Step 215)\n\u2013 Depot burner inserter (using direction UP) at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) (placed in Step 216)\n\n###Extraction System Interface (located at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5))\nProvides the source of copper plates for downstream processing:\n\u2013 Extraction system burner inserter at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5) with drop position Position(x=-3.5, y=28.5)\n\n###Electricity Generator (centered at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5))\nImplements the steam\u2010powered energy production setup:\n\u2013 Steam engine (generator) at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)\n\u2013 Boiler at Position(x=-5.5, y=24.0)\n\u2013 Offshore pump at Position(x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2013 Belt Connection Target Error  \n\u2003\u2022 When connecting transport belts, do not target a steam engine directly. Instead, add and use an inserter to input items into the steam engine.\n\n\u2013 Placement Distance Error  \n\u2003\u2022 Ensure your position is within the allowed placement radius (max distance of 10 units) by moving closer to the intended target before placing an entity.\n\n\u2013 Inventory Availability Error  \n\u2003\u2022 Verify that the required item (for example, a wooden chest) is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2013 Variable Reference Error  \n\u2003\u2022 Check that all variables (such as the target entity\u2019s reference) are correctly defined to prevent NameError issues."}
