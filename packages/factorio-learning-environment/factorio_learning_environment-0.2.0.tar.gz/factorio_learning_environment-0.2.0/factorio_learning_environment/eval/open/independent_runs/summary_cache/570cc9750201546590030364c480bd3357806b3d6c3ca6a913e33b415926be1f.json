Overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts (notably around (8.0, 20.5) and (8.5, 22.5)) continue to obstruct clear buildable space.  \n - Despite resource availability (1 steam engine in inventory), the cluttered layout prevents installation.  \n - Mitigation recommendations:  \n   \u2022 Reevaluate the boiler zone and remove or reposition conflicting entities such as burner\u2011inserters and transport belts.  \n   \u2022 Adjust adjoining connection interfaces to free up adequate space for extra entity placement.  \n   \u2022 Consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested area or redesigning the boiler layout to eliminate the bottleneck."}
