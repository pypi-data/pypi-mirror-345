Here\u2019s the updated status:\n\n### Furnace Inventory Overview:\n- The furnace currently has **4 pieces of iron ore** and has produced **3 pieces of iron plates**.\n\n### Current Overall Inventory:\n- **5 pieces of stone furnaces**\n- **5 pieces of stone**\n- **5 pieces of iron ore** (remaining after insertion)\n- **20 pieces of copper ore**\n- **8 pieces of iron plates** (total in inventory)\n- **6 pieces of copper plates**\n- **20 pieces of copper cables**\n- **13 pieces of Iron Gear Wheels**\n\n### Furnace Status:\n- The furnace is now in a \"WORKING\" state, indicating it is processing the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Monitor the Furnace**: I should keep an eye on the furnace as it processes the iron ore into iron plates. Once it finishes, I can extract the plates and continue crafting.\n2. **Consider Crafting Other Components**: While waiting, I can also consider crafting other components that might be needed for the Assembling Machine or further production.\n\nLet\u2019s wait for the furnace to complete its current processing cycle, and then I will check the inventory again.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for the furnace to finish processing\nsleep(10)  # Allow time for the smelting process to complete\n\n# Check the inventory after waiting for the furnace to finish\nfinal_furnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(f\"Final furnace inventory after processing: {final_furnace_inventory}\")  # Check furnace contents\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states.", "summary_range": "[1-280]"}
