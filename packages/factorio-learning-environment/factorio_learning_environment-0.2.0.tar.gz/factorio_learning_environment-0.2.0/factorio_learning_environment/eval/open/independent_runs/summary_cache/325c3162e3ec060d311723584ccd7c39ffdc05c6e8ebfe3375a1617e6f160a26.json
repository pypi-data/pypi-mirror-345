{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) collecting coal output from the drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n- Additional Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) collecting iron ore from the drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-8.5, -48.5) and (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for collecting resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors Related to Inserter Operations\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items to prevent them from idling. This includes ensuring that the source chest or entity is not empty and that the inserter is correctly positioned to pick up items.\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients for smelting to avoid idle time. Regularly check the input inventory of furnaces and supply them with required resources.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the count of various items in the agent's possession.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents entities currently placed on the map, though specific data is omitted in logs."}
