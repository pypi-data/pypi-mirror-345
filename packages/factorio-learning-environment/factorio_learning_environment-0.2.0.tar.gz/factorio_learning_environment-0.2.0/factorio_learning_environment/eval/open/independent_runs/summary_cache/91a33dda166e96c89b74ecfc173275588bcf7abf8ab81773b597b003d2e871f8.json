Instead, add an inserter that feeds items into the intended target. This error recurred in Steps 210, 211, 213, 214, 215, 216, and 217.\n\u2013 Ensure you are within the allowed placement range when positioning an entity. The wooden chest placement errors (e.g. at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)) indicate that being too far from the target prevents placement.\n\u2013 Verify that all required inventory items are available before attempting placement. The error about \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d shows the need for prechecking inventory.\n\u2013 Confirm that all variables are properly defined to avoid undefined name errors (e.g. the NameError for \u2018target_chest\u2019)."}
