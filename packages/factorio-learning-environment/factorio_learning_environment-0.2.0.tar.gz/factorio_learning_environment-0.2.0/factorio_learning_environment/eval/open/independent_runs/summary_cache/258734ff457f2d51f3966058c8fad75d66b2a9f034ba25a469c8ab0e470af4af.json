{"content": "Here is the updated report based on the execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (41.0, -85.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -83.5) moving coal to storage\n- Wooden chest at (43.5, -83.5) storing coal (currently contains 326 coal)\n\n### Iron Production System 1 at (-20.0, -54.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-19.5, -52.5) for moving ore\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -54.0) for smelting iron plates\n\n### Iron Production System 2 at (-14.0, -56.0)  \nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-13.5, -54.5) for moving ore\n- Stone furnace at (-11.0, -56.0) for smelting iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing entities - check for existing objects or terrain restrictions\n- When placing entities next to each other, verify sufficient spacing and valid placement positions\n- Use appropriate spacing parameters when using place_entity_next_to() to avoid collisions\n\n### Belt Connection Errors\n- Cannot connect belts directly to furnaces - must use inserters to interface with furnaces\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in inventory before attempting to fuel machines\n- Keep coal reserves available for refueling mining drills and inserters\n\n### System Design Issues\n- Mining drills are getting blocked due to missing output handling - ensure proper item flow chain\n- Furnaces lacking ingredients indicates gaps in the logistics chain - verify complete path from ore to furnace\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places an entity at specific coordinates\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places an entity adjacent to another with specified spacing\n- connect_entities(): Creates belt connections between entities\n- insert_item(): Adds items to an entity's inventory\n\nImportant Variables:\n- coal_drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- chest1: Chest\n- inserter1, inserter2: BurnerInserter\n- drill1, drill2: BurnerMiningDrill\n- belts1: TransportBelt\n- furnace1, furnace2: Furnace"}
