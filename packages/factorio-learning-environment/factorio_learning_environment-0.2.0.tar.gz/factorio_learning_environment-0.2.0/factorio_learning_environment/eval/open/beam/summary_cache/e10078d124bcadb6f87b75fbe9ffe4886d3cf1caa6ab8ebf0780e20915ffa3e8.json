{"content": "The error message indicates that the furnace inventory is full, but the debug output shows that the furnace contents are empty (`{}`). This suggests that the issue might be related to the incorrect handling of the furnace's inventory or possibly the position of the furnace.\n\nHere are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Furnace Position**: Ensure that the furnace position is correctly specified and matches the actual position of the furnace in the game. If the position is incorrect, the script might be interacting with the wrong entity.\n\n2. **Check Inventory Types**: Ensure that the script is correctly accessing the furnace's input, output, and fuel inventories. There might be a misunderstanding of how the inventories are structured.\n\n3. **Debugging Outputs**: Add more detailed debug outputs to understand the state of the furnace and the actions being taken.\n\nLet's refine the code with these considerations:\n\n```python\ndef clear_furnace(furnace_position: Position):\n    \"\"\"\n    Clears the furnace's output and fuel slots to ensure space is available.\n    \"\"\"\n    furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace_position)\n    if furnace:\n        output_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace)\n        print(f\"Clearing furnace at {furnace_position}, current contents: {output_inventory}\")  # Debugging output\n\n        # Remove items from the output slot\n        for item_name, quantity in output_inventory.items():\n            item_prototype = prototype_by_name[item_name]\n            if quantity > 0:\n                extract_item(item_prototype, furnace.position, quantity)\n        \n        # Check fuel slot as well\n        fuel_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace, inventory_type='fuel')\n        print(f\"Fuel inventory before clearing: {fuel_inventory}\")  # Debugging output\n        if fuel_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) > 0:\n            extract_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace.position, fuel_inventory[Prototype.Coal])\n        \n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef ensure_coal_inserted(furnace_position: Position):\n    \"\"\"\n    Ensures that coal is inserted into the furnace for smelting.
