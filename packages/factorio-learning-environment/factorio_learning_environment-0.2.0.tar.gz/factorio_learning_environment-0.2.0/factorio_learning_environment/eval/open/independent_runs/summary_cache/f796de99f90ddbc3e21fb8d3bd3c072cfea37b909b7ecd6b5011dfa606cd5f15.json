{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at position(x=35-41, y=-83 to -87)\nComplex mining setup consisting of:\n- 4 Burner mining drills positioned at (41.0,-86.0), (37.0,-85.0), (39.0,-85.0), (41.0,-83.0)\n- Wooden chests for coal collection at (36.5,-86.5), (40.5,-87.5), (39.5,-83.5)\n- Burner inserters at (35.5,-86.5), (35.5,-85.5) for coal movement\nAll drills are currently out of fuel but positioned over coal resources\n\n### Iron/Copper Ore Processing at position(x=-28, y=-61)\nMining and smelting setup with:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0,-61.0) mining iron and copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5,-59.5) collecting ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0,-58.0) for smelting\n- Burner inserters at (-26.5,-59.5), (-25.5,-58.5) moving materials\n- Output chest at (-24.5,-58.5) collecting plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(x=-10 to -6, y=-59)\nThree burner mining drills at:\n- (-10.0,-59.0)\n- (-8.0,-59.0)\n- (-6.0,-59.0)\nConnected by transport belts and inserters to wooden chests at (-9.5,-57.5), (-7.5,-57.5), (-5.5,-57.5)\n\n### Smelting Array at position(x=0 to 6, y=0)\nFour furnace setup with:\n- Stone furnaces at (0.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), (4.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0)\n- Input inserters and chests above furnaces\n- Output inserters and chests below furnaces\n- Connected by transport belts for material movement\n\n### Power Generation at position(x=4.5, y=20.5)\nSteam power setup with:\n- Steam engine at (4.5,20.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5,22.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5,27.5)\n- Connected by pipe network\n- Small electric pole network connecting to lab\n\n### Research Lab\nSingle lab connected to power network, currently not researching\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Crafting errors\n- Ensure required ingredients are available in inventory before attempting to craft items\n- Check recipe requirements before initiating crafting operations\n\n### Resource extraction errors\n- Must be within interaction range of target chest/entity when attempting to extract items\n- Verify chest contains requested items before attempting extraction\n\n### Entity operation errors\n- Burner entities (drills, inserters) require fuel to operate\n- Many entities showing \"out of fuel\" warnings - ensure coal supply is maintained\n- Some inserters waiting for source items - check input supply chains\n\n### Fluid system warnings\n- Steam engine showing \"no input liquid\" - ensure proper pipe connections and water supply\n- Verify fluid connections between offshore pump, boiler and steam engine"}
