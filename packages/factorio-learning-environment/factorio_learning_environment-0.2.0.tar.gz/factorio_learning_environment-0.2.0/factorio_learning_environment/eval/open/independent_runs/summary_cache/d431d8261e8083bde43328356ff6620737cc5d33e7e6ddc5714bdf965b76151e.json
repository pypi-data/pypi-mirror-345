{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, currently processing copper ore.\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) connected to power, awaiting source items.\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) connected to power, awaiting source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5) for item storage.\n\n### Electricity Generation Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) connected to a water source.\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 27.0) fueled with coal, connected to the offshore pump.\n- Offshore Pump at position (0.5, 30.5) not connected to any fluid system.\n- Boiler at position (4.5, 31.0) not connected to any fluid system or steam engine.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-7.5, 24.5) connected to the offshore pump and boiler, carrying water.\n- Multiple other PipeGroups at various positions, currently empty and not connected to any active fluid systems.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (14.5, 1.5), (-4.5, 7.5), (-0.5, 3.5), and others, currently not delivering power due to connection issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe and Steam Engine Connections\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that may prevent successful connections.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities at a Distance\n- Move closer to the intended placement position of an entity, such as a steam engine, to ensure it is within the maximum allowable distance for placement.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Insufficient Materials\n- Ensure you have all required materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. Check the crafting requirements and gather necessary resources beforehand.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Electricity Network\n- Verify that all components of the electricity network are properly connected and that there are no placement blockages preventing connections between poles and other entities.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Entities\n- Confirm that the target entity, such as a furnace, contains the items you wish to extract. Ensure the entity is operational and has the expected output.\n\n### Errors in Using API with Incorrect Types\n- Review the API documentation to ensure that the correct data types are used when calling functions, especially when dealing with entity dimensions and positions."}
