Regularly check and refill the source entities to prevent idle inserters.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of connected drills or assemblers. This will prevent stoppages in production lines.\n\n### Furnaces with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to process. Monitor and maintain the supply chain to prevent furnaces from running out of ingredients to smelt."}
