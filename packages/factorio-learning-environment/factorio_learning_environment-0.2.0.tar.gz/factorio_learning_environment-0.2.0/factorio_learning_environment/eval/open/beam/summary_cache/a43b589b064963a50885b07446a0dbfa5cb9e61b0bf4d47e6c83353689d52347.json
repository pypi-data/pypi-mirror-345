We need to smelt the 5 iron ore into iron plates using the stone furnace.\n2. Since we already have one stone furnace on the map, we can use that to smelt the iron ore.\n\nLet's place the stone furnace at a suitable position and insert the iron ore along with some wood for fuel.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to the position of the existing stone furnace to use it\nfurnace_position = Position(x=-1.0, y=2.0)  # Position of the operational furnace\n\n# Insert wood as fuel and iron ore into the working furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Wood, furnace_position, quantity=3)  # Insert some wood as fuel\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace_position, quantity=5)  # Insert all iron ore for smelting\n\n# Check inventory after setting up the furnace again\nprint(f\"Inventory after setting up the furnace: {inspect_inventory()}\") \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check the state of the entities again\n", "summary_range": "[1-32]"}
