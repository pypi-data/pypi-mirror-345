{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis facility is used for extracting iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into the wooden chest. The burner inserter moves the iron ore from the chest into the stone furnace, where it is smelted into iron plates.\n\n#### Coal and Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis facility is used for extracting coal and processing iron ore. The burner mining drill extracts coal and deposits it into the wooden chest. The burner inserter moves iron ore into the stone furnace, where it is smelted into iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors When Inserting Items Without Available Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to inserting items that are not available in the inventory.\n\n#### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. For example, the chest at drop position (41.5, -80.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n#### Errors Due to No Ingredients for Smelting\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) has a warning for no ingredients to smelt, indicating that it needs more iron ore to continue production."}
