{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-2.5, -0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position(-9.5, -0.5)), boiler (position(-7.0, -0.5)) and steam engine (position(-2.5, -0.5))\n\n### Coal mining operation at position(16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position(16.0, 0.0)), wooden chest (position(16.5, 1.5)) and burner inserter (position(18.5, 1.5))\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before using them. For example, 'offshore_pump' should be defined before being used in the 'place_entity_next_to' function.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a Prototype.WoodenChest object as a source. You need to add an inserter that takes items from Prototype.WoodenChest and use the inserter as a source entity.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n### Important Variables\n- offshore_pump: OffshorePump (not explicitly defined but used in the code)\n- boiler: Boiler (not explicitly defined but used in the code)\n- steam_engine: Generator (not explicitly defined but used in the code)\n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs."}
