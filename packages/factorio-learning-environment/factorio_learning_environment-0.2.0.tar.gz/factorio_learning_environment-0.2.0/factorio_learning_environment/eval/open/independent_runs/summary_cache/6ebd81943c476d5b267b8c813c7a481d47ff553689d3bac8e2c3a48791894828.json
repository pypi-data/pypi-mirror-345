{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the current report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at (-82, -80)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN, mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) moving items from belt\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -80.0) facing UP\n\nThe system is partially operational:\n- Mining drill is working and has coal fuel\n- Chest is collecting coal (currently 750)\n- First inserter is waiting due to blocked belt\n- Second inserter is waiting due to blocked output\n- Furnace has no ingredients but has full fuel\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Rotation Issues\n- Cannot rotate certain entities like stone-furnace - verify entity supports rotation before attempting\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, check for:\n  - Sufficient spacing\n  - No collisions with existing entities or items on ground\n  - Valid placement surface (not water)\n  - Correct relative positioning\n\n### Belt System Blockages\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to feed more items\n- Ensure there is a valid output/sink for items at the end of transport systems\n- Remove items on ground that may be blocking inserter outputs\n\n### System Design Issues\n- Furnace system lacks proper input/output connections causing blockages\n- Transport belt system needs proper item sinks to prevent backups\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- rotate_entity(entity, direction) -> Fails for stone-furnace\n- place_entity_next_to(entity, reference_pos, spacing, direction) -> Fails when collision detected\n\nVariables:\n- furnace: Entity (stone-furnace)\n- furnace_position: Position(x,y)\n- furnace_direction: Direction"}
