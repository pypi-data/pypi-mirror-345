{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace 1 at position (-14.0, -49.0) and Furnace 2 at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) feeding Furnace 1\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) feeding Furnace 2\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) for storing iron plates\n- Belt Group connecting furnaces to the iron chest\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple transport belts connecting various entities, including:\n  - Belt from position (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5)\n  - Belt from position (-8.5, -45.5) to (-8.5, -43.5)\n  - Belt from position (-16.5, -49.5) to (-16.5, -47.5)\n  - Belt from position (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -47.5)\n  - Belt from position (-13.5, -46.5) to (-11.5, -46.5)\n  - Belt from position (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -43.5)\n  - Belt from position (-13.5, -45.5) to (-11.5, -45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter at position (-11.5, -45.5) has a clear path to drop items into a valid destination. Check for blockages or missing entities that can accept the inserter's output.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnaces\n- Verify that the stone furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) contains the expected items before attempting extraction. Ensure the furnace is operational and has processed materials.\n\n### Inventory Management for Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert items like coal into entities, confirm that the inventory contains the necessary items to complete the action."}
