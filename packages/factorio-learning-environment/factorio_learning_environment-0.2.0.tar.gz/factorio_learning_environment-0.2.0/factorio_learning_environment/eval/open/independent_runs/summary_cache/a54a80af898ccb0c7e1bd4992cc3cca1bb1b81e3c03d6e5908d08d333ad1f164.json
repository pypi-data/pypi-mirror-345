{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is not connected to any power source and the boiler is out of fuel, indicating that the generator is currently non-operational.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nThe lab is currently not receiving power and cannot operate.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nThe assembling machine is not receiving electricity and cannot create automation-science-pack due to missing resources.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups that connect various entities, with one working fluid system (fluid system 46246) that is currently operational.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting power sources\n- Ensure that the steam engine and boiler are connected to an operational power source to avoid the \"No operational power sources found to connect to\" error.\n\n### Errors with boiler fuel\n- Make sure to have coal or another fuel type in inventory to refuel the boiler. Check inventory before attempting to refuel.\n\n### Errors with boiler operation\n- If the boiler is still not operational after refueling, verify that it is connected to a water source and that there are no blockages in the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors with assembling machine resources\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has the necessary resources (copper-plate and iron-gear-wheel) in inventory to create the desired product.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
