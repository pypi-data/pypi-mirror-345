For example, ensure a wooden chest exists at the specified position before trying to extract from it.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure you have coal in your inventory before trying to insert it into a boiler."}
