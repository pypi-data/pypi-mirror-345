Returns a list of connected entities.\n    - Success mode: Entities are connected successfully.\n    - Failure mode: Entities are not connected due to incorrect prototype or entities not being adjacent, or source entity not having the required fluid.\n  - `get_entity(prototype, position)`: Retrieves an entity of the given prototype at the specified position. Returns the entity if found.\n    - Success mode: Entity is retrieved successfully.\n    - Failure mode: Entity is not found at the specified position, resulting in an Exception.\n  - `place_entity(prototype, position, direction)`: Places an entity of the given prototype at the specified position and direction.\n    - Success mode: Entity is placed successfully.\n    - Failure mode: Entity is not placed due to the target position being too far away, occupied, or unplaceable. \n  - `place_entity_next_to(prototype, position, direction, spacing)`: Places an entity of the given prototype next to the specified position with the given direction and spacing.\n    - Success mode: Entity is placed successfully.\n    - Failure mode: Entity is not placed due to collisions with existing entities or insufficient space. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction."}
