{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for coal extraction.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) for transferring coal from position (x=53.5, y=-83.5) to position (x=55.5, y=-83.5).\n- BeltGroup for transporting coal, consisting of belts from (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5) and (x=49.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) currently empty.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure that you have gathered all necessary materials before attempting to craft items like automation science packs. Check your inventory for required ingredients such as copper plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Coal\n- Make sure you are positioned correctly and that the target entity is accessible before attempting to extract coal.\n\n### No Ores Available to Smelt\n- Verify that there are ores available in the furnace or nearby chests before attempting to smelt. Ensure the supply chain is intact and ores are being transported to the furnace.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production. Check the fuel status and replenish coal as needed.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Ensure there is a continuous flow of resources by managing storage effectively."}
