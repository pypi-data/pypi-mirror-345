{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent attempted several placements, but no entities were successfully placed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type before attempting placement.\n- Verify that there are no global restrictions or settings preventing placement. Consider reviewing game settings or permissions that might affect placement capabilities.\n- When encountering persistent placement issues, confirm that the entity is being placed within a buildable area and that there are no hidden constraints affecting placement.\n\n### Errors related to map-wide restrictions\n- Investigate any map-wide restrictions that could be affecting the ability to place entities. This might involve checking for any game rules or settings that could be limiting placement options.\n\n### Errors due to potential hidden constraints\n- If placement fails due to hidden constraints, consider examining the environment or map settings to identify any underlying issues that might not be immediately visible."}
