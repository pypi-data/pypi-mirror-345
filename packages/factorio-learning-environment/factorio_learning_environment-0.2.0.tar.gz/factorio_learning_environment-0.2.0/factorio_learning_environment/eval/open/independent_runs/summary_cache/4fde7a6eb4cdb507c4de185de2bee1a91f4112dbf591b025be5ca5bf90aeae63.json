{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (Position x=0.0, y=0.0 and x=2.0, y=0.0)\nTwo stone furnaces working in parallel to produce iron plates:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0) with coal fuel system (28 coal) and iron ore input (13 ore, 22 plates)\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) with coal fuel system (25 coal) and iron ore input (13 ore, 22 plates)\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position x=4.0, y=4.0)\nSingle stone furnace setup:\n- Furnace at (4,4) with coal fuel system (32 coal) for copper plate production\n- Currently idle due to lack of ingredients\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Assembly Line (Position x=6.5-12.5, y=11.5)\nAutomated assembly system consisting of:\n- Input wooden chest at (6.5,11.5) currently empty\n- Burner inserter at (7.5,11.5) with 13 coal fuel\n- Assembling machine at (9.5,11.5) crafting iron gear wheels (low on iron plates)\n- Output burner inserter at (11.5,11.5) with 14 coal fuel\n- Output wooden chest at (12.5,11.5) storing 15 iron gear wheels\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=-9.5 to -2.5, y=22.5-24.5)\nSteam-based power plant:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,24.5) extracting water\n- Pipe network connecting water flow\n- Boiler at (-7.0,24.5) converting water to steam (4 coal remaining)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5,24.5) generating electricity\n- Electric pole network distributing power across multiple positions\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Lab Entity Access Errors\n- The agent is repeatedly trying to access a lab at various positions (x=-2.5 y=22.5, x=0.5 y=26.5, etc) but failing\n- Ensure the lab exists at the specified position before attempting to access it\n- Consider maintaining a consistent lab position throughout the code\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Monitor iron ore inventory before attempting to insert into furnaces\n- Keep track of assembly machine input resources to prevent ingredient shortages\n- Current issues with iron plate shortage in assembling machine\n\n### Entity Position Errors\n- Multiple attempts to find lab at different positions indicate confusion about lab placement\n- Maintain consistent entity positions in the code\n- Verify entity positions before attempting operations\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- Copper furnace is idle due to lack of ingredients\n- Monitor and maintain resource supply chains\n- Ensure regular refueling of burner inserters and boilers"}
