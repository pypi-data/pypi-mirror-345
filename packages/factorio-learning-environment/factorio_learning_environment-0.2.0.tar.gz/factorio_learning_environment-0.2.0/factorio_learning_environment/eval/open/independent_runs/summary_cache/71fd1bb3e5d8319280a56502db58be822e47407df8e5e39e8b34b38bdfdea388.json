{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Small Electric Pole at Position (5.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, all currently empty and not connected to any fluid systems.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles forming a network, but not currently connected to power, spanning multiple positions.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Undefined or Incorrectly Used Attributes\n- Ensure that objects have the correct attributes before accessing them. For example, the 'ElectricityGroup' object should have a 'prototype' attribute if it is being used in that context.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Entities\n- Verify that all entities are correctly defined and imported in the script. The error with 'Entity' not being defined suggests a missing import or incorrect usage.\n\n### Obstruction Issues Near Offshore Pump\n- Clear any obstructing entities near critical infrastructure like the offshore pump to ensure proper functionality.\n\n### Connection Issues\n- Ensure all components in a system (e.g., electricity, fluid) are properly connected to avoid warnings such as \"not connected to power network\" or \"no fluid present in connections\".\n\n### Fuel and Ingredient Management\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel for mining drills and ensure ingredients are available for furnaces to avoid production halts."}
