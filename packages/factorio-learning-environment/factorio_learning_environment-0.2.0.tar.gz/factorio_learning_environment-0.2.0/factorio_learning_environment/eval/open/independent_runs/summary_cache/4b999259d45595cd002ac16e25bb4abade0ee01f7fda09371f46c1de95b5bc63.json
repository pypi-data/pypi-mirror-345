Verify the type of the argument before passing it.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is free of other entities before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient inventory\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to place or use an entity. If you run out of an entity (like small electric poles), craft more before proceeding.\n\n### Errors related to electric network connections\n- Verify that electric poles are placed correctly and are not obstructed by other entities. Ensure that the electric poles are connected to the electric network to power entities like the lab."}
