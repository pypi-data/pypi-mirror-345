{"content": "I notice several key things:\n\n1. We successfully crafted the burner mining drill\n2. The drill was placed but shows NO_FUEL status despite adding coal\n3. There's a warning about needing space in the destination\n\nLet's fix this:\n\n```python\n# First check our current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Place a chest next to where the drill will output\nchest = place_entity(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    position=Position(x=-18.5, y=21.5)\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at: {chest.position}\")\n\n# Now place the mining drill\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=Position(x=-17.5, y=20.5),\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed mining drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Add coal to power the drill\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to mining drill\")\n\n# Check our setup\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Create space for the output with a chest\n2. Place the drill in the correct position\n3. Add fuel to get it running\n4. Verify it's working properly\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to try this approach.", "summary_range": "[1-2624]"}
