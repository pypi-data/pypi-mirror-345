Regularly empty chests or use inserters to transfer items to other storage or processing units.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Supply Chain\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items and are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure that the source and destination entities have available space for items.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Supply\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to prevent them from stopping due to a lack of ingredients."}
