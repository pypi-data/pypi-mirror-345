To resolve this, use an inserter that inputs items into the steam engine rather than connecting the belt directly.\n\u2022 Placement Distance Problems \u2013 Placement attempts for entities such as wooden chests failed when the player was too far from the target point. Ensure the player is within the maximum allowed range (\u224810 units) before placing an entity.\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Errors \u2013 A NameError arose from referencing an undefined variable (e.g. \u201ctarget_chest\u201d). Verify that all variables are properly defined and referenced.\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage \u2013 Placement failures occurred because required items (for example, a wooden chest) were not present in the inventory. Confirm that the necessary items are available before proceeding with placement operations."}
