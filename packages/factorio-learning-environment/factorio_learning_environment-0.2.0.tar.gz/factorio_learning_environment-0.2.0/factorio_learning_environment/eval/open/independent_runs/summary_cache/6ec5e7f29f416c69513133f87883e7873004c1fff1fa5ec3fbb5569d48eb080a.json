{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter Pickup and Drop Positions\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source entity (chest) and the drop position is aligned with the target entity (furnace). Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. If an entity already exists at the intended position, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Refueling Errors Due to Inventory Shortage\n- Maintain an adequate supply of fuel (such as coal) in your inventory to ensure continuous operation of fuel-dependent entities like burner inserters and mining drills. Regularly check and replenish fuel supplies to prevent operational interruptions.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to transfer materials into the furnace. Check for any misalignment or obstruction that might prevent the inserter from functioning properly."}
