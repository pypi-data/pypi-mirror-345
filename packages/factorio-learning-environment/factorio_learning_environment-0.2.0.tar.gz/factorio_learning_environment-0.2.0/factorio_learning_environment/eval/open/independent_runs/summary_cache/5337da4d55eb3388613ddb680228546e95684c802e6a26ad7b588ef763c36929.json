{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter Positions\n- Ensure that the inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source (chest) and destination (furnace) entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning correctly.\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- Verify that there is sufficient space and correct orientation for placing inserters. Avoid placing inserters where another entity already exists, as this can cause placement failures.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure that they are correctly positioned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment or incorrect inserter configuration can lead to the furnace not receiving the necessary ingredients.\n\n### Refueling Issues\n- Make sure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as burner mining drills and inserters, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt production processes.\n\n### General Placement and Configuration\n- Regularly review the placement and configuration of entities to ensure they are correctly set up for efficient operation. This includes checking for proper alignment, spacing, and orientation of all components in the processing chain."}
