{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with coal and iron ore as inputs, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 1.5) containing 50 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 3.5) containing 50 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 5.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance to place an entity is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required ingredients\n- Gather the necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is required to craft a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without unlocking the recipe\n- Research the necessary technologies before attempting to craft items that require them. For instance, the steel chest requires the steel-processing technology to be researched first.\n\n### Errors when trying to place an entity in an occupied tile\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity there."}
