{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52, -82)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) with coal as fuel, working status, and a drop position at (52.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing mined coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal with 615 units.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12, -51)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) with coal as fuel, working status, and a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel, currently with no ingredients to smelt, but with 86 iron plates stored.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore, currently holding 1 unit.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items, connected to the chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Several inserters at positions (52.5, -79.5), (52.5, -76.5), (-11.5, -48.5), (-8.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -46.5) are waiting for source items. Ensure that the source chests or entities have items available for transfer. Check for blockages or ensure that the input side of the inserters is correctly aligned with the source.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- The chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) is full, preventing the burner mining drill at (-12.0, -51.0) from continuing mining. Regularly empty the chest to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- The stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) is without ingredients to smelt. Ensure a continuous supply of iron ore to the furnace to maintain production of iron plates.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'. Current values: {'wooden-chest': 3, 'wood': 10, 'coal': 555, 'iron-ore': 1173, 'iron-plate': 1165}."}
