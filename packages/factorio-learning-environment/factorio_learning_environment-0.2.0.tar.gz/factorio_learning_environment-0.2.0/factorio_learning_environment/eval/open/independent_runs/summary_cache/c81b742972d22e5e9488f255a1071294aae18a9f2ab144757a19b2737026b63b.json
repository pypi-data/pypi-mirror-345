{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x)\nConsists of steam engine (position x=10, y=0), boiler (position not specified), and offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=24.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace (position y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace (position y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace (position y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace (position y1)\n- Assembling machine at position (z1) and inserter at position (a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position (z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure there are no blocking entities at the target location before attempting to place an electric pole. If the terrain is unplaceable (e.g., water), choose a different location.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Make sure the steam engine is within range and operational before attempting to insert coal. Verify that there are no nearby entities that can accept coal.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure that the specified position for retrieving an entity is correct and that the entity exists at that position. Double-check the coordinates and the type of entity you are trying to access."}
