{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. The agent made several attempts to establish a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to research; however, placement and crafting failures (due to missing inventory and insufficient resources) prevented the Lab from being established. In addition, while smelting operations were carried out using furnaces located at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron and Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper, these facilities were pre-existing and not newly constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Misuse in get_entities Calls\n\u2003- Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u2018radius\u2019) and extra positional arguments. Ensure that the function call strictly matches the defined signature.\n\u2022 Iteration on Nonexistent Entity Lists\n\u2003- Check that the result from get_entities (or equivalent functions) is not None before attempting to iterate or filter the returned data.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n\u2003- Verify the availability of a Lab in inventory before attempting its placement.\n\u2003- Confirm that all prerequisite sub-ingredients (e.g., iron-plate required for iron-gear-wheel, copper-plate for copper-cable, electronic-circuit components, etc.) are sufficiently available before initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2022 Resource Shortages Affecting Production\n\u2003- Ensure that the supply chain (including smelting operations and component production) meets the required resource quota to support complex builds such as the Lab."}
