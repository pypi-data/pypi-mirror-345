Verify the function signature and provide only the permitted arguments.  \n\u2022 Lab Placement Verification \u2013 Attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed due to its absence in the inventory; always confirm that the required item is available before placement.  \n\u2022 Defensive Iteration \u2013 An error arose from iterating over a None value (when get_entities returned None). Use a default empty list or check for None prior to iteration to avoid such type errors.  \n\u2022 Resource Chain Completeness \u2013 Lab crafting repeatedly failed because of missing sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable). Ensure that every component in the production chain is sufficiently available and that prerequisite resources are processed through the proper smelting or crafting facilities before attempting to craft complex items."}
