The furnace inventory should have enough space to accommodate the items being inserted.\n- Before attempting to insert items, verify that the correct item type is being inserted into the furnace. For example, do not attempt to insert iron plates into a furnace that already contains iron ore.\n- Check that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure you have coal in your inventory before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors with Crafting\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in your inventory before attempting to craft an item.
