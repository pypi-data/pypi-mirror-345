{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) (Status: WORKING)\n- Steam engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Pipe groups connecting various points, including:\n  - Pipe group at position (-9.5, 23.5) (Status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n  - Pipe group at position (-7.5, 24.5) (Status: EMPTY)\n  - Pipe group at position (-5.5, 24.5) (Status: EMPTY)\n  - Pipe group at position (-4.5, 16.5) (Status: EMPTY)\n  - Pipe group at position (-4.5, 24.5) (Status: EMPTY)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) (Status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715) (Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing or Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes is clear of existing objects and is not over water or unplaceable terrain. Consider adjusting the placement location to avoid these issues.\n- When attempting to connect pipes, verify that the connection path is valid and that the pipes are correctly aligned with each other.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients or Fuel\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to function. Check the inventory and supply the required materials.\n- Make sure that the boiler has the necessary fuel to operate. Check and supply the appropriate fuel type.\n\n### Errors When Crafting Items\n- When crafting items like underground pipes, ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available. For example, iron plates need to be smelted in a furnace or crafted in a machine before use.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Network Connection\n- Verify that all components of the electricity network are correctly connected. Ensure that the electricity group is plugged into the network to provide power to the connected entities."}
