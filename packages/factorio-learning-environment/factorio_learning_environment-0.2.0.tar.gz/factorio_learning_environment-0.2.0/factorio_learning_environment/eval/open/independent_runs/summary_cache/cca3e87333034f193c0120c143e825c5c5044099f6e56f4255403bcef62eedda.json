This facility has been employed to boost the available iron plates needed for subsequent crafting processes, particularly as a prerequisite for lab production.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of a furnace entity dedicated to processing copper ore and coal into copper plates. This structure supports the production chain by providing copper plates, which are essential for fabricating components such as copper cables and other sub-ingredients.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval\n  - Avoid supplying unsupported keyword arguments (for example, do not pass a \u2018radius\u2019 parameter to get_entities).\n  - Use the correct calling convention so that the number of positional arguments matches the function\u2019s specification.\n\n\u2022 Entity placement and iteration issues\n  - Verify that required items (e.g. a lab) are present in the inventory before attempting to place them on the map.\n  - Ensure that functions returning lists are properly checked or defaulted (for instance, replace a None result with an empty list) before iterating over them.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient resource chains for advanced crafting\n  - Confirm that all prerequisite ingredients for complex items (such as labs) are available. Missing sub-components like iron-plates required for iron-gear-wheels or copper-plates needed for copper cables must be addressed before crafting.\n  - Establish and maintain a consistent production flow (via smelting or other processes) so that the crafting recipes for advanced structures are fully supported by the available resources."}
