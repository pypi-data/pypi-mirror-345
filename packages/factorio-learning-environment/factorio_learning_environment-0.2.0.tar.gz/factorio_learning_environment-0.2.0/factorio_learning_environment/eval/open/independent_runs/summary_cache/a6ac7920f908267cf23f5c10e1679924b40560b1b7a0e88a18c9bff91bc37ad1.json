{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Three Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Iron ore is regularly transferred to these furnaces from nearby storage chests.\n- Furnaces are refueled with coal to maintain operation.\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System at Position (47.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Iron Chests at positions (47.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at position (43.5, -80.5) for transferring coal between chests and furnaces.\n- A Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for mining coal, connected to a Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Area at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- A Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- Several Iron Chests and Wooden Chests for storing mined iron ore.\n- The drill is refueled with coal to ensure continuous operation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests at drop positions are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting. For example, the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Verify that inserters have a clear path and are properly fueled to ensure they can transfer items efficiently. Refuel inserters regularly, as seen with the inserter at (43.5, -80.5).\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to smelt. Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) require a steady input of iron ore to avoid idle time."}
