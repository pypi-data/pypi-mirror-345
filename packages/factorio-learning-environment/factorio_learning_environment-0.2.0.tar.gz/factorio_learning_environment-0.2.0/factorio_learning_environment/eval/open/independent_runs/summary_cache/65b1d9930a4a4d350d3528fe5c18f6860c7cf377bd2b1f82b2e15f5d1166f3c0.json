{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing additional coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or missing items.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or missing items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or missing items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or missing items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the source items they are supposed to transfer. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n- Verify that the inserters are correctly positioned and configured to pick up items from the correct source.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are used as drop positions for mining drills to prevent stoppages in resource extraction.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n- `wood`: int = 10\n- `coal`: int = 1240\n- `iron-ore`: int = 1382\n- `iron-plate`: int = 1265"}
