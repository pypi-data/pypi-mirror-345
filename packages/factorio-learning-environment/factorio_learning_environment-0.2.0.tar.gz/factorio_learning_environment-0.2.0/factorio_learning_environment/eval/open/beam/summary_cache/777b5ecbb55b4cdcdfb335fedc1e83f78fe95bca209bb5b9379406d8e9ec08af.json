{"content": "The repeated output of \"Starting detailed diagnostic procedure...\" without further progress suggests that the script is not advancing past the initial stages. This could be due to several potential issues, such as the failure to retrieve entities, an exception being raised, or the script not executing beyond the initial print statement. Here are some steps and tips to help diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n### Steps to Diagnose the Issue\n\n1. **Ensure Entity Retrieval**: Verify that the `get_entities` function is correctly retrieving entities from the game world. If the world is not set up with the required entities, the script will not proceed.\n\n2. **Add Debugging Statements**: Insert additional print statements immediately after each `get_entities` call to confirm that entities are being retrieved. For example:\n   ```python\n   print(f\"Offshore Pumps found: {len(offshore_pumps)}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Exceptions**: Ensure that any exceptions are being caught and printed. If an exception is occurring, it might be stopping the script early. Verify that the exception handling is set up to catch and display errors.\n\n4. **Validate Environment Setup**: Double-check that the Factorio environment is set up correctly with all necessary entities. If entities are missing, the assertions will fail, preventing further execution.\n\n5. **Review Assertion Logic**: Ensure that the assertions are correctly checking for the presence of entities. If any assertion fails, it will stop the script.\n\n### Example Debugging Pattern\n\nHere is an example pattern to help identify where the script might be failing:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting detailed diagnostic procedure...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Retrieve entities\n    offshore_pumps = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    print(f\"Offshore Pumps found: {len(offshore_pumps)}\")\n\n    boilers = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    print(f\"Boilers found: {len(boilers)}\")\n\n    steam_engines = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    print(f\"Steam Engines found: {len(steam_engines)}\")\n\n    electric_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    print(f\"Electric Poles found: {len(electric_poles)}\")\n\n    assembling_machines = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n    print(f\"Assembling Machines found: {len(assembling_machines)}\")\n\n    # Assertions to ensure all entities are present\n    assert offshore_pumps, \"No Offshore Pumps found!\"\n    assert boilers, \"No Boilers found!\"\n    assert steam_engines, \"No Steam Engines found!\"\n    assert electric_poles, \"No Electric Poles found!\"\n    assert assembling_machines, \"No Assembling Machines found!\"\n\n    # Proceed with operations if all entities are present\n    # (The rest of the script continues here...)\n\nexcept AssertionError as ae:\n    print(f\"Entity Retrieval Assertion Error: {ae}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Unexpected Execution Error: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Tips for Success\n\n- **Incremental Testing**: Test each part of the script incrementally to ensure that each section works before moving on to the next.\n- **Environment Verification**: Regularly verify that the game environment is correctly set up with the necessary entities.\n- **Use Logging**: Consider using a logging mechanism to capture detailed execution flow and errors, which can be helpful for debugging.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing the script from progressing beyond the initial print statement.", "summary_range": "[1-334]"}
