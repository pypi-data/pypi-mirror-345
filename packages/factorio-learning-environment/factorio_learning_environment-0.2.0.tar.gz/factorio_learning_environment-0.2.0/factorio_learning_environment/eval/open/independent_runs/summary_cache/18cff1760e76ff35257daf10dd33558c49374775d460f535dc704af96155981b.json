{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) storing coal (1600 units)\n- Iron chest at (41.5, -84.5) storing coal (1600 units)\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal (800 units)\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around x=45-47, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input wooden chest at (45.5, -79.5) containing iron ore\n- Output wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing iron plates (1500 units)\n- Three burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (44.5, -79.5) feeding first furnace\n  - Second inserter at (46.5, -79.5) feeding second furnace\n  - Output inserter at (48.5, -80.5) moving plates to storage\n- Empty wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing new entities\n- Check for existing entities that might block placement\n- Verify entity positions before attempting to interact with them\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Coal mining system is backing up due to full storage chests\n- Consider implementing a more efficient coal distribution system\n- Empty chests regularly to prevent mining stoppage\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Furnaces lack ingredients despite having fuel\n- Ensure proper inserter orientation for material flow\n- Verify input/output chest positions relative to inserters\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter\n\nFunctions Observed:\n- place_entity(): Places entities, fails when location is occupied\n- get_entity(): Retrieves entity at specified position, fails if entity doesn't exist\n\nStatus Variables:\n- EntityStatus.NO_FUEL: Indicates entity needs fuel\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Indicates processing machine lacks materials\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Indicates inserter waiting for items to move\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Indicates normal operation"}
