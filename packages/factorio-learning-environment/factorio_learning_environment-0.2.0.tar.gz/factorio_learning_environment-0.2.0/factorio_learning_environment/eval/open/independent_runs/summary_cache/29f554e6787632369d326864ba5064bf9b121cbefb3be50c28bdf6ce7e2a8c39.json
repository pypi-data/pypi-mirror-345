However, it is essential to ensure that the agent can place entities on the map without any obstacles or other entities occupying the same space.\n### Errors when extracting items from furnace\n- No errors were found in the given execution logs. However, it is crucial to ensure that the agent can extract items from the furnace without any issues, such as the furnace being empty or the agent not having enough space in its inventory."}
