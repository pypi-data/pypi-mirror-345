{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for extracting iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the adjacent chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily store extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at Positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0): Smelt iron ore into iron plates. The furnace at (-12.0, -48.0) is currently operational, while the furnace at (-10.0, -48.0) is waiting for ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserters** at Positions (-14.5, -47.5), (-11.5, -46.5), and (-11.5, -45.5): Manage the transfer of materials between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-14.5, -46.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-3.5, -48.5): Store iron plates produced by the furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of source items to avoid idle time. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady flow of resources to the inserters.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Make sure that the furnaces are continuously supplied with the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to keep them operational. This involves ensuring that the inserters are functioning correctly and transferring materials as needed.\n\n### Refueling Burner Entities\n- Regularly check and refuel burner entities such as mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production."}
