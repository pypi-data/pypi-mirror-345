{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. The agent attempted to place various entities, but all placement attempts failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest, Stone Furnace, Inserters, and Output Chest:** Ensure that the target location is unoccupied and suitable for the intended entity. Verify that the position is within the buildable area and adjust the placement coordinates if necessary.\n\n### Errors with movement commands\n- **Error moving to target areas:** Ensure that the position data used in movement commands is correctly formatted and accessible. Avoid using string indices where numerical indices are required.\n\n### Errors with function calls\n- **'Position' object is not callable:** Verify that the 'Position' object is being used correctly. Ensure that any callable functions or methods are used appropriately and that the 'Position' object is not mistakenly treated as a function.\n\n### General Tips\n- **BuildingBox size issues:** When using a BuildingBox, ensure that its size is appropriate for the available space on the map. Consider using smaller BuildingBoxes or adjusting the size to fit the environment.\n- **String indices must be integers:** When working with data structures, ensure that indices are of the correct type. Avoid using strings where integers are expected."}
