{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) and a Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) used to transfer items to the Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0).\n\n### Coal Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) and a Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) used to transfer items to the Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full chests. Specifically, ensure the chest at (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) are emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces lacking ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply iron ore to the furnaces at (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) to prevent them from idling."}
