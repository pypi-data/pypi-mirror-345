{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a status of WORKING, currently extracting iron ore from the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5). \n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with an inventory containing 189 iron ore. This chest is currently full, which is preventing further extraction from the burner mining drill.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a status of WORKING, currently processing iron ore into iron plates. It has an inventory of 91 iron plates and is fueled with coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting from a full chest**: The burner mining drill cannot extract iron ore because the wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. To mitigate this, ensure that the chest is emptied regularly to allow for continuous extraction.\n- **Errors when refueling entities**: Ensure that the correct entity is being refueled. The agent has repeatedly refueled the burner mining drill, but it is important to check if the entity requires refueling or if it is already adequately fueled.\n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace**: The agent has successfully inserted iron ore into the stone furnace, but if the furnace is full or out of fuel, this action will fail. Always check the furnace's inventory before inserting items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: No new utility functions were defined in the latest steps.\n- **Variables Assigned**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Entity of type `BurnerMiningDrill`\n  - `wooden_chest`: Entity of type `Chest`\n  - `stone_furnace`: Entity of type `Furnace`\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary of type `Inventory` containing items {'wood': 4, 'coal': 3}"}
