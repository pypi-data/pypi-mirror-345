{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position to successfully transfer items. The pickup position should match the chest's position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Always check inventory for available fuel before attempting to refuel machines. Ensure you have enough coal or other fuel sources in your inventory to avoid refueling errors.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly positioned and aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. The drop position of the inserter should align with the furnace's position to ensure the transfer of materials."}
