{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-8.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n\n### Furnace and Inserter Setup\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) connected to the furnace\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) connected to a wooden chest at position (18.5, 0.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of:\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5) and other positions connecting various entities\n- PipeGroup at position (1.5, 17.5) and other positions connecting various entities\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (11.5, 6.5), (17.5, -0.5), (15.5, 2.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Entity Connection and Status\n- Ensure all components of the electricity generator (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are properly connected. Check for missing connections or misplaced components.\n\n### Errors with Entity Status\n- Check the status of entities like boilers and steam engines to ensure they are connected and operational. Address any \"NOT_CONNECTED\" statuses by verifying connections and placements.\n\n### Errors with Distance When Placing Entities\n- Move closer to the target position when placing entities to ensure they are within the allowable placement range.\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes and Underground Pipes\n- Ensure the target location for placing pipes and underground pipes is not obstructed by other entities or terrain features. Consider clearing obstructions or choosing alternate paths.\n\n### Errors When Placing Steam Engines\n- Verify that the steam engine's footprint does not overlap with water or other entities. Adjust the position to ensure a clear area for placement.\n\n### Errors When Establishing Power Networks\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed within the correct range and not obstructed by other entities. Consider moving closer to the intended placement area if necessary.\n\n### Errors When Supplying Ingredients to Furnaces\n- Verify that the correct entity type is being referenced when supplying ingredients. Ensure that the target entity exists and is accessible.\n\n### Errors with Data Type and Attribute Usage\n- Ensure that data types used in calculations or assignments are appropriate (e.g., converting to integers). Double-check attribute names and ensure they exist in the context being used.\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure the offshore pump is placed correctly on water. Adjust the position if necessary to ensure proper water intake.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source. Check electric pole connections and ensure they are within range to supply power.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory in Boilers\n- Ensure that the boiler's inventory is not full before attempting to insert more items. Manage inventory levels to prevent overfilling."}
