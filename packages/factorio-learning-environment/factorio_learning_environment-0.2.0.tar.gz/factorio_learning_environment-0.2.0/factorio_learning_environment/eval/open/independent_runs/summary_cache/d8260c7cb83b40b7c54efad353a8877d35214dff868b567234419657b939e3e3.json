Ensure that all necessary modules are imported at the beginning of the script.\n\n### Cannot connect belts directly to a StoneFurnace object\n- Use an inserter to input items into the StoneFurnace. Belts cannot be directly connected to furnaces.\n\n### Could not insert: Inventory is full\n- Before inserting items into an entity, check its inventory capacity to ensure there is enough space.\n\n### AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'fuel'\n- The agent is trying to access the `fuel` attribute of an integer. This suggests that the agent is trying to access the fuel of an entity that does not have a fuel attribute, or that the fuel attribute is not being accessed correctly.\n\n### Failed to connect transport belt to inserter\n- The agent is trying to connect a transport belt to an inserter, but the connection is not valid. Ensure that the transport belt and inserter are properly aligned and that there is a valid path between them.\n\n### Could not place transport-belt at (x, y), The target position is too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place the entity. The agent's placement range is limited.\n\n### Could not place transport-belt at (x, y), entity already exists at the target position\n- Ensure that the target tile is empty before attempting to place an entity. Remove any existing entities from the tile before placing a new one.\n\nNAMESPACE\n- No new utility functions were defined in this step.\n```"}
