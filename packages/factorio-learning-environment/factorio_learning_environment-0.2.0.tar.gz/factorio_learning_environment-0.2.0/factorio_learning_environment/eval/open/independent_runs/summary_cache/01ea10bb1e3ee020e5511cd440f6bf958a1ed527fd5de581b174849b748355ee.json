{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5), connected to the power network and working.\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0), fueled with coal and working.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), supplying water to the boiler.\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Lab and Power Network\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5), conducting Automation research and connected to the power network.\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the lab, ensuring power supply.\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for input materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Lab Identification\n- Ensure the 'Lab' entity is correctly defined and available in the context before attempting to access or manipulate it.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Verify that all necessary pipes are available in the inventory and correctly placed to connect the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Ensure no missing segments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Status\n- Regularly check the steam engine's status to ensure it is working. If not, verify the connections and fuel supply to the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Supply\n- Maintain a sufficient coal supply to refuel the boiler consistently. Plan mining activities to avoid fuel shortages.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended structure."}
