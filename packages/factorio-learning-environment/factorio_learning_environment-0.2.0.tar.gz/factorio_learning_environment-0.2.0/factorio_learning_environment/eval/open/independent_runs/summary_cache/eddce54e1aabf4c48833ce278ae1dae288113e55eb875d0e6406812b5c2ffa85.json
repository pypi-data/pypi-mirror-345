{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nA complex smelting line for producing iron plates consisting of:\n\nInput Section (North):\n- 4 wooden chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) containing coal for fuel\n- 4 burner inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving materials from chests to furnaces\n\nSmelting Section (Center):\n- 4 stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n\nOutput Section (South):\n- 3 wooden chests at positions (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5) for collecting processed iron plates\n- 5 burner inserters at positions:\n  - (0.5, 1.5) and (1.5, 1.5) handling output from first furnace\n  - (3.5, 1.5) handling output from second furnace\n  - (5.5, 1.5) handling output from third and fourth furnaces\n\nThe structure forms a complete production line with input storage, automated material handling, smelting, and output collection capabilities.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Pickup Errors\n- Before attempting to pick up an entity, verify that the entity exists at the specified position\n- Double check coordinates when trying to pick up entities, as shown by the error at position (2.5, 1.5)\n\n### System Operation Issues\n- Furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - ensure proper material flow from input chests to furnaces\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner inserters to maintain continuous operation"}
