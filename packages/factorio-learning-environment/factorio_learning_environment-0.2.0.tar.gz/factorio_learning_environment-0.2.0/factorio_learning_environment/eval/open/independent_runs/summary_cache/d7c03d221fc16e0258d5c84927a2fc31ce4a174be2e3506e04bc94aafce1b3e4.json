{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5), status: WORKING\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0), status: WORKING\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), status: WORKING\n- Pipe Group connecting various entities, including positions (-4.5, 16.5), (-5.5, 16.5), (-2.5, 22.5), etc.\n- Electricity Group with Small Electric Poles at positions (-7.5, 22.5), (-6.5, 22.5), and (-1.5, 20.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, connecting pipes requires having pipes in inventory.\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are within range and compatible.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Always check your inventory for necessary items before attempting actions such as placing or connecting entities. For example, placing a small electric pole requires having it in your inventory.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel and Ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients and fuel are available for entities to function properly. For instance, the stone furnace requires ingredients to smelt, and the boiler requires coal to operate.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Make sure that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the electric network. Check that electric poles are placed and connected correctly to supply power to the necessary entities."}
