{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), responsible for extracting iron ore. It is currently fueled with coal and has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), also used for storing extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), refueled with coal, used to transfer items between the wooden chests.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), refueled with coal, used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., wooden chest) contains the item you intend to extract. Verify the contents before attempting extraction to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, check the target position for existing entities to avoid placement conflicts. Consider adjusting the spacing or direction if the intended position is occupied.\n- When placing entities such as chests or inserters, ensure there is no collision with existing entities or terrain features like water. Adjust the reference position or direction as needed.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of chests and other storage entities to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
