Verify the positions of all belts in the intended path to ensure continuity.\n\n### Index Errors in Code\n- Check the indices used in your code to ensure they are within the valid range of the list or array you are accessing. This will prevent \"list index out of range\" errors.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. Verify that the source entities contain items that the inserters can pick up.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations."}
