{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) storing coal\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chest\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates\n- BeltGroup connecting various components for efficient material flow\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5) transferring copper plates to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) storing copper plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items\n\n### Transport and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Burner Inserters positioned at (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), and (x=11.5, y=0.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests\n- BeltGroup facilitating the movement of items between different production facilities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Non-existent or Empty Entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists and contains the required items before attempting extraction. For example, verify the presence of coal in the wooden chest at (40.5, -83.5) before extraction.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity has the necessary items available for the inserter to transfer. Regularly supply the furnaces with ore to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate incoming items. Regularly clear out chests to prevent inserters from stalling due to full inventories."}
