{"content": "The attempt to place the stone furnace at the position (-14, -14) failed because it exceeded the maximum placement distance from the player's current position (0, 0). The distance of approximately 19.80 is greater than the allowed maximum distance of 10.\n\n### Summary of Actions and Errors:\n1. **Movement Command**: The player successfully moved to the target coordinates (-14, -14).\n2. **Placement Attempt**: The player attempted to place a stone furnace at this location, but it failed due to being too far from the current position.\n\n### Tips to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Check Placement Distance**: Always verify the distance between the player's current position and the target position before attempting to place an entity. Use the maximum allowed distance as a guideline.\n2. **Use Movement Commands**: If the target position is beyond the maximum distance, issue a movement command to get closer before attempting to place the entity.\n3. **Utilize Nearest Buildable Function**: Consider using the `nearest_buildable` function to find a valid position for placing the entity that is within range.\n4. **Plan Entity Placement**: When planning to build multiple entities, ensure that their positions are within the allowable range from the player\u2019s current location to avoid similar issues.\n5. **Monitor Player Position**: Keep track of the player's position after each movement to ensure that subsequent actions are valid relative to the new coordinates.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can streamline the process of placing entities and reduce the likelihood of encountering distance-related errors in the future.", "summary_range": "[1-162]"}
