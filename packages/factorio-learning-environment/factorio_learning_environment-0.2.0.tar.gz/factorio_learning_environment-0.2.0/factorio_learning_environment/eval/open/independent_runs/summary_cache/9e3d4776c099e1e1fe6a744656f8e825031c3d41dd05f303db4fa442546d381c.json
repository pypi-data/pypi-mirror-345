{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 19.5) - Connected to water system (fluid_system 15053)\n- **Boiler** at (18.0, 22.5) - Now producing steam (165\u00b0C) but still missing water input\n- **Steam engine** at (22.5, 22.5) - Operational with steam input but power network still incomplete\n- **New offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Remains disconnected\n\n### Oil Processing Complex (Critical Update)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Now powered and extracting crude oil (299,790 units)\n- **Oil refinery** at (27.5, 40.5) - Powered but showing fluid ingredient shortage\n- **Crude oil pipe network** - Working pipe group (fluid_system 15052) from (19.5,37.5) to refinery area but connection incomplete\n\n### Chemical Production Setup\n- **Chemical plant** at (37.5, 22.5) - Powered but missing water/petroleum inputs\n- **Storage tank** at (32.5, 22.5) - Connected via pipe-to-ground but empty\n- **Wooden chest** at (40.5, 22.5) - Still unused output target\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical Fluid Connection Failures (Recurring)\n- **Refinery input blockage** - Clear all pipes between (19.5,37.5) and refinery input at (30.5,39.5)\n- **Connection point verification** - Physically inspect refinery's crude oil input point orientation\n- **Underground pipe routing** - Implement underground pipes for long-distance crude oil transfer\n\n### Power System Deficiencies\n- **Network segmentation** - Verify all power poles form continuous network (current voltage: 2,382,836)\n- **Generator utilization** - Steam engine at 22.5,22.5 producing but not fully integrated\n\n### System Validation Protocol\n- **Pre-connection diagnostics** - Implement physical connection point inspection routine\n- **Fluid flow testing** - Test pipe segments individually before system integration\n- **Entity status monitoring** - Check warnings/status flags before operations (refinery shows FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE)\n\n### Connection Best Practices\n- **Directional alignment** - Verify all connection points face correct directions\n- **Clearance verification** - Ensure 1-tile clearance around critical connection points\n- **Subsystem isolation** - Test pumpjack output separately before refinery connection\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `connect_fluid_system()` - Requires pre-validation for physical path clearance\n- `verify_power_connection()` - Needs network continuity check implementation\n\n### Variables\n- `steam_engine_pos` - Now operational but network integration incomplete\n- `refinery_pos` - Powered but input connection remains critical failure point\n- `chemical_plant_pos` - Input configuration needs verification\n- `output_chest_pos` - Still unused in production chain"}
