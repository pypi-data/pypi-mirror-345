{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=5.5, y=27.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) and another at position (x=0.5, y=30.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions to facilitate fluid movement\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\n- Inserter at position (x=16.5, y=0.5) and another at position (x=17.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=18.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Fluid Transport System\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 27167 at position (x=-14.5, y=14.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 27170 at position (x=-14.5, y=17.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups facilitating fluid transport across the map\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 34579, connecting various small electric poles across the map\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that the pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Check for any missing or misplaced pipes that could disrupt the connection.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network. Ensure that all necessary connections are made and that there are no gaps in the power lines.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Make sure that the inserters are connected to a power source. Check the electricity network for any disconnections or missing power poles.\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Confirm that the boiler is connected to a working fluid supply. Check the pipe connections and ensure that the fluid system is operational and delivering the necessary input liquid.\n\n### Repeated Picking Up of Pipes\n- Avoid repeatedly picking up and placing the same pipes unless necessary. This can lead to inefficiencies and potential errors in the fluid transport system."}
