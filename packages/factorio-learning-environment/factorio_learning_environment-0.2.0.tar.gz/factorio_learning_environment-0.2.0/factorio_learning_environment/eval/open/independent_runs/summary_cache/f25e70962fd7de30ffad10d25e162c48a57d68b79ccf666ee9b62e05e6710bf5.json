{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these components at positions including (-47.5, -122.5), (-46.5, -121.5), (-45.5, -120.5), (-44.5, -119.5), (-43.5, -118.5), and (-42.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Inserter and Storage System at Position (6.5, -60.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Lab at Position (Not Specified)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- Multiple PipeGroups are present across various positions, such as (-50.5, -122.5), (-44.5, -123.5), (-48.5, -120.5), and others, indicating a complex fluid transport network.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles connecting various structures, ensuring power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure the target position for placing a pipe is clear of any existing entities before attempting to place a new pipe. Remove any obstructing entities first.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is correctly connected to both a water source and a power network. Ensure that the boiler is receiving water and fuel to generate steam.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check that the inserter is properly connected to the power network. Ensure that the small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to provide power to the inserter.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type to avoid placement errors."}
