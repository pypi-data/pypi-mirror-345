{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone mine at position(-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-45.5, y=1.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=1.5) that moves stone from the chest to the furnace at position(-45.0, 3.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-45.0, y=3.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=4.5) that moves stone bricks from the furnace to the chest at position(-44.5, 5.5)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-44.5, y=5.5)\n\n#### Stone brick factory at position(-43.5, 7.5)\nConsists of \n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=-43.5, y=7.5)\n- Small electric pole (position x=-43.5, y=9.5)\n\n#### Electricity generator at position(-39.5, 7.0)\nConsists of \n- Boiler (position x=-39.5, y=7.0)\n- Steam engine (position x=-35.5, y=7.5)\n- Offshore pump (position x=-21.5, y=-2.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler (positions x=-23.5 y=-2.5 to x=-41.5 y=6.5)\n- Small electric pole (position x=-40.5, y=8.5), (position x=-38.5, y=9.5), and (position x=-35.5, y=9.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity.\n- Make sure you are within the maximum allowed distance when placing an entity.\n\n#### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Verify that an entity of the expected type exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them in your code.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure that the chest contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n\n#### Common error patterns\n- The agent made multiple errors related to incorrect usage of API functions (e.g., trying to place an entity at an occupied position, attempting to retrieve non-existent entities, and using undefined variables). To avoid these errors, ensure that you understand the correct usage of the API functions and verify the preconditions before calling them.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that entities are properly connected (e.g., pipes are connected to the correct entities, and electric poles are within range).\n\n#### Errors related to power supply\n- The assembling machine and steam engine are not receiving power or are not connected to the power network. Ensure that the power poles are correctly connected and that the entities are within the power network.\n\n#### Errors related to missing resources\n- The assembling machine is not producing output due to missing resources (e.g., stone-brick). Ensure that the required resources are available in the input inventory.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
