{"content": "Ah, now I understand the real error! The problem isn't with coal - it's with entity placement. The error message tells us we can't place the burner inserter because there's already a stone furnace at that position. We need to adjust the spacing or position.\n\nLet's modify the code to use a larger spacing and different reference position:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Get coal first\nmove_to(nearest(Resource.Coal))\nprint(\"Moving to nearest coal patch\")\nharvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Coal), quantity=20)\nprint(\"Harvested coal\")\n\n# Fuel the mining drill\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\ndrill = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\nif drill:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(f\"Added fuel to mining drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n# Craft a stone furnace\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nprint(\"Crafted stone furnace\")\n\n# Place the furnace\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0),\n    direction=Direction.UP\n)\n\nif furnace:\n    print(f\"Placed new furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    # Add fuel to the furnace\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n    # Add input inserter with increased spacing\n    input_inserter = place_entity_next_to(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n        reference_position=Position(x=furnace.position.x - 2, y=furnace.position.y),  # Move reference point 2 units left\n        direction=Direction.LEFT,\n        spacing=2  # Increase spacing to 2\n    )\n    \n    if input_inserter:\n        print(f\"Added input inserter at {input_inserter.position}\")\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, input_inserter, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added fuel to input inserter\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Current entities: {entities}\")\n```\n\nKey changes made:\n1. Increased the spacing parameter to 2 in place_entity_next_to\n2. Modified the reference position to be 2 units left of the furnace\n3. This should give enough clearance to place the inserter without overlapping with the furnace\n\nThe error was occurring because the default spacing of 1 wasn't enough to prevent overlap between the furnace and the inserter. By increasing the spacing and adjusting the reference position, we should be able to place the inserter successfully.", "summary_range": "[1-880]"}
