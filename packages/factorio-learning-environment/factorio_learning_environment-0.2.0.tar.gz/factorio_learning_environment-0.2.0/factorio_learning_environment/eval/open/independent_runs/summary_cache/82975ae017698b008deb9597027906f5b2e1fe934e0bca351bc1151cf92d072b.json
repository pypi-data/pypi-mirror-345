Avoid treating non-callable objects like 'Chest' as functions.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Verify that all variable names and class names are correctly defined and imported. Use the correct case and spelling, such as 'burner_inserter' instead of 'BurnerInserter'.\n\n### Inserter Drop Position Mismatch\n- Adjust inserter positions to ensure that the drop position aligns with the intended target. Double-check inserter configurations to avoid mismatches.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. Check the supply chain to confirm that items are available for inserters to pick up.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Monitor chest inventories to prevent them from becoming full, which can block production lines. Regularly empty chests to maintain workflow efficiency."}
