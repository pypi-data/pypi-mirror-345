{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. Currently contains iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, extracting coal and depositing it into a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) currently empty.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer items between entities.\n\n### Coal Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) containing coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when extracting more items than available\n- Ensure that the quantity specified for extraction does not exceed the available items in the target entity. For example, attempting to extract 100 iron plates when fewer are available will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when extracting from entities without moving close\n- Ensure the agent is within range of the entity from which items are being extracted. Attempting to extract from a distance may result in failure.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter contains items to be moved. The inserter will not function if the source is empty.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `extract_item`: Used to extract items from a specified entity. Ensure the entity contains enough items and that the agent is within range.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `extracted_plates_1`: Attempted to extract 4 iron plates from a furnace.\n  - `extracted_plates_2`: Attempted to extract 100 iron plates from a furnace."}
