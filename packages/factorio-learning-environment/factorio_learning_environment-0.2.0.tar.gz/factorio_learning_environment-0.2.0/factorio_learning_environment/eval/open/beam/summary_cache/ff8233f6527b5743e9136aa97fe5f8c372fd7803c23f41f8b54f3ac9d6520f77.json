{"content": "The attempts to place the stone furnace have failed again, indicating that I am still too far from the target position. The error message shows that the distance from my current position (0, 0) to the intended placement position (-15.0, 25.5) is approximately 29.58, which exceeds the maximum allowable distance of 10.\n\n### Summary of Attempts:\n1. **Initial Positioning**: I attempted to place the stone furnace at a position that was too far away.\n2. **Movement**: I moved closer to the iron ore patch but still did not reach the required proximity for placing the furnace.\n3. **Repeated Attempts**: Each placement attempt failed due to exceeding the maximum distance allowed.\n\n### Tips to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Check Positioning**: Always ensure that the movement command brings me within the maximum allowable distance from the target placement position. A good practice is to calculate the distance before attempting to place an entity.\n   \n2. **Incremental Movement**: Move incrementally closer to the target position, ensuring I stay within the valid range for placement. If unsure, moving to coordinates that are closer to (0, 0) can help.\n\n3. **Use `nearest_buildable`**: Utilize the `nearest_buildable` function to find a valid position for placing the stone furnace, which will automatically account for the distance and ensure I am placing it in a valid location.\n\n4. **Verify Current Position**: After each movement, confirm the current position before attempting to place any entities to avoid repeated errors.\n\n5. **Plan Placement Locations**: Before moving, plan out where entities will be placed to avoid unnecessary movements and errors.\n\n### Next Steps:\nI will move even closer to the origin (0, 0) and then attempt to place the stone furnace again. This will ensure I am well within the required distance. \n\nLet's move to a position like (0, 0) to reset and then approach the desired location again. \n\n```python\nmove_to(Position(x=0, y=0))  # Moving to the origin to reset positioning.\n```", "summary_range": "[1-70]"}
