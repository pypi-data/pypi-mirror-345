{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-14, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Storage chest at (23.5, -16.5)\nMining coal with current storage of 318 coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Storage chest at (-14.5, 21.5)\nMining iron ore with current storage of 271 iron ore\n\n### Iron Smelting Station at (-10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\nCurrently idle due to lack of ingredients\n\n### Copper Processing Complex at (22, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) with output chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Input inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving ore from chest (22.5, 21.5) to furnace\n- Output inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving plates from furnace to storage chest (24.5, 17.5)\n- Multiple storage chests:\n  - Copper ore storage at (22.5, 21.5) containing 385 ore\n  - Copper plate storage at (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing new inserters, check if the position is already occupied by another entity\n- When placing entities next to existing structures, ensure proper spacing and direction parameters to avoid conflicts with existing entities\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning - ensure proper connection between input inserters and material supply\n- Monitor fuel levels in furnaces - some are showing \"furnace fuel source is full\" warning"}
