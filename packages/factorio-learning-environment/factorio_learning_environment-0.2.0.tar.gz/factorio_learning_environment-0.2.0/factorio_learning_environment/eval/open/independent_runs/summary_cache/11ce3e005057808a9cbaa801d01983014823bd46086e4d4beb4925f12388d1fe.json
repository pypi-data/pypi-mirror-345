Verify the position and presence of the entity, such as a Wooden Chest, before connecting.\n\n### Errors due to output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity to accept output from mining drills or other production entities. Check for any items blocking the output and clear them to allow smooth operation.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Verify the inventory of the source entity and ensure it is not empty."}
