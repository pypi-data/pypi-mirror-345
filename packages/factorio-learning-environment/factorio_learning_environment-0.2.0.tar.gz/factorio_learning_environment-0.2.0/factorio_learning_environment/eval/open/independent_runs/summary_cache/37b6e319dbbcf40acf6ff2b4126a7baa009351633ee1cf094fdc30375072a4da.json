{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), which extracts iron ore and is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), which transfers iron ore from the chest to:\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), which transfers iron ore from the chest to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), which transfers iron plates from the furnace to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) for storage.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### UnboundLocalError: Cannot Access Local Variable 'x'\n- Ensure that all variables are properly initialized before being accessed in the code. This error occurs when a variable is used before it has been assigned a value.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting But Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing Into a Tile Which Is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to source items. Check that the source inventory is not empty and that the inserter is correctly aligned with the source entity."}
