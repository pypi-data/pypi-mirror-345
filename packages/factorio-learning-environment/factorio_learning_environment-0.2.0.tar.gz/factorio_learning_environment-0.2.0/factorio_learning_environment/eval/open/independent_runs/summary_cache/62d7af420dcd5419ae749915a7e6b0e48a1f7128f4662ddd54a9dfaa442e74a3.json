{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and other components have failed, resulting in no structures being established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location is unoccupied and valid for placing the desired entity. Verify that there is enough space and that the terrain is suitable for the entity type.\n\n### Errors with BuildingBox size and placement\n- Adjust the size of the BuildingBox or use multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to find a viable location for placing entities like the Burner Mining Drill. Ensure that the selected area is clear and suitable for the entity size.\n\n### Errors with non-productive setups\n- Review the setup to ensure that all components are correctly connected and configured. Verify that resources are being transported and processed as intended to produce the desired outputs, such as iron plates.\n\n### Errors with missing entities\n- Before attempting to interact with an entity, confirm that it exists at the specified location. Use functions to check for the presence of entities like Stone Furnaces before performing actions on them.\n\n### Errors with API usage\n- Ensure that the API functions are used correctly, with the appropriate parameters and context. Refer to the documentation for correct usage patterns and examples."}
