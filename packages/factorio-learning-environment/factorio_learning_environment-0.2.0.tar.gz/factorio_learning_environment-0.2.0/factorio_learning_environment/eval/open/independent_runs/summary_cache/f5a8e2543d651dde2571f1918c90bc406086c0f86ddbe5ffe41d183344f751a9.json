Use the map view to verify the availability of the tile.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors Due to Misplaced Pipes\n- Double-check the intended position before placing pipes to avoid misplacement and ensure they connect correctly to the intended fluid system."}
