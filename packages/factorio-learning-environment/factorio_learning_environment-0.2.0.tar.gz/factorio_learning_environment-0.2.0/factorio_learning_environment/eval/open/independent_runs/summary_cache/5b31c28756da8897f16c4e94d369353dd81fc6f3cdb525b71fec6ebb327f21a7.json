This includes checking for existing objects in the way.\n\n### Errors when using electric poles but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to connect power before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient inventory\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to place or connect entities. Ensure you have the required items available.\n\n### Errors related to power connection\n- Verify that electric poles are properly connected to the electric network. If they are not plugged in, check the placement and surrounding entities.\n\n### Attribute errors\n- Ensure that you are accessing the correct attributes of entities. For example, avoid accessing attributes that do not exist for certain entity types."}
