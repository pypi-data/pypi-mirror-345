{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace  \nUse-case: Processes iron ore into iron plates with an integrated collection point for direct resource storage and management.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resource availability\n- Verify that the required resource is present in your inventory before attempting to insert into an entity. Confirm that the expected resource (e.g., iron ore or coal) is available to avoid insertion failures.\n  \n### Errors related to timing in processing cycles\n- Allow sufficient time for the processing cycle to complete so that outputs become available, avoiding premature extraction or insertion attempts.\n\n### Repeated mistakes with resource assertions\n- Confirm resource levels beforehand to prevent assertion failures. Check inventories and resource patches to guarantee that the required amounts are accessible prior to smelting operations."}
