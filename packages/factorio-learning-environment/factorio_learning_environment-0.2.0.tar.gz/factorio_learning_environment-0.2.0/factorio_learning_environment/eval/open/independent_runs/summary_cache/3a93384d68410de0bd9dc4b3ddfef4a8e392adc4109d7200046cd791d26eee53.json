{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Storage chest at (23.5, -16.5) containing 335 coal\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Storage chest at (-14.5, 21.5) containing 293 iron ore\n\n### Copper Mining and Processing at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Storage chest at (20.5, 21.5) containing 339 copper ore\n- Secondary storage chest at (22.5, 21.5) containing 379 copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n- Burner inserter at (23.5, 21.5) moving items from input chest to furnace\n\n### Inactive Smelting Area at (-10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Placement and Configuration Issues\n- When placing inserters, ensure the pickup and drop positions align with the source and destination entities\n- Verify that inserters have a valid destination entity before placing them\n- The inserter at (23.5, 21.5) is showing a warning about blocked output - ensure there is a proper destination entity to accept items\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Multiple furnaces are showing \"no ingredients\" status - verify the input inserter configuration is correct\n- One furnace is showing \"fuel source is full\" warning - this is not necessarily an error but indicates potential inefficiency in fuel distribution\n\n### General Structure Planning\n- When building processing chains, ensure all components (input storage, inserters, processing buildings, output storage) are properly aligned and connected\n- Test each component of the production chain individually before connecting them together to identify issues early"}
