{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5), boiler (position -34.5, 30.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0) that currently has 6 iron ore available for smelting.\n\n### Lab at position(-15.5, 18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position -15.5, 18.5) which is currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe groups\n- PipeGroup (position -24.5, 21.5) with full output status.\n- PipeGroup (position -4.5, 21.5) with empty status.\n- PipeGroup (position -4.5, 23.5) with empty status.\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of multiple small electric poles, including:\n- Small electric pole (position -30.5, 27.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -28.5, 27.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -27.5, 27.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -27.5, 28.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items from inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. In this case, there was an attempt to insert iron ore into a furnace without having any iron ore in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. \n\n### Errors related to power and connections\n- Check that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the electricity network to avoid issues like \"no power\" or \"not connected to power network\"."}
