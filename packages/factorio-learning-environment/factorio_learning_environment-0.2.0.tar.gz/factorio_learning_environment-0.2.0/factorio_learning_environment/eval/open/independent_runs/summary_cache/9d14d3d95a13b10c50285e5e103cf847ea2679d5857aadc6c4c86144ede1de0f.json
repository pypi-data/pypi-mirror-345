{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\n- **Iron Ore Storage**: Wooden chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Transfer System**: Wooden chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) receiving iron ore from the storage chest.\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\n- **Coal Storage**: Wooden chest at position (x=54.5, y=-78.5) containing coal.\n- **Transfer System**: Wooden chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) receiving coal from the storage chest.\n\n### Stone Furnace for Iron Plate Production\n- **Stone Furnace**: Located at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0), used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently has a full inventory of iron plates and iron ore.\n\n### Coal Drill\n- **Coal Drill**: Positioned at (x=52.0, y=-82.0), used for extracting coal. Recently refueled with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into full inventories\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. This prevents failed insertions due to full inventories, as seen with the stone furnace at position (x=-14, y=-49).\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Inventory of the iron ore chest.\n- `coal_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Inventory of the coal chest.\n- `target_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Inventory of the target chest receiving resources.\n- `stone_furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Inventory of the stone furnace.\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Agent's current inventory containing various resources."}
