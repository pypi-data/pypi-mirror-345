{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing iron ore\n- Additional Wooden Chest at position (5.5, -60.5) for iron plate storage\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of multiple storage chests for iron plates:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-21.5, -54.5), (-20.5, -54.5), (-19.5, -54.5), (-18.5, -54.5), (-17.5, -54.5), (-16.5, -54.5), and (-15.5, -54.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) storing iron plates\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), and (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore and Iron Plate Processing\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden Chests for storing processed materials\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory in Storage Chests\n- Ensure that storage chests have enough space before attempting to insert items. Consider crafting additional storage chests if existing ones are full.\n\n### Errors When Refueling Mining Drills\n- Always check that you have the necessary fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel mining drills.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `place_entity(Prototype, position)`: Used to place entities on the map. Ensure the required entity is available in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `new_storage_chest`: Represents a newly placed storage chest on the map.\n  - `storage_position`: Position where new storage chests are placed.\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary representing the current inventory status, including items like 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
