{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with direction DOWN. It is currently out of fuel and has a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5). It is extracting iron ore with a resource count of 10,000.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -48.0) with direction UP. It is fueled with coal and has produced 29 iron plates. The furnace is directly aligned with the mining drill's drop position.\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with direction UP. It is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt. It holds 2 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a burner mining drill without having one in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources for crafting\n- Before crafting, verify that you have enough resources in your inventory. Attempting to craft a burner mining drill without sufficient resources will fail.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 tiles. For instance, placing a stone furnace from a distance of 50.62 tiles will not succeed.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles or unsuitable terrain\n- Check that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place an entity. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid collisions or unsuitable terrain. For example, placing a burner inserter next to a mining drill may fail if the position is occupied or unsuitable."}
