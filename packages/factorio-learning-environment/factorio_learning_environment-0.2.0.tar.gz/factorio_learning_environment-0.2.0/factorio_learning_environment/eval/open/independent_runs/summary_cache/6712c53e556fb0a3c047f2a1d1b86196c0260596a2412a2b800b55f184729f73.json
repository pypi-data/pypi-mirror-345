{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler 1 at position (-14.5, 20.0)\n- Boiler 2 at position (-11.5, 20.0)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump to the boilers\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal fuel\n- Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) with coal fuel\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) transferring items between furnaces and a chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnaces to the chest\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) storing iron plates\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) storing iron plates\n- Transport Belts connecting various chests and inserters\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), and (-14.5, -43.5) facilitating item movement\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Pipe Groups connecting various entities, including a fluid system at position (-16.5, 20.5) with water\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boilers, and steam engines. Verify that the required items are in the inventory before attempting connections.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. Check that the source entities are producing items and that there is no blockage in the transport belts or chests.\n\n### Inventory Full Errors\n- Regularly check and manage inventory space to ensure there is room for new items. Consider using additional storage chests if necessary.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Verify that the target location is suitable for placing entities, ensuring no existing objects or terrain features (like water) are in the way. Adjust positions as needed.\n\n### Errors when Storing Items in Full Chests\n- Monitor chest inventories to prevent them from becoming full. Use additional chests or manage the output flow to avoid blockages.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as boilers and burner inserters, are regularly supplied with fuel to maintain operation."}
