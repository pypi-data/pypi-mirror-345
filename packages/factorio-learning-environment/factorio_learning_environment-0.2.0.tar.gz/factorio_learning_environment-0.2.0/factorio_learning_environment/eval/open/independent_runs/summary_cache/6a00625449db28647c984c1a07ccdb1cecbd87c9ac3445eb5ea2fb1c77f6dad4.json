{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) and another at position (54.5, -84.5). The chest at (52.5, -84.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) and another at position (-24.5, -67.5). The drill is out of fuel.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) and a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden chests at positions (-12.5, -54.5) and (-14.5, -54.5) for storage.\n- The burner mining drill is out of fuel.\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden chests at positions (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), and (0.5, -2.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility at Position (5.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, -2.5), (5.5, -3.5), and (5.5, 0.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (-16.5, -64.5) and (-20.5, -63.5) for iron plate storage.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using pickup_entity with incorrect object type\n- Ensure that the object being called is a valid callable entity. The error indicates that a 'Chest' object was attempted to be called as a function, which is not possible. Verify the entity type before calling.\n\n### Errors due to full storage chests\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full inventories.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in mining drills\n- Ensure that all mining drills have a sufficient supply of fuel to maintain continuous operation. Regularly refuel drills to prevent downtime.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly supply furnaces with raw materials to maintain production efficiency."}
