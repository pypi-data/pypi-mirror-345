{"content": "The error indicates that the `Inventory` object does not have a `values()` method. Instead, we should directly iterate over the inventory items using the appropriate method provided by the environment.\n\nLet's correct this by iterating over the inventory using the correct method:\n\n```python\n# Ensure that the furnace is completely emptied\n\nmove_to(furnace_position)\n\n# Extract all contents using the correct method to iterate over inventory\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nfor item_type in furnace_inventory:\n    quantity = furnace_inventory.get(item_type, 0)\n    if quantity > 0:\n        extract_item(item_type, furnace_entity.position, quantity=quantity)\n\n# After extraction, check inventory to ensure it is empty\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(\"Furnace inventory after complete extraction: \", furnace_inventory)\n\n# Validate complete emptiness by checking each item type\nassert all(furnace_inventory.get(item_type, 0) == 0 for item_type in furnace_inventory), \"Furnace should be entirely empty now.\"\n\n# Attempt to insert coal again into the cleared furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace_entity, quantity=1)\n\n# Allow for processing to occur\nsleep(10)\n\n# Print furnace inventory to verify coal insertion\nfurnace_post_action_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(\"Furnace status after coal insertion attempt: \", furnace_post_action_inventory)\n\n# Finally, revalidate coal addition\nassert furnace_post_action_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) > 0, \"Coal was not added to the furnace as expected.\"\n\n# Print final state and entities for conclusive validation\nprint(f\"Final Inventory after Coal Insertion Task: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities available post-diagnostic actions: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly iterate over the inventory and check each item type for its quantity, ensuring the furnace is empty before attempting to insert coal.", "summary_range": "[1-82]"}
