{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Crude Oil Extraction Setup at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a Pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5), Crude Oil Storage Tank at position(22.5, 40.5), and PipeGroup connecting the pumpjack to the crude oil storage tank at various positions, although the pipe connection is currently not established due to errors.\n\n#### Electricity Generator at position(-3.5, 2.5)\nConsists of \n- Offshore Pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-7.5, 0.0)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine at various positions\n- Steam Engine at position(-3.5, 2.5)\n- ElectricityGroup (power poles) connecting the steam engine to the pumpjack and oil refinery at various positions\n\n#### Oil Refinery Setup at position(27.5, 40.5)\nConsists of \n- Oil Refinery at position(27.5, 40.5)\n- Crude Oil Storage Tank at position(22.5, 40.5)\n- Another Crude Oil Storage Tank at position(32.5, 40.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the crude oil storage tank to the oil refinery and another crude oil storage tank at various positions\n- ElectricityGroup (power poles) connecting the steam engine to the oil refinery at various positions\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities without fluid\n- Ensure the source entity has fluid in it before connecting it to another entity that requires fluid.\n\n#### Errors when inspecting inventory of an entity\n- Check if the entity has an inventory before attempting to inspect it.\n\n#### Errors when getting an entity at a specific position\n- Verify that an entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n#### Errors when powering entities\n- Ensure that the power network is properly connected and that the entity is receiving power.\n\n#### Errors when using undefined variables or incorrect prototype names\n- Define variables before using them in the code and ensure that the correct prototype names are used (e.g., Prototype.UndergroundPipe instead of Prototype.PipeToGround).\n\n#### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Make sure none of the source or target connection points are blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- crude_oil_storage_tank: StorageTank entity at position(22.5, 40.5) of type StorageTank. \nThe variable was used to inspect the inventory but resulted in an error because the entity does not have an inventory in the classical sense, it has a fluid box.\n- pumpjack: PumpJack entity at position(17.5, 40.5) of type PumpJack.\n- oil_refinery: OilRefinery entity at position(27.5, 40.5) of type OilRefinery."}
