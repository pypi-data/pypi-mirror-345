{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the provided execution logs.\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at (-41, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for coal storage\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n\n### Furnace Processing Setup at (-46, -81)\nConsists of:\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) moving right\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) for furnace input\n- Stone furnace at (46.0, -81.0)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Spacing Issues\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities - furnaces need adequate space around them for inserters\n- Check if target placement position is clear of other entities before placing\n- When placing multiple connected entities, plan the layout considering the size of each entity\n\n### Entity Rotation Issues\n- Some entities like stone furnaces cannot be rotated after placement\n- Pre-rotate entities to desired direction before placement\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- Cannot connect belts directly to furnaces - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- Ensure proper alignment between belt-inserter-furnace chains for items to flow correctly\n\n### Entity Positioning\n- Consider the full dimensions of entities when placing them (e.g., furnaces are 2x2)\n- Leave adequate space between entities for inserters to function properly\n- Align entities properly on the grid to ensure inserters can reach their pickup/drop positions\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `rotate_entity()`: Rotates an entity to face a specific direction\n- `place_entity()`: Places an entity at specified coordinates\n- `connect_entities()`: Creates connections between compatible entities\n- `remove_entity()`: Removes an entity from the map\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: Entity reference (Prototype.StoneFurnace)\n- `belt`: Entity reference (Prototype.TransportBelt)\n- `furnace_inserter`: Entity reference (Prototype.BurnerInserter)\n\nAll functions show evidence of being used with mixed success, with main failure modes being:\n- Invalid entity placement positions\n- Incorrect entity rotation attempts\n- Invalid entity connections\n- Spacing/collision issues between entities"}
