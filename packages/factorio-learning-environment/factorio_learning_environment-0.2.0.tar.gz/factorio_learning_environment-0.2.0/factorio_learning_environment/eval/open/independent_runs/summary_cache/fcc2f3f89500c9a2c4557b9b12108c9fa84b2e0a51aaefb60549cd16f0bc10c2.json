The error regarding crafting iron-plate indicates that you need either a crafting machine or a furnace with the appropriate ingredients.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. The errors related to inserting coal and iron-stick indicate that the agent did not have these items available in their inventory at the time of the action.\n- Verify that there is a nearby entity that can accept the item you are trying to insert.
