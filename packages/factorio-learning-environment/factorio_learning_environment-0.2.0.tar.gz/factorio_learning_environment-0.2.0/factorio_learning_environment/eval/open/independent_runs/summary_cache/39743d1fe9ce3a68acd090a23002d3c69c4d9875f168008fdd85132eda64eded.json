{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, with output directed to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two Stone Furnaces at positions (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Both furnaces are currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, with output directed to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the chest and further to other chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, with output directed to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Transport Belts and Burner Inserters facilitating the movement of materials between entities.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Processing Units\n- Wooden Chests at various positions for storage of materials such as iron plates, coal, and ores.\n- Burner Inserters at various positions for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Several Belt Groups connecting different parts of the facilities, facilitating the transport of materials between various entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using entities that lack attributes\n- Ensure that you are using the correct attributes for the entities. For example, a 'Chest' object does not have an 'outputs' attribute. Verify the entity type and its available attributes before attempting to use them.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect entities\n- When connecting entities, ensure that both entities are compatible and have the necessary attributes for connection. Double-check the entity types and their connection capabilities before executing the connection command."}
