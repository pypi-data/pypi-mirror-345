{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 19.5) - Still disconnected from water system\n- **Boiler** at (18.0, 22.5) - Now fueled with coal but still missing water input\n- **Steam engine** at (22.5, 22.5) - Operational but not connected to power network\n- **Secondary offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Remains unused\n\n### Oil Production Complex (Critical Update)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Now powered but showing connection failures\n- **Oil refinery** at (27.5, 40.5) - Powered but crude oil input connection still failing\n- **Crude oil pipe network** - Multiple failed connection attempts between (17.5,40.5) and (20.5,40.5)\n\n### Chemical Production Area\n- **Chemical plant** at (37.5, 22.5) - Now powered but missing water/petroleum inputs\n- **Storage tank** at (32.5, 22.5) - Empty and not integrated into system\n- **Output chest** at (40.5, 22.5) - Still unused in production chain\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Fluid Connection Failures (Critical)\n- **Pumpjack output blockage** - Verify connection point at (18.5,38.5) is clear and facing correct direction\n- **Underground pipe misalignment** - Ensure underground pipe entry/exit points are properly spaced (minimum 4 tiles apart)\n- **Priming requirement** - Pumpjacks require initial crude oil to establish flow (cannot connect empty source)\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- **Generator isolation** - Steam engine at 22.5,22.5 producing but not connected to any consumers\n- **Pole placement verification** - Check all small-electric-poles form continuous network (current voltage: 13,149)\n\n### System Validation Protocol\n- **Pre-connection diagnostics** - Implement physical connection point inspection routine\n- **Directional verification** - Confirm all fluid connection points face correct directions (pumpjack output faces UP)\n- **Entity status monitoring** - Check warnings/status flags before operations (multiple entities show NO_POWER)\n\n### Connection Best Practices\n- **Single-segment testing** - Test pumpjack output with single pipe before attempting long connections\n- **Clearance verification** - Ensure 1-tile clearance around all connection points\n- **Power prioritization** - Complete power network before attempting fluid connections\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `connect_fluid_system()` - Requires pre-validation for physical path clearance\n- `verify_power_connection()` - Needs network continuity check implementation\n\n### Variables\n- `steam_engine_pos` - Operational but network integration incomplete\n- `refinery_pos` - Powered but input connection remains critical failure point\n- `chemical_plant_pos` - Input configuration needs verification\n- `output_chest_pos` - Still unused in production chain"}
