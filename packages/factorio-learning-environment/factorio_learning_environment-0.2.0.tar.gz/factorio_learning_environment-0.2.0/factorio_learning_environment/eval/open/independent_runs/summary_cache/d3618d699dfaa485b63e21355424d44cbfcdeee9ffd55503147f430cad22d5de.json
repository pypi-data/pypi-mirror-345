{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (14.5, 22.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (14.5, 22.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the steam engine, with various pipe segments at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storage\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at an unspecified position with input for automation science packs, currently not conducting research.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before placing an entity. Check for existing objects or unplaceable terrain such as water.\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Pipes\n- Verify that there is no existing entity at the target position before placing a pipe. Remove any obstructing entities before attempting to reconnect.\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place pipes, as the distance should not exceed the maximum allowable distance for placement.\n\n### Errors When Accessing Entities\n- Confirm the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to access it. Ensure the entity type matches the expected type.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- Ensure that operands in calculations are of compatible types. Avoid using incompatible types such as 'ModelPrivateAttr' with integers in arithmetic operations."}
