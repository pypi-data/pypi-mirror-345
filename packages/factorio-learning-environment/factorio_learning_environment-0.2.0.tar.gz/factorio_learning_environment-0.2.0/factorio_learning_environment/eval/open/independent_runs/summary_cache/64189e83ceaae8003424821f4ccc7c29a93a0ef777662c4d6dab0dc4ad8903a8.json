{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-45.5, -124.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-45.5, -124.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -123.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-44.5, -119.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of the following pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-1.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-4.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Networks\nConsists of the following electricity groups:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles starting at Position (4.5, -62.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles starting at Position (0.5, 22.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established. The offshore pump and boiler are not receiving or transferring fluids correctly. Verify that the connections between these entities are complete and unobstructed.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Water Input\n- The boiler is not receiving water. Check the connection from the offshore pump to the boiler to ensure water is being transferred. Make sure the pipes are connected correctly and there are no gaps.\n\n### Errors with Power Connections\n- The steam engine is not connected to the power network. Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the electricity network to distribute power effectively.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- The inserter is not receiving electricity. Verify that the inserter is connected to a powered electric pole and that the electricity network is active.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Ingredients\n- Furnaces are showing warnings for no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that the necessary raw materials are supplied to the furnaces for production."}
