Check if the source is empty or not connected properly.\n\n### AttributeError with BeltGroup Object\n- When inspecting belt networks, ensure that you access attributes that exist on the BeltGroup object. The 'direction' attribute does not exist on BeltGroup; instead, inspect individual belts within the group for direction information.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the input sources and ensure they are connected and supplying the required materials."}
