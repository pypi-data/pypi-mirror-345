{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates. The furnace is currently full, with 100 iron plates in its output.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates. The furnace is currently full, with 100 iron plates in its output.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring items from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring items between chests.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5), transferring items from the furnace to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), (-7.5, -47.5), (-6.5, -47.5), and (-6.5, -48.5) for storage of iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not full. Regularly transfer items from destination chests to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Output Being Full\n- Regularly clear the output of furnaces to prevent production halts. Consider using additional storage or inserters to automate this process.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source for inserters has available items. Monitor resource levels in chests and furnaces to maintain a steady flow of materials.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert items into machines or furnaces, verify that the required items are available in your inventory."}
