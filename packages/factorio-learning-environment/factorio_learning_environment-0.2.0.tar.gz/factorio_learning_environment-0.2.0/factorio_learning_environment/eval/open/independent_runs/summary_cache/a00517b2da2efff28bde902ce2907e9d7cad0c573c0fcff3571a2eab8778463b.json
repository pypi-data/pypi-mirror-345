{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=53.5, y=-80.5) receiving coal from the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) transferring coal from the chest to another destination.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-78.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-76.5) awaiting source items for further transfer.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) awaiting source items for transfer.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-48.5) awaiting source items for transfer.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) awaiting source items for transfer.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) empty, awaiting items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- The chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) is full. Ensure to regularly empty the chest to prevent mining operations from halting due to lack of storage space.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Several inserters are in a waiting state due to lack of source items. Ensure that the supply chain is continuous and that there are no bottlenecks in the flow of materials.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of various items, including 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
