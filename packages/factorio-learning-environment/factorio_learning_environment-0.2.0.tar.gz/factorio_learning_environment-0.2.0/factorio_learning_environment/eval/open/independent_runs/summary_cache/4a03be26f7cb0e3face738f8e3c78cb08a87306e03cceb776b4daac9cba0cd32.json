{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) which is actively working, fueled, and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) with coal fuel, currently waiting for space in destination due to output blockage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items as the chest is full.\n- Transport Belt system aligned correctly at positions (43.5, -82.5), (43.5, -80.5), and (43.5, -79.5), facilitating the movement of mined resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity available to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest\n- Regularly check and empty the chest to ensure the Burner Inserter can continue to function without waiting for space.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
