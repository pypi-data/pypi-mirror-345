{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at position(x=35-41, y=-85 to -87)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (37.0, -85.0), (39.0, -85.0), and (41.0, -86.0)\n- Storage chests at positions (36.5, -86.5), (40.5, -87.5), and (39.5, -83.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (35.5, -86.5) and (35.5, -85.5)\n\n### Iron/Copper Mining Area at position(x=-28, y=-61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0)\n- Input chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5)\n- Burner inserters at (-26.5, -59.5) and (-25.5, -58.5)\n\n### Iron Processing Line at position(x=0-6, y=0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5)\n- Input inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5)\n- Output inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n\n### Power Generation System at position(x=-3.5 to 4.5, y=17-27)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5, 22.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 20.5)\n- Connected pipe network\n- Electric poles extending from (7.5, 20.5) to (10.5, 12.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to research\n- Cannot research technologies that are already researched. Check technology prerequisites and current research state before starting new research.\n\n### Errors related to inserter placement and operation\n- Multiple inserters are waiting for source items or blocked by items on ground\n- Ensure proper input/output connections between inserters and target entities\n- Clear blocked transport belts to allow inserters to function properly\n\n### Fluid system connection errors\n- Steam engine shows \"no input liquid\" warning\n- Ensure proper pipe connections between boiler and steam engine\n- Verify fluid flow direction and connection points\n\n### Power system warnings\n- Boiler shows \"out of fuel\" warning\n- Ensure continuous fuel supply to power generating equipment"}
