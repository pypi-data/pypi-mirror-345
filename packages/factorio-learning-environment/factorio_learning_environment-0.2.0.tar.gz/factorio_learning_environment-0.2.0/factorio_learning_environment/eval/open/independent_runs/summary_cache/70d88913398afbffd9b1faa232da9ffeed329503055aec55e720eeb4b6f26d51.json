{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with a current status of EntityStatus.WORKING. It has a fuel source of coal (currently 0) and is processing iron ore (currently 4).\n\n### Iron ore mine at position (-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (-15.5, -50.5)) for harvesting iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has available inventory space before attempting to insert items. The last error indicates that the furnace was full, preventing the insertion of coal.\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to insert iron ore into the furnace when the coal count is zero, as this will not allow the furnace to operate. Ensure fuel is available before inserting additional materials.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to furnace ingredient status\n- Monitor the ingredient status of the furnace to ensure it has the necessary items to operate. If the furnace reports \"EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS,\" check the inventory to confirm that required items are available.\n- Ensure that there are enough iron ore items in the inventory to keep the furnace operational.\n\n### Errors when the furnace runs out of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of the furnace. If the coal count reaches zero, the furnace will stop working. Ensure a steady supply of coal to maintain operation."}
