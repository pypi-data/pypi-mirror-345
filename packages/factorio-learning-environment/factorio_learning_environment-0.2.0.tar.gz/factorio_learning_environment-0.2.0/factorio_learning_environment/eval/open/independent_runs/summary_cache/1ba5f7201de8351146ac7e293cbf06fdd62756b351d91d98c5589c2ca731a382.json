{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) and Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0), both fueled and operational.\n- Burner Inserters positioned at (1.5, -0.5), (3.5, -0.5), (-0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 2.5), and (3.5, 2.5) with correct orientations for supplying and removing items from the furnaces.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, 1.5) for storing produced iron plates, though currently empty.\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup with multiple belts connecting various points, though specific connections are not detailed in the logs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to retrieve it. For instance, attempting to get a transport belt at a position where none exists will cause an error.\n\n### Errors in connecting incompatible entities\n- When connecting entities, ensure compatibility. For example, belts cannot be directly connected to a wooden chest; use an inserter for such connections.\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items for placement\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the item is available in the inventory. Attempting to place a burner inserter without having one in the inventory will result in an error."}
