{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these components, starting at Position (x=21.5, y=-10.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with small electric poles connecting the generator components\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=3.5, y=0.5) connected to the Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storage\n- Various Inserters and Transport Belts for item movement\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in production\n- Regularly check your production facilities to ensure they have the necessary ingredients to operate. For instance, the assembling machine cannot produce copper cables due to a shortage of copper plates.\n\n### Errors when inserters are blocked\n- Ensure that there is space in the destination for inserters to place items. If an inserter's output is blocked, it will wait until there is space available."}
