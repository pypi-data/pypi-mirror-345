{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), and (44.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-13.5, -49.5), (-12.5, -49.5), (-9.5, -49.5), (-17.5, -47.5), (-16.5, -47.5), (-15.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -47.5), (-12.5, -45.5), (-10.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-8.5, -45.5), (-12.5, -43.5), (-10.5, -43.5), (-8.5, -43.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), (-8.5, -49.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), (-8.5, -44.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors When Extracting Items from Chests\n- Ensure that the quantity to be extracted is greater than zero before attempting to extract items from a chest. This prevents errors related to attempting to extract non-existent quantities.\n\n#### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills and inserters from halting operations due to lack of space for output.\n\n#### Inserter Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all burner inserters are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation and prevent stoppages due to lack of fuel.\n\n#### Smelting Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings and downtime due to \"no ingredients to smelt\" status."}
