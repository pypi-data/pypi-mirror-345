{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a single stone furnace placed at position (0.0, 0.0). The furnace is currently fueled with 34 units of coal. It has processed copper ore into 18 copper plates but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nA stone furnace placed at position (2.0, 0.0). This furnace is fueled with 25 units of coal. It has processed copper ore into 18 copper plates but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\nA stone furnace placed at position (5.0, 5.0). This furnace is fueled with 7 units of coal and has processed iron ore into 17 iron plates but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump placed at position (4.5, -10.5). The pump is currently not connected to any fluid systems and has no fluid present in its connections.\n\n### Offshore Pump and Boiler System\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0) out of fuel\n- Pipe Group connecting from position (19.5, -2.5) to (18.5, -3.5)\n\nThe offshore pump is connected to a fluid system and is working. The boiler is out of fuel and not producing steam.\n\n### Steam Engine and Pipe System\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting from position (21.5, -10.5) to (20.5, -5.5)\n\nThe steam engine is placed but not yet connected to the power network. The pipe system is partially connected but requires further connections to complete the fluid circuit.\n\n### Lab at position (10.5, -4.5)\nA lab placed at position (10.5, -4.5). The lab is currently not powered and has no input materials for research.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the entity you want to place is available in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace or a boiler without having it in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all the required materials in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, and attempting to craft it without sufficient stones will cause an error.\n- Ensure you have all the necessary ingredients before attempting to craft. For example, attempting to craft an Offshore Pump without having enough iron-gear-wheels or pipes will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when trying to find non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to locate exists on the map. For example, attempting to find the nearest stone furnace when none has been placed will result in an error.\n- Make sure the entity you are trying to find, such as a steam engine or boiler, is actually placed on the map. Attempting to locate a steam engine or boiler when none exists will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients in furnaces\n- Make sure to have the necessary fuel and ingredients in your inventory before attempting to use a furnace. For instance, trying to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in your inventory will cause an error.\n\n### Errors when attempting to use unavailable furnaces\n- Ensure that you have additional stone furnaces available in your inventory before attempting to place or use them. An assertion error will occur if you try to use a furnace when none are available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the items you wish to insert into a structure in your inventory. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft without unlocking technology\n- Ensure that you have researched the necessary technology before attempting to craft items that require it. For example, attempting to craft an assembling machine without unlocking the automation technology will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when attempting to use unavailable assembling machines\n- Ensure that you have assembling machines available in your inventory before attempting to place or use them. An assertion error will occur if you try to use an assembling machine when none are available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors due to lack of crafting machines for specific recipes\n- Some items require specific crafting machines or smelting in a furnace. For example, crafting copper plates requires a furnace. Ensure you have access to the necessary equipment before attempting to craft such items.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces without valid contents\n- Ensure that the furnace has valid"}
