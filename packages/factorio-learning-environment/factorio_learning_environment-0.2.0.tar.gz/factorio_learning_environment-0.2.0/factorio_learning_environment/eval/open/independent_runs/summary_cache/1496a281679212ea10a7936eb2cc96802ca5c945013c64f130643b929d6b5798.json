{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, processing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items to a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) serving as an intermediary storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) moving items from the chest to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) moving items from the belt to a wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Copper Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, processing copper ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (11.5, 0.5) transferring items to a wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions (40.5, -83.5) to (38.5, -83.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing wooden chests\n- Ensure the target position is unoccupied and valid before attempting to place a wooden chest. Multiple attempts to place a wooden chest at positions (44.0, -83.0), (45.0, -83.0), (45.0, -84.0), (46.0, -83.0), (13.5, 0.5), (14.0, 0.5), and (14.5, 0.5) failed due to occupied or invalid positions.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Verify that the entity from which you are attempting to extract items exists and contains the desired items. An attempt to extract coal from a wooden chest at (40.5, -83.5) failed because the entity was not found or did not contain coal.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity for inserters contains items to be moved. Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5) and (11.5, 0.5) are waiting for source items, indicating that the source may be empty or not producing items."}
