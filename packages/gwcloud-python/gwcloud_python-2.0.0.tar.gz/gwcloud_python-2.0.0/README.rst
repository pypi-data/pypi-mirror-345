GWCloud Python API
==================

`GWCloud <https://gwcloud.org.au/>`_ is a service used to handle both the submission of `Bilby <https://pypi.org/project/bilby/>`_ jobs to a supercomputer queue and the obtaining of the results produced by these jobs.
While there is a web interface for this service, which is recommended for beginners, this package can be used to allow Bilby job submission and manipulation from Python scripts.

Check out the `documentation <https://gwcloud-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.
