{"content": "The error indicates that the furnace's inventory is full, preventing additional coal from being inserted. This suggests that the furnace might already have enough fuel or that the input slots are occupied. Let's address this by ensuring the furnace has enough space and resources to operate effectively.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Check Furnace Inventory:**\n   - Verify the current inventory of the furnace to understand its contents and ensure there is space for processing.\n\n2. **Ensure Fuel and Ore Balance:**\n   - If the furnace is already full of coal, no additional coal is needed. Focus on ensuring that copper ore is being processed.\n\n3. **Free Up Inventory Space:**\n   - Since the furnace's output was full, we already extracted iron plates. Now, ensure that the input slots are not overloaded with copper ore.\n\n4. **Verify Furnace Operation:**\n   - Confirm that the furnace is set to process copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Verify the furnace inventory\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(\"Current Furnace Inventory:\", furnace_inventory)\n\n# Step 2: Check if the furnace has sufficient coal and copper ore\ncoal_in_furnace = furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\ncopper_ore_in_furnace = furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0)\n\n# Step 3: If the furnace is full of copper ore, ensure it is processing\nif copper_ore_in_furnace > 0 and furnace_entity.status == EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT:\n    print(\"Furnace is full. Ensure it processes the copper ore.\")\n    # Wait for processing\n    sleep(10)\n\n# Step 4: Check the furnace status again after waiting\nfurnace_inventory_after_wait = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(\"Furnace Inventory After Wait:\", furnace_inventory_after_wait)\n\n# Step 5: Extract copper plates if produced\ncopper_plates = furnace_inventory_after_wait.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\nif copper_plates > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, furnace_entity.position, copper_plates)\n    print(f\"Extracted {copper_plates} copper plates.\")\n\n    # Proceed with crafting\n    craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable)\n    crafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\n    assert crafted_poles > 0, \"Failed to craft the small electric pole.\"\n\n    # Place the electric pole\n    pole_position = Position(x=4.0, y=3.0)\n    electric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, direction=Direction.UP, position=pole_position)\n    assert electric_pole, \"Failed to place the small electric pole.\"\n    print(\"Electric pole placed successfully.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No copper plates produced. Check furnace operation and ensure it is not overloaded.\")\n\n# Final inventory check\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final Inventory: {final_inventory}\")\n```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- Ensure the furnace has a balanced input of coal and copper ore.\n- Avoid overloading the furnace with more resources than it can process.\n- Regularly check the furnace status to ensure it is actively processing materials.", "summary_range": "[1-150]"}
