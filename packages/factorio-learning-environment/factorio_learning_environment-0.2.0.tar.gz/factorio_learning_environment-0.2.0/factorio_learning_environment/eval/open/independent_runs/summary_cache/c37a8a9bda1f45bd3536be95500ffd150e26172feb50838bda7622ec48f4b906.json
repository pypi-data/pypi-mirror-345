{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -47.5) transferring items from the furnace at (-18.0, -49.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -47.5) transferring items from the furnace at (-16.0, -49.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) transferring items from the furnace at (-14.0, -49.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) transferring items from the wooden chest.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -45.5) transferring items from the wooden chest.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -45.5) transferring items from the wooden chest.\n- Iron Chest at position (-12.5, -44.5) storing items transferred by the burner inserters.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- Belt group connecting positions (-16.5, -46.5) to (-16.5, -48.5), facilitating the movement of items between furnaces and inserters.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placement is 10 units.\n\n### Errors in entity retrieval due to incorrect position\n- Verify the position of the entity before attempting to retrieve or interact with it to ensure the entity exists at the specified location."}
