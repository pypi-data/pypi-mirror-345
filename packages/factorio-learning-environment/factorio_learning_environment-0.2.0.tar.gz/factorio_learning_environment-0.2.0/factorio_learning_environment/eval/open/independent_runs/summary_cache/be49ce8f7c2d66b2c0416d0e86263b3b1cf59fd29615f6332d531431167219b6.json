{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with coal as fuel. It is currently working and has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5). The chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel. It is currently working and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) with coal as fuel. It is waiting for source items and is connected to the wooden chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when refueling mining drills\n- Ensure there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel the mining drill to avoid interruptions in mining operations.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage. This will ensure continuous operation and resource collection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
