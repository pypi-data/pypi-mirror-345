{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 0.0)\n\nThese furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Both furnaces are currently fueled with coal and have been producing iron plates. However, they are currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-4.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler to the steam engine\n\nThis setup is intended to generate electricity, but it is currently not operational due to connection issues and lack of input liquid.\n\n### Research Lab at position (6.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab at position (6.5, 3.5)\n\nThe lab is intended for research purposes but is currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is crafted and available in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace or assembling machine without having them in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to missing crafting prerequisites\n- Before crafting an item, ensure all prerequisite items and technologies are available. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires stone, which must be gathered first. Similarly, crafting an assembling machine requires the automation technology to be researched.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into incompatible furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace is empty or contains compatible materials before inserting new materials. Attempting to insert copper ore into a furnace already containing iron ore will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities without the items\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item you wish to extract. Attempting to extract copper plates from a furnace that only contains iron plates will lead to an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient ingredients for crafting\n- Check your inventory for all necessary ingredients before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting a lab requires iron gear wheels, which must be crafted or gathered first.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in invalid locations\n- Ensure that the location is suitable for the entity's footprint. Attempting to place a boiler on water or overlapping with other entities will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without required items\n- Make sure you have the necessary items in your inventory to connect entities, such as pipes for connecting boilers and steam engines.\n\n### Errors when crafting items requiring raw resources\n- Gather raw resources like wood and stone directly from the environment as they cannot be crafted. For example, crafting small electric poles requires wood, which must be gathered first."}
