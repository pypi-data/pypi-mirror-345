{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple wooden chests positioned at:\n  - Position(x=-9.5, y=-50.5) with 1445 iron plates\n  - Position(x=-8.5, y=-50.5) with 1445 iron plates\n  - Position(x=-7.5, y=-50.5) with 665 iron plates\n  - Position(x=-6.5, y=-50.5) with 1250 iron plates\n  - Position(x=-10.5, y=-50.5) with 1600 iron plates (full)\n  - Position(x=-11.5, y=-50.5) with 1590 iron plates\n- Iron chest at Position(x=-5.5, y=-50.5) with 1700 iron plates and 326 iron ore\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a warning about a full chest at drop position\n- Wooden chests positioned at:\n  - Position(x=4.5, y=-58.5) with 284 iron ore\n  - Position(x=5.5, y=-60.5) with 183 iron plates\n  - Position(x=6.5, y=-60.5) with 183 iron plates\n  - Position(x=7.5, y=-60.5) with 183 iron plates\n  - Position(x=8.5, y=-60.5) with 183 iron plates\n  - Position(x=9.5, y=-60.5) with 183 iron plates\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with warnings about no ingredients and full result inventory\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with similar warnings\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with similar warnings\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources or smelted products have sufficient capacity to prevent operation halts. Regularly monitor and empty chests to maintain workflow.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials to prevent production stoppages. Regularly check and refill the furnace source inventories.\n\n### Warnings from Mining Drills\n- Address warnings from mining drills about full chests at drop positions by emptying or replacing the chests to continue resource collection.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- Utility functions and variables are not explicitly defined in the logs provided.\n- Important Variables:\n  - `iron-plate`: int, total count in inventory is 4284\n  - `iron-ore`: int, total count in inventory is 150\n  - `coal`: int, total count in inventory is 30\n  - `wood`: int, total count in inventory is 10\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int, total count in inventory is 4"}
