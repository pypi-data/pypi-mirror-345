If an entity already exists at the target position, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or altering the reference position before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Before attempting to place an entity, verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory. If not, craft or gather the required items to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities for the inserters have the necessary items available. Check the input chests or other source entities to ensure they are not empty and are correctly connected to the inserters."}
