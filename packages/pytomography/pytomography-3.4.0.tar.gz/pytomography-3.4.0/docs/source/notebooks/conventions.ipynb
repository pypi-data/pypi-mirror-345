    "A positive scanner angle $\\beta$ in the DICOM standard is defines as a counterclockwise rotation of angle $\\beta$ from 12 o'clock when looking into the scanner. When compared to the standard azimuthal angle our defined cartesian coordinate system, it follows that $\\phi = 3 \\pi / 2 - \\beta$. Since $\\beta$ is defined in the range $[0, 2\\pi]$ it follows that $\\phi$ is defined in the range $[-\\pi/2, 3\\pi/2]$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Objects and projections are stored using pytorch's `torch.Tensor` class. The dimensions of objects are $[B, L_x, L_y, L_z]$ and the dimensions of images are $[B,...]$ where ... depends on the imaging modality. $B$ represents the batch dimension, and may correspond to different energy windows, time gates, or bed positions.\n",

    "* $f$ refers to an object, and $f_j$ refers to the value of the object at voxel $j$\n",
    "* $g$ refers to a set of projections, and $g_i$ refers to the value of the projections at detector element $i$\n",
    "* $H$ refers to the system matrix with components $H_{ij}$: the contribution voxel $j$ in object space makes to detector element $j$ in image space\n",
    "\n",
    "This section establishes a mathematical paradigm for tomography in medical imaging, and is thus mostly intended for those who wish to use PyTomography to implement novel reconstruction algorithms. It is still useful, however, for everyone to know.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Projections\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTomography is built around two fundamental operations used in image reconstruction: **Forward Projection** and **Back Projection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Forward Projection**: Takes an object $a$ (in vector space $\\mathbb{U}$) and maps to to an image $b$ (in vector space $\\mathbb{V}$) using the system matrix: $b_i = \\sum_{i} H_{ij} a_j$ (or $b = Ha$). This operation is implemented by the `forward` method a `SystemMatrix` class corresponding to a particular imaging modality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Back Projection**: Takes an image $b$ (in vector space $\\mathbb{V}$) and maps to to an image $\\hat{a}$ (in vector space $\\mathbb{U}$) using the system matrix: $\\hat{a}_i = \\sum_{i} H_{ij} b_i$ (or $\\hat{a}=H^T b$). This operation is implemented by the `backward` method of a `SystemMatrix` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that projections map between distinct vector space $H:\\mathbb{U} \\to \\mathbb{V}$. This makes them distinct from **transforms**, which are discussed next.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ordered subset algorithms, it is useful \n",
    "\n",
    "### Transforms\n",
    "Consider the case of of a 128x128x128 object being scanned at 64 different angles, each with resolution 128x128: in this situation, the object is a vector of length 2097152 and the image is a vector of length 1048576. If each component $H_{ij}$ is stored using an 8 byte float, the system matrix would require 17.6TB of harddrive space to store. Fortunately, $H$ is a sparse matrix containing mostly zeros, and can be implemented using efficient techniques. One of the building blocks for these techniques is the **transform**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it's useful to decompose $H$ into a combination of operations consisting of square matrices $A_i:\\mathbb{U}\\to\\mathbb{U}$ (object to object) and $B_i:\\mathbb{V}\\to \\mathbb{V}$ (image to image) and a single projection operator $P:\\mathbb{U} \\to \\mathbb{V}$ (object to image). The $A_i$'s and $B_i$'s are known as **transforms** and can be used to model phenomena such as atteunation/PSF in SPECT/PET.\n",
    "\n",
    "A peculiar feature of most imaging modalities is that they can be decomposed into a series of projections: namely, that image space $\\mathbb{V}$ consists of a sequence of *projections*. In SPECT, this corresponds to a particular rotation of the scanner, while in 3D PET, this corresponds to a particular rotatation *and* difference between axial detection coordinates of a photon pair. In either case, we can choose to express the image as $g = \\sum_{\\theta} g_{\\theta} \\otimes \\hat{\\theta}$ where $\\theta$ corresponds to a particular projection, and $\\hat{\\theta}$ is a unit vector that represents a specific projection. Note that $g$ and $g_{\\theta}$ therefor **do not** lie in the same vector space. In this paradigm, we can represent $H$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = \\sum_{\\theta} \\left(\\prod_i B_i(\\theta) \\right) P(\\theta) \\left(\\prod_i A_i(\\theta) \\right) \\otimes \\hat{\\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement back projection, we also need $H^T$, which can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H^T = \\sum_{\\theta} \\left(\\prod_{i,\\text{reverse}} A_i^T(\\theta) \\right) P^T(\\theta) \\left(\\prod_{i,\\text{reverse}} B_i^T(\\theta) \\right) \\otimes \\hat{\\theta}^T$$\n",

    "**Example:**: Modeling of a SPECT scanner can be written as $H_{\\text{SPECT}} = \\sum_{\\theta} P(\\theta) A_1(\\theta) A_2(\\theta) \\otimes \\hat{\\theta}$. Consider a particular projection: say $\\theta = 10^{\\circ}$. The operator $A_2(10^{\\circ})$ implements atteunation modeling when the object is being projected at a scanner angle of $10^{\\circ}$. It will adjust the object based on the amount of attenuating material photons have to travel through to reach the scanner at that particular angle. The matrix $A_1$ (which is independent of scanner angle for a circular orbit) implements PSF blurring for that particular projection by blurring planes parallel to the $10^{\\circ}$ scanner based on the distance between the plane and the scanner. The matrix $P(\\theta)$ sums all the voxels together in the direction of the scanner, turning a 3D object into a 2D projection. The projection at that particular angle becomes $g_{10^{\\circ}} = P(\\theta) A_1(\\theta) A_2(\\theta) f$ and the corresponding image (containing only 1 projection) would be $g = g_{10^{\\circ}} \\otimes \\hat{10^{\\circ}} = P(\\theta) A_1(\\theta) A_2(\\theta) f \\otimes \\hat{10^{\\circ}}$ The net image (consisting of all projections) requires summing over all the different projections: $g = \\sum_{\\theta} g_{\\theta} \\otimes \\hat{\\theta}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**: Modeling of a PET scanner (2D mode, no scatter) can be written as $H_{\\text{PET}} = \\sum_{\\theta} B_1(\\theta) B_2(\\theta) P(\\theta) \\otimes \\hat{\\theta}$. The operator $B_2(\\theta)$ implements atteunation modeling in PET. Unlike SPECT, where attenuation modeling is done in object space, it is implemented for PET in image space due to the fact that the probability of detection is adjusted by the same value for each LOR in PET. The matrix $B_1$ implements PSF blurring: unlike in SPECT, it is assumed that the blurring is constant as a function from distance to the scanner, and thus the operation can be implemented in image space. The matrix $P(\\theta)$ sums all the voxels together in the direction of the scanner, turning a 3D object into a 2D projection.\n",

    "### Reconstruction Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In realtity, the object $f$ (and hence the image $g$) are random vectors, while the system matrix $H$ is deterministic. In addition, only the vector $g$ is measured. For notational simplicity, we'll let $\\tilde{f}$ represent the random vector, and $f=E[\\tilde{f}]$ represent the mean value of $f$. This notation will be convention for the entire manual and API. As such, we can write $g=H\\tilde{f}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard reconstruction algorithm for PET and SPECT is known as the **ordered-subsets expectation maximum** (OSEM) algorithm. It assumes that $\\tilde{f}$ (and hence $g$) is a Poisson random vector, which holds when $\\tilde{f}$ represents the number of emissions from a radionuclide in a spatial location and in a given time interval. Before we begin the derivation, we define a new matrix $\\tilde{F}$ such that $\\tilde{F}_{ij} = H_{ji} \\tilde{f}_i$. The components of $\\tilde{F}$ denoted $\\tilde{F}_{ij}$ represent the number of counts from voxel $i$ in image space contributing to pixel $j$ in image space. Since $F$ is a random vector that counts number of emissions, it is also Poisson with $\\tilde{F} \\sim \\text{Poisson}(F)$. We now seek a maximum liklihood solution for $f$, and write the liklihood function for probability density function as\n",

    "\n",
    "Setting $\\nabla_{f} \\ln L(\\tilde{f},f) = 0$ simply yields $f = \\tilde{f}$. In reality, however, we measure $g$, not $\\tilde{f}$, so we need to obtain $\\bar{f}$ as some function of $f$. As such, the standard maximum liklihood technique will not work. What we can do, however, is consider the quantity:\n",

It yields the expected value of the log-liklihood, given the measured projection data $g$ **and** a \"guess\" about what the distribution would look like: $f^{(n)}$. There's just one question: what does $E_f[H_{ji}\\tilde{f}_i|g, f^{(n)}]$ (i.e. the expected number of emissions from voxel $i$ contributing to image pixel $j$) look like? I claim\n",
