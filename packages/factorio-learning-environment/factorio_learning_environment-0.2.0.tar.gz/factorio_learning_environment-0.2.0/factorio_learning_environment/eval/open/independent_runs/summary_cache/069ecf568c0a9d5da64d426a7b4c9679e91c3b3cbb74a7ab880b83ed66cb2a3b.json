{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), refueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring iron ore from the chests to the furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), storing processed iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a storage chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron plates from a storage chest to another location.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) and (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), used for storing and transferring iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to transfer. Regularly check and refill the source if necessary.\n\n### No Iron Plates Available in Input Chest\n- Verify that the input chest has a sufficient supply of iron plates. Consider increasing the production rate or adjusting the supply chain to maintain a steady flow.\n\n### No Iron Ore Available in Ore Chest\n- Ensure that the ore chest is regularly refilled with iron ore. This may require increasing the mining rate or optimizing the logistics chain.\n\n### Inserter Blocked at Drop Position\n- Check that the destination for the inserter is not full or blocked. Adjust the logistics to ensure there is space available for the inserter to drop items.\n\n### Error When Accessing Non-Existent Entity\n- Verify the existence of entities before attempting to access them. Ensure that the entity type and position are correct to avoid exceptions."}
