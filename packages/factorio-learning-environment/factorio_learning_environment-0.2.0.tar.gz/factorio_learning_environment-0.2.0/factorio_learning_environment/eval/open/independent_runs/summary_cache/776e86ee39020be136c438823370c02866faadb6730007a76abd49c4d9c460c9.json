{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a furnace located at (5.0, 5.0) that was used to process iron ore and coal into iron plates. This structure supports the production chain required for crafting sub-components needed in lab construction.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at position (-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace located at (-27.0, -60.0) that was used to process copper ore and coal into copper plates. This structure is integral to meeting copper resource requirements for crafting processes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 When invoking the get_entities API, ensure that the arguments match the expected signature. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or adding extra positional arguments.\n  \n\u2022 When a function may return None (for instance, when retrieving entities), validate the result and convert it to an empty list to prevent iteration errors.\n  \n\u2022 Prior to initiating lab crafting, verify that all necessary prerequisite ingredients (such as sufficient iron plates for iron-gear-wheels, copper plates for copper-cable production, and the resulting electronic circuits) are available. This helps avoid crafting failures due to missing sub-ingredients.\n  \n\u2022 Before attempting to place a structure (for example, a Lab at a designated position), confirm that the required item is present in the inventory and that placement conditions are met to prevent placement failures.\n  \n\u2022 Maintain consistency in API usage and resource management during recovery attempts so that earlier errors in parameter usage or resource shortages do not compound in subsequent operations."}
