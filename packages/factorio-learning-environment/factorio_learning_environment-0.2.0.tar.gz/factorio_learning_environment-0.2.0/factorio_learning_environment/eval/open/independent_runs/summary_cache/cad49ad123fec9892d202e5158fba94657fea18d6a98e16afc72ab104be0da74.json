{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -49.5) used to transfer items between entities. It is positioned to transfer items from a wooden chest to the stone furnace and vice versa.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) used for storing materials and products.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have sufficient items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors with inserter fuel management\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to avoid warnings like \"out of fuel\" which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with inserter orientation\n- Verify the direction of inserters to ensure they are correctly aligned with their source and destination entities. This will prevent issues with item transfer, as seen with the repeated need to rotate the inserter at position (-12.5, -49.5)."}
