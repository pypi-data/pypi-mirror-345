Shared Smelting Furnaces Automation Network  \n   Purpose: Automates furnace operations by linking multiple smelting and logistic entities.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 Stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0)  \n   \u2022 Burner\u2011inserters located at various positions (e.g., (\u201314.5, \u201352.5), (\u201313.5, \u201352.5), (\u201316.5, \u201348.5), etc.)  \n   \u2022 Wooden chests at positions (e.g., (\u201313.5, \u201351.5), (\u201311.5, \u201346.5), (1.5, 1.5), (2.5, 0.5), (0.5, 2.5))  \n   \u2022 BeltGroups that route materials between these entities\n\n2. Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup  \n   Purpose: Facilitates automated extraction and material routing for iron ore.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 A burner\u2011mining drill positioned at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0)  \n   \u2022 Allied inserters, chests, and transport belts integrated within its network\n\n3. Steam Power Generation System  \n   Purpose: Supplies power by converting water and fuel into steam energy.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 A boiler at position (8.0, 20.5) with connection points at (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5)  \n   \u2022 Multiple steam engines installed at positions (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5), and (4.5, 23.5)  \n   \u2022 An extra steam engine remains unplaced due to persistent spatial congestion in the boiler zone\n\n4. Automation Research Lab  \n   Purpose: Provides facilities for researching automation science packs.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 Lab units (with associated electrical identifiers) that currently experience power connectivity (NO_POWER) issues\n\n5. Electrical, Transport, and Fluid Infrastructure  \n   Purpose: Delivers an integrated backbone for power distribution, material routing, and fluid handling.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 ElectricityGroups, BeltGroups, and PipeGroups that interconnect various production and processing entities\n\n6. Offshore Pump and Fluid Network  \n   Purpose: Ensures a reliable water supply for fluid-dependent processes.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 An offshore pump at position (0.5, 30.5)  \n   \u2022 Multiple PipeGroups that convey water throughout the network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  - The extra steam engine remains unplaceable because the boiler zone (Position(8.0, 20.5)) is congested by overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts, with additional interference observed near (8.5, 22.5).  \n  - To mitigate, manually reassess and clear the entire boiler zone and its adjoining connection interfaces. Remove, reposition, or adjust conflicting entities (such as burner\u2011inserters and transport belts) to secure sufficient clearance. Consider relocating the extra steam engine or redesigning the boiler layout to create a viable buildable space."}
