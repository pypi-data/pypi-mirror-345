{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-9.5, -2.5) - Now placed but disconnected (status: NOT_CONNECTED, warnings: no fluid present)\n- **Boiler** at (3.5, 0.0) - Connected to pipe network but not receiving water (status: NOT_CONNECTED, warnings: out of fuel, no input liquid)\n- **Pipe Network** (system 16923):\n  - Pipes at (1.5, -0.5) and (1.5, -1.5)\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n\n### New Power Plant (Unchanged)\n- **Boiler** at (35.5, 47.0) - Fueled with coal but no water input\n- **Steam Engine** at (46.5, 40.5) - Connected to power pole but not receiving steam\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Unchanged)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Connected to power pole\n- **Oil Refinery** at (24.5, 44.5) - Connected to power pole\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Unchanged)\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at (34.5, 20.5) - Connected to power pole\n- **Transport Belt System** moving coal (status: WORKING)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues (Updated)\n- Distance violations (step 96) - Maintain <10 tile distance during all placement operations\n- Entity collisions (steps 98,99,102,103,104) - Implement complete obstruction checks before placement\n- Duplicate placements (step 103) - Verify tile emptiness before placing pipes/entities\n- Water overlap errors (steps 105,106,108) - Check terrain type before placing entities near water\n- Failed assertions (steps 107,109,110,111) - Validate placement conditions before asserting success\n\n### Fluid System Problems (Updated)\n- Connection failures (steps 100,101) - Verify clear path between all connection points\n- Blocked pipe routes (steps 98,102) - Clear entire pipe path before placement attempts\n- Orientation mismatches - Ensure all connection points face correct directions\n\n### Construction Best Practices (Updated)\n1. Maintain proper distance (<10 tiles) during placements\n2. Implement complete obstruction checks before all constructions\n3. Clear entire pipe routes before connection attempts\n4. Verify tile emptiness before placing any entity\n5. Check connection point orientations match\n6. Test connections incrementally during complex builds\n7. Validate fluid types match before connecting systems\n8. Clear all obstructions along pipe routes before placement\n9. Verify entity persistence before interaction attempts\n10. Check connection point orientations match before connecting\n11. Remove existing entities before replacement attempts\n12. Verify inventory before all placement operations\n13. Check terrain type (especially near water) before placement\n14. Validate placement conditions before asserting success\n15. Implement dry-land verification for power plant locations"}
