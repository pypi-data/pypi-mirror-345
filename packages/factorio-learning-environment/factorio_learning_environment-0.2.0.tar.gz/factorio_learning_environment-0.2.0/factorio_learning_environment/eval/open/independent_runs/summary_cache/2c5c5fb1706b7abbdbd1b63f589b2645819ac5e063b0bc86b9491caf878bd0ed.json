{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mining Structure at position (41, -82)\nConsists of a burner-mining-drill at position (41, -82) and two chests at positions (40.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Inserter Structure at position (39.5, -81.5)\nConsists of a burner-inserter at position (39.5, -81.5) connected to the coal mining structure.\n\n### Furnace Structure at position (0, 0)\nConsists of a stone-furnace at position (0, 0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when extracting coal from chest**: \n  - Make sure the chest is not full before attempting to extract coal.\n  - Check the chest's inventory to ensure it has coal to extract.\n* **Errors when inserting coal into drill**: \n  - Ensure the drill's inventory is not full before attempting to insert coal.\n  - Check the drill's fuel level to ensure it can accept more coal.\n* **Errors when mining coal**: \n  - Ensure the chest at the drop position is not full before mining coal.\n  - Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* **Utility Functions**:\n  + `extract_item`: Extracts items from a chest. Failure modes: chest is full, no items to extract. Success modes: items extracted successfully.\n  + `insert_item`: Inserts items into a drill. Failure modes: drill's inventory is full, cannot insert items. Success modes: items inserted successfully.\n* **Important Variables**:\n  + `coal_chest`: The chest used to store coal. Type: Chest\n  + `drill`: The burner-mining-drill used to mine coal. Type: BurnerMiningDrill\n  + `inserter`: The burner-inserter used to connect the coal mining structure. Type: BurnerInserter\n  + `furnace`: The stone-furnace used to smelt coal. Type: Furnace"}
