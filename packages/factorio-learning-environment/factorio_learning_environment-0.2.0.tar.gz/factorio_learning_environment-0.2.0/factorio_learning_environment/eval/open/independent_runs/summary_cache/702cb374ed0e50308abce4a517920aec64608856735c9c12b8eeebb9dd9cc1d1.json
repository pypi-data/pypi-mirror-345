{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), which is currently out of fuel and has an iron ore resource.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0), which is out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0), which has coal as fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Mining Drills\n- Ensure that there is a viable place to put the Burner Mining Drill near the intended position. If not, consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in the inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for extraction\n- Ensure that the mining drills have access to the resources they are intended to extract. If resources are depleted, reposition the drill or find a new resource patch.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `nearest_buildable`: Attempts to find the nearest buildable position for a given prototype and building box. Failed due to no viable position found.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `new_copper_drill_position`: Position for placing a new copper drill, which failed due to no viable location.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity for inserting items, which encountered errors due to insufficient coal.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity for inserting items, which encountered errors due to insufficient coal."}
