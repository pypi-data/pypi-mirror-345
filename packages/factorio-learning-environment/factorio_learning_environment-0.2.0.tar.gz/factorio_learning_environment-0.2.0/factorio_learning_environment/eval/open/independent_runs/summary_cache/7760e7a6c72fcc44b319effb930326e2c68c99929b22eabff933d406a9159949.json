{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups for water and steam circulation\n- Electric pole network connecting various parts of the factory\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\nLocated around position(8.5, 13.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position(8.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear inserter at position(8.5, 11.5)\n- Iron gear chest at position(8.5, 10.5)\n- Output chest at position(11.5, 13.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for material handling\n- Transport belt system with 11 belts\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups:\n1. First Setup:\n   - Burner mining drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\n   - Wooden chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at position(41.5, -79.5)\n\n2. Second Setup:\n   - Burner mining drill at position(-28.0, -61.0)\n   - Wooden chest and inserter system\n   - Stone furnace at position(-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest with iron plates\n\n3. Third Setup:\n   - Burner mining drill at position(-18.0, -53.0)\n   - Stone furnace at position(-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Input/output chest system\n   - Multiple burner inserters for automation\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Common colliding entities: wooden chests, transport belts, electric poles\n- Increase spacing or change direction when placing entities near existing structures\n\n### Inserter Placement Issues\n- Ensure proper spacing when placing inserters next to assembling machines\n- Consider the direction and spacing requirements for inserter placement\n- Verify that the target position is clear of other entities\n\n### Structure Layout Problems\n- Plan the layout considering the space requirements of all components\n- Leave adequate space between production lines\n- Consider the direction of material flow when placing inserters and chests\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner devices\n- Ensure proper material flow between production stages\n- Monitor input/output chest contents for production efficiency"}
