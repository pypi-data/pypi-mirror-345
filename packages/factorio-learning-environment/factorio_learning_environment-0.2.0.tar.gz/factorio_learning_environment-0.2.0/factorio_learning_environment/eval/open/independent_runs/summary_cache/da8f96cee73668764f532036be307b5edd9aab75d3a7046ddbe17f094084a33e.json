{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-73.5, 2.5)\nConsists of two furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, -73.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal as fuel (21 units each) but currently have no iron ore to process. They each contain 1 iron plate in their output.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-69.0, 4.0)\nConsists of two furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, -69.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (5.0, -69.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal as fuel (23 units each) but currently have no copper ore to process. Their output inventories are empty.\n\n### Research Lab at (0.5, -79.5)\nSingle lab structure loaded with 10 automation science packs and set to research Automation technology. Currently not operational due to lack of power.\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-43.5, -125.5)\n- Boiler at position (-33.5, -115.0)\nCurrently disconnected and non-operational. Boiler has no fuel and no water input.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities without required items in inventory\n- Before attempting to place structures like furnaces, labs, or pumps, ensure you have the required items in your inventory\n- If placement fails, check recipe requirements and craft necessary items first\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items that are not in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items (like coal) into entities, verify that you have the required items in your inventory\n- If you need to insert fuel, make sure to harvest or craft the necessary fuel items first\n\n### Errors related to furnace operation\n- Monitor furnace input inventories to ensure continuous operation\n- Currently all furnaces are idle due to lack of ore input, consider restocking ore supplies when furnaces run empty\n\n### Power-related errors\n- Research labs require power to function\n- Ensure power generation infrastructure is set up and connected to labs before expecting them to operate\n\n### Fluid system connection errors\n- When attempting to connect fluid entities, ensure you have pipes in your inventory\n- Current attempt to connect offshore pump to boiler failed due to missing pipes in inventory\n- Plan the pipe connection path before attempting to connect distant fluid entities\n- The distance between offshore pump (-43.5, -125.5) and boiler (-33.5, -115.0) requires multiple pipes to bridge the gap\n\n### Boiler setup errors\n- Boiler requires both fuel and water input to function\n- Ensure boiler is properly connected to water source and has adequate fuel supply\n- Current boiler shows multiple warnings: out of fuel, no input liquid, and no fluid connections"}
