{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace 1 at Position (-14.0, -49.0) and Furnace 2 at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -47.5) which transfers items between furnaces and belts\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -46.5) for storing items\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnaces and chests\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group for water transport at multiple positions\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup 1: Inputs from Position (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5), Outputs from Position (-8.5, -45.5) to (-8.5, -43.5)\n- BeltGroup 2: Inputs from Position (-12.5, -44.5) to (-12.5, -46.5), Outputs from Position (-12.5, -45.5) to (-11.5, -46.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items and that the source is not empty to avoid waiting status.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process, such as ores, to avoid idle status."}
