{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, spanning positions from (-9.5, 23.5) to (1.5, 23.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with a fuel inventory of coal\n\n### Inserter and Storage System at Position (6.5, -60.5)\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Research Lab at Position (Not specified)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Electricity Entities\n- Ensure all electricity entities like inserters and labs are connected to a power network and receiving power. Check connections and ensure the steam engine is operational and connected to the power grid.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Verify that the items you intend to insert are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to insert it into the boiler.\n\n### Errors when Starting Research\n- Ensure that the research lab is properly set up with the necessary science packs and is powered before attempting to start research.\n\n### Errors when Using API Functions\n- When using functions like `get_entities`, ensure that the parameters are correct and that the function is called within a valid context to avoid timeouts or other exceptions."}
