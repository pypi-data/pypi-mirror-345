{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0), which is extracting iron ore and transferring it to nearby structures.\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5), used for storing extracted resources.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -48.5), responsible for moving iron ore from the chests to the furnaces.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-12.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-10.0, -48.0), also smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storing the produced iron plates:\n  - Position (-6.5, -49.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n  - Position (-6.5, -48.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n  - Position (-7.5, -48.5) with 60 iron plates.\n  - Position (-5.5, -48.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n  - Position (-4.5, -48.5) with 62 iron plates.\n  - Position (-3.5, -48.5) is empty.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at various positions for transferring items between chests and furnaces:\n  - Position (-14.5, -47.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Position (-11.5, -46.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Position (-8.5, -47.5), waiting for space in destination.\n\n### Additional Storage\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-12.5, -51.5), newly placed for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure there is enough space to place an entity. If an entity already exists at the target position, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position.\n- Avoid attempting to place an entity when the inventory does not contain the required items.\n\n### Errors when Crafting Items\n- Ensure all necessary resources are available before attempting to craft items. If crafting fails due to missing resources, gather more resources before retrying.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts and Inserters\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to a Wooden Chest. Use an inserter to input items into the Wooden Chest.\n\n### Errors Due to Distance\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity if the target is too far away. The maximum allowable distance is 10 units."}
