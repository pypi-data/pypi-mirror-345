{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity group at position (x=52.5, y=49.0) and (x=52.5, y=54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric pole (position 52.5, 49.0) and Electric pole (position 52.5, 54.0) are intended to provide electricity to nearby structures.\n\n### Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) that extracts water from the sea for use in other processes.\n\n### Pipe group at position (x=5.5, y=5.5)\nConsists of:\n- A series of pipes that transport water from the offshore pump to various locations.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) that smelts copper ore into copper plates.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) that moves items between the furnace and storage.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 1.5) that stores iron plates.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 3.5) that stores iron plates.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 5.5) that is currently empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any entities or terrain obstacles (e.g., water). \n\n### Errors when attempting to access entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to access (e.g., steam engine) exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. If the entity is not found, check your placement or ensure it has been built.\n\n### Repeated errors in placing electric poles\n- The same errors regarding the inability to place electric poles at (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0) due to obstructions have occurred multiple times. Ensure to clear the area before attempting to place again.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
