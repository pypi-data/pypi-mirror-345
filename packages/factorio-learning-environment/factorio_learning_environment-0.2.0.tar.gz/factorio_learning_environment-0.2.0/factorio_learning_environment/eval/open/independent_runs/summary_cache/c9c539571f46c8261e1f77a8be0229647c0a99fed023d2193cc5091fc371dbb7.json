{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n  - Currently has fuel and is smelting.\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Inventory: Contains 1 unit of iron ore and 4 units of iron plate.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having it in the inventory will result in an error.\n- Verify that the target location is suitable for placing an entity. Avoid attempting to place entities where there are existing objects in the way.\n\n### Errors related to crafting and inventory management\n- Ensure you have sufficient resources in your inventory before crafting. For instance, attempting to craft a Stone Furnace without enough stone will cause an error.\n- Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid assertion errors related to insufficient resources, such as iron ore.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Confirm that the entity contains the items you wish to extract. Attempting to extract iron plates from a stone furnace that does not contain them will result in an error.\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has completed the smelting process before attempting to extract iron plates. Repeated attempts to extract iron plates prematurely will result in errors.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient fuel\n- Always ensure that the stone furnace is adequately fueled before initiating the smelting process. Lack of fuel will prevent the furnace from operating and producing the desired output."}
