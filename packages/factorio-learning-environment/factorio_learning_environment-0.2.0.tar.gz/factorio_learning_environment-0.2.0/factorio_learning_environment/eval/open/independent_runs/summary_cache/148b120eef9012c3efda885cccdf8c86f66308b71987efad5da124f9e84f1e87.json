Verify and use the correct working PipeGroup's fluid_system ID (currently 20060) to supply water.\n   - Previous connection attempts with fluid_system IDs [19372, 19415, 19458, 19501, 19544, 19587, 19630, 19673] also failed. Consistently cross-check active PipeGroup data before initiating connections.\n   \n\u2022 Pipeline Stabilization Efficiency:\n   - Reliance on a fixed 10-second delay for pipeline stabilization has repeatedly led to unsuccessful connection attempts. Incorporate dynamic checks for pipeline readiness before proceeding with each connection attempt."}
