This will allow me to effectively fuel the furnaces for smelting operations.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- **3 pieces of stone furnaces**\n- **10 pieces of coal** (available)\n- **5 pieces of stone**\n- **20 pieces of copper ore**\n- **6 pieces of iron ore** (remaining after processing)\n- **7 pieces of iron plates**\n- **15 pieces of copper cables**\n- **13 pieces of Iron Gear Wheels**\n- **1 Electronic Circuit**.\n\n### Furnace Status:\n1. **First Existing Furnace**:\n   - Holds **6 pieces of iron ore** and is currently **WORKING**.\n   \n2. **Second Existing Furnace**:\n   - Contains **3 pieces of coal**, status is **\"NO_INGREDIENTS,\"** with no current materials to smelt.\n   \n3. **Newly Placed Furnace**:\n   - Holds **1 piece of coal**, status is **\"NO_INGREDIENTS,\"** unable to operate effectively.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Distribute Coal**: I will distribute coal to the second existing furnace to enable it to start processing iron plates.\n2. **Insert Iron Ore**: If there is enough coal in the first furnace, I will also consider inserting more iron ore to maximize production.\n3. **Monitor Production**: After coal distribution, I will keep track of the production status of both furnaces.\n\n### Let's proceed to insert **3 pieces of coal** into the second existing furnace to enable it for smelting.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Get the second existing furnace entity again\nsecond_existing_furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, second_existing_furnace_position)\n\n# Insert 3 pieces of coal into the second existing furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, second_existing_furnace, quantity=3)\n\n# Check the updated inventory of the second existing furnace after inserting coal\nupdated_second_furnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(second_existing_furnace)\nprint(f\"Updated inventory of the second existing furnace after inserting coal: {updated_second_furnace_inventory}\")  # Check furnace contents\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after all actions: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states again.", "summary_range": "[1-330]"}
