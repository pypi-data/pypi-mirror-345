{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 25.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup connections:\n  - PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 22.5) with pipes at positions [(x=-9.5, y=22.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-8.5, y=22.5), (x=-7.5, y=22.5)]\n  - PipeGroup at position (-4.5, 23.5) with pipes at positions [(x=-4.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=23.5)]\n  - PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5) with pipes at position [(x=-6.5, y=20.5)]\n  - PipeGroup at position (-4.5, 20.5) with pipes at positions [(x=-4.5, y=20.5), (x=-4.5, y=21.5), (x=-5.5, y=21.5), (x=-5.5, y=22.5)]\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) for transferring materials\n- Small Electric Pole at position (17.5, -0.5) for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions before placing pipes. Adjust the placement if necessary to avoid errors like \"Cannot place pipe at x=-8.5 y=23.5.\"\n\n### Errors with Connection Status\n- Ensure all components (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are properly connected with pipes to allow fluid flow. Check for warnings like \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections.\"\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that all electric components, such as inserters, are connected to a power source. Check for warnings like \"not receiving electricity\" and \"inserter waiting for source items.\"\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Verify that all fluid systems are correctly connected and have the necessary input and output connections to function properly."}
