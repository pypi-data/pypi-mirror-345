{"content": "The attempt to retrieve available crafting recipes resulted in an error, specifically stating **\"Could not get recipe of express-inserter.\"** This suggests that there may be an issue with accessing certain prototypes or recipes in the Factorio REPL environment.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- The error indicates that the code attempted to access a recipe that is not available or improperly referenced in the current context.\n- This prevents me from checking what crafting options are available with the **15 iron plates** and other materials.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Simplify Recipe Retrieval**: Instead of trying to retrieve all recipes at once, I can focus on specific recipes that are known to use iron plates.\n2. **Manual Check**: I can manually check for specific items that can be crafted using iron plates, such as:\n   - Iron gear wheels\n   - Transport belts\n   - Various machinery or components.\n3. **Resource Gathering**: While troubleshooting the recipe access, I can also gather more iron ore or copper ore to prepare for future crafting.\n\nLet\u2019s manually check for specific recipes that utilize iron plates. \n\n```python\n# Check for specific recipes that use iron plates\niron_plate_recipes = ['iron-gear-wheel', 'transport-belt', 'iron-chest']\navailable_recipes = {recipe: get_prototype_recipe(recipe) for recipe in iron_plate_recipes if get_prototype_recipe(recipe) is not None}\nprint(f\"Available recipes using iron plates: {available_recipes.keys()}\")\n```", "summary_range": "[1-204]"}
