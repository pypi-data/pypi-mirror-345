{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler (position not specified, but indicated as a new position)\n- Offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position not specified)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter (position not specified) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position not specified) that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to assembling machine at position -21.5, 25.5\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to entity placement\n- Ensure that the new position for placing entities (like the boiler) is not obstructed by existing entities. Check surrounding entities before placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to power connection\n- Ensure that all power-consuming entities (like the steam engine and assembling machine) are connected to a power network to avoid warnings and operational issues."}
