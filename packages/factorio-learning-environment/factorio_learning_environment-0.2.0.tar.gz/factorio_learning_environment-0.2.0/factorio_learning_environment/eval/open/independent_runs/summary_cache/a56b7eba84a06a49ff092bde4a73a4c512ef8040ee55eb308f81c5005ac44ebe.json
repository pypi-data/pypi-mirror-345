{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\n- Small electric poles at various positions including (-11.5, 26.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 22.5), and others\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill at position(5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position(y1) to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure there are no obstructions in the path when attempting to connect pipes between entities. Check the area for any overlapping structures or entities that may block the connection.\n\n### Errors when using electric entities\n- Make sure that all electric entities are properly connected to the power network. Check the status of poles and ensure they are within range to provide power to connected entities.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may block placement."}
