{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5,24.5)\nA complete and operational power generation setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5,24.5)\n- Boiler at position(-7.0,24.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5,24.5)\n- Multiple electric poles connecting the system\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\nThe system is fully operational with the steam engine producing power\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position(0,0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at position(0,0) with coal fuel, currently idle\n- Stone furnace at position(2,0) with coal fuel, currently idle\nBoth furnaces have produced iron plates previously\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position(4,4)\n- Stone furnace at position(4,4) with coal fuel, currently idle but has produced copper plates previously\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab loaded with automation science packs, connected to power grid but currently not receiving power\n- Connected to the power network through electric poles\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Check for terrain compatibility when placing entities (avoid water tiles)\n- Verify there are no existing entities blocking placement location\n- When placing electric poles next to other entities, consider:\n  - Increasing spacing between entities\n  - Changing placement direction\n  - Adjusting reference position to avoid collisions with trees or other objects\n\n### Power System Connection Issues\n- Ensure proper sequence of power system components (pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine \u2192 electric poles \u2192 consumers)\n- Verify power connections are complete from power source to all consumers\n\n### Resource Gathering Requirements\n- Some items (like wood) cannot be crafted and must be gathered from the environment\n- Ensure raw resources are gathered before attempting to craft items that require them\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Position arguments must be proper Position objects, not raw coordinates\n- Building dimensions should be accessed through proper API methods, not direct attribute access\n\n### Recipe and Technology Requirements\n- Research required technologies before attempting to craft items\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft complex items"}
