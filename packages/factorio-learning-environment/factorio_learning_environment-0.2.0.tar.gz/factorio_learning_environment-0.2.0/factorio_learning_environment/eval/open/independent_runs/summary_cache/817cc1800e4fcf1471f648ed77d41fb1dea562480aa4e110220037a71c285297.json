{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Ore Mining at position(-17.0, -50.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position (-17.0, -50.0)) \n-  Burner mining drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) \n-  Transport belt group (position (-17.5, -51.5) to (-12.5, -51.5)) that connects the mining drills\n\n### Iron Plate Production at position(-10.0, -49.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Furnace (position (-10.0, -49.0)) \n-  Burner inserter (position (-13.5, -50.5)) that puts iron ore into the furnace\n-  Burner inserter (position (-13.5, -48.5)) that takes iron plate from the furnace\n-  Transport belt group (position (-12.5, -46.5) to (-12.5, -49.5)) that connects the inserter and the furnace\n\n### Storage at position(-16.5, -47.5)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Wooden chest (position (-16.5, -47.5)) \n-  Burner inserter (position (-16.5, -46.5)) that puts items into the chest\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using inserter but having no source items\n-  Make sure to have source items before using an inserter to put items into another entity\n### Errors when mining but having no fuel\n-  Make sure to have fuel in the burner mining drill before mining\n### Errors when smelting but having no ingredients\n-  Make sure to have ingredients in the furnace before smelting\n### Errors when placing items but having no space\n-  Make sure to have space in the entity before putting items into it\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   `insert_item`: a function that inserts an item into an entity. It has been invoked with `Prototype.IronOre` as the item to insert, but failed due to lack of a nearby entity that can accept iron ore.\n*   Important variables:\n    *   `inserter1`: an inserter entity\n    *   `burner-mining-drill`: a burner mining drill entity\n    *   `stone-furnace`: a stone furnace entity\n    *   `iron-ore`: the item being mined\n    *   `iron-plate`: the item being produced\n    *   `coal`: the fuel being used by the burner mining drill and inserter"}
