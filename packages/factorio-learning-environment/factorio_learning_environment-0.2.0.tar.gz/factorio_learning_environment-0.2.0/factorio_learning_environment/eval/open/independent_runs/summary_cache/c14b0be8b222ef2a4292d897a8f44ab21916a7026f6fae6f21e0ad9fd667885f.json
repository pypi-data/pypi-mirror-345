{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5) connected to lab at position (6.5, 6.5).\n- Connected existing pole at position (1.5, 1.5) to lab at position (6.5, 6.5).\n\n### Lab at position(6.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (6.5, 6.5) which requires 10 automation science packs to complete automation research but is currently not powered.\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 18) and status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Furnace at position(2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (2.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 7) and status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power connection\n- Ensure that all electric poles are properly connected to the electric network. The pole at position (2.5, 2.5) is currently not plugged into the electric network.\n  \n### Errors when using the API\n- Review the API usage for building boxes. The error messages indicate a potential issue with the building box dimensions for the small electric pole. Verify that the dimensions are correctly defined.\n\n### Errors when connecting poles\n- When connecting electric poles, ensure they are within range of the entities they are meant to power. The lab at position (6.5, 6.5) is still not powered despite connections being made.\n\n### General tips\n- Regularly check the status of entities to ensure they are functioning as intended and troubleshoot any issues promptly."}
