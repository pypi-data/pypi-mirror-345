Repeated efforts to establish a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs have not resulted in a constructed facility\u2014the lab placement and crafting attempts failed due to inventory shortages and unmet ingredient requirements. Although retrieval calls identified furnaces (an alternative furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) for smelting purposes, these were not built by the agent; rather, they were referenced from pre\u2010existing assets and did not result in any newly created production structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Issues with get_entities  \n\u2003\u2013 Use the function\u2019s exact signature.
