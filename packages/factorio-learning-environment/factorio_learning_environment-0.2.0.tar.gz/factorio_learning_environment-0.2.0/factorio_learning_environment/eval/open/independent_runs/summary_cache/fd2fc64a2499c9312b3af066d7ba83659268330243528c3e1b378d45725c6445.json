{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore and transferring it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to a furnace, but currently misaligned.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to pick up items from the chest and drop them into the furnace. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials, causing production delays.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel inserters and mining drills to maintain continuous operation. An inserter out of fuel cannot transfer items, leading to process bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors in Resource Flow\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting. Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and operational to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace."}
