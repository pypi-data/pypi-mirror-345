{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', status: NOT_CONNECTED.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with warning 'out of fuel', status: NO_FUEL.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), status: WORKING.\n- **Pipe Network** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, consisting of multiple pipe segments at various positions to facilitate water flow.\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- **PipeGroup (fluid_system=20955)** at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), status: EMPTY.\n- **PipeGroup (fluid_system=20961)** at position (x=-0.5, y=21.5), status: EMPTY.\n- **PipeGroup (fluid_system=20962)** at position (x=2.5, y=21.5), status: EMPTY.\n- **PipeGroup (fluid_system=20966)** at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status: FULL_OUTPUT, carrying water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup (id=39293)** with poles at various positions, providing infrastructure for electrical connections.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of fluid. Check pipe connections and ensure there are no gaps or misalignments.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in boilers and ensure they are refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**: None assigned."}
