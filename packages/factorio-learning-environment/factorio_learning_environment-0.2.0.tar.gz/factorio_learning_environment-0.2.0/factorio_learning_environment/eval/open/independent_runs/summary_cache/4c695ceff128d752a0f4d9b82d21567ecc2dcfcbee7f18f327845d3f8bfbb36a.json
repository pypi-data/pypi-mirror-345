{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0): This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore. It is currently fueled with coal and has a warning indicating that its output is blocked by an item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but currently has a warning indicating \"no ingredients to smelt,\" meaning it lacks the necessary input materials.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-22.5, -51.5): This chest is used for storing items. It is currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest at the desired location**: Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placing a wooden chest.\n- **Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location**: Verify that the intended placement area is clear and that the inserter can be placed without obstruction.\n- **Cannot place Transport Belt at the desired location**: Check that the target tile is unoccupied and that there is a clear path for the transport belt.\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory and Resources\n- **Could not place burner-mining-drill at (-21.0, -52.0), No burner_mining_drill in inventory**: Ensure that the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Output Blockage and Production Issues\n- **Burner Mining Drill output blocked by item on the ground**: Make sure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to receive the output from the drill.\n- **Furnace not producing iron plates**: Check the setup to ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients, such as iron ore, to produce iron plates."}
