{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), fueled by coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-13.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -47.5), responsible for transferring resources between entities.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0), used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at various positions for storing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors When Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity has the items available for extraction before attempting to extract. Verify the inventory of the entity to confirm the presence of the desired items.\n\n#### Inserter Blockage Errors\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not blocked before attempting to transfer items. Regularly check and clear any blockages to maintain smooth operations.\n\n#### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Before initiating a smelting process, confirm that the furnace has the required ingredients. Regularly supply the furnace with necessary resources to avoid interruptions.\n\n#### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n#### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
