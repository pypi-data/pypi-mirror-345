{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Setup (around x=41, y=-82)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Connected to wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for coal collection\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for additional coal storage\n\n### Coal Transport System (around x=43, y=-80)\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5) moving coal from chest to transport belt\n- Belt system consisting of:\n  - First belt at (42.5, -79.5)\n  - Second belt at (43.5, -79.5)\n  - Third belt at (43.5, -80.5)\n  - Fourth belt at (43.5, -81.5)\n- Burner inserter at (43.5, -82.5) moving coal to furnace\n\n### Smelting Setup (around x=45, y=-81)\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n- When placing transport belts or inserters, ensure the target location is clear of other entities\n- Check for entity collisions before placement - multiple attempts were made to place entities in occupied spaces\n- Verify the correct positioning of inserters relative to belts and other entities before placement\n- When connecting structures with belts, plan the layout to avoid overlapping with existing structures\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill\n- `coal_chest`: Chest\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `transport_belts`: List[TransportBelt]\n\n### Entity States\n- Mining drill: Working state with coal fuel\n- Chest inserter: Alternating between waiting for source items and waiting for space\n- Furnace inserter: Waiting for source items\n- Furnaces: No ingredients state with full coal fuel"}
