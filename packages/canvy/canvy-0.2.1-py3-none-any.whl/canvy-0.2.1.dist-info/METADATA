  The urn example in the "W2.1-MLE.pdf" file is a classic     
                                                              
  Here's the essence of the urn example:

  - The proportion of red balls in the urn is unknown, ...

  The example demonstrates how MLE uses observed data to i    
  simple and concrete scenario. If you want, I can provide
