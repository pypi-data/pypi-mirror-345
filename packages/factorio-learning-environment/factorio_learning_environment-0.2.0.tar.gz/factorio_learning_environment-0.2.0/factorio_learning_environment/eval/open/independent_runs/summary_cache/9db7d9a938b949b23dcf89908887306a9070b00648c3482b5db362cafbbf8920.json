{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump connected via pipes to a boiler.\n- Boiler at position (-12.5, 21.5) with no input liquid or fluid present in connections.\n- Multiple electric poles placed at positions such as (-13.5, 24.5) and (-2.5, 25.0) intended to connect to a steam engine, which is not present.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) and another at (16.5, 0.5), both not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5) with status empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (0.5, 16.5) with status empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 21.5) with status empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5) with status empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (-4.5, 23.5) with status empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions such as (16.5, 8.5), (7.5, 10.5), and (15.5, 2.5) with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure the steam engine is placed at the correct position and connected to the power network. The current setup indicates a missing steam engine at positions like (-0.5, 25.0) and (-3.5, 25.0).\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Status\n- Verify that the boiler and steam engine are correctly connected to the offshore pump and have the necessary input liquid. This will resolve warnings about no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Errors with Electric Poles\n- Confirm that electric poles are correctly positioned to connect all necessary components to the power network. This will help in resolving the 'not connected to power network' issue.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a powered electricity network. Check the connections and power status of electric poles to resolve 'not receiving electricity' warnings."}
