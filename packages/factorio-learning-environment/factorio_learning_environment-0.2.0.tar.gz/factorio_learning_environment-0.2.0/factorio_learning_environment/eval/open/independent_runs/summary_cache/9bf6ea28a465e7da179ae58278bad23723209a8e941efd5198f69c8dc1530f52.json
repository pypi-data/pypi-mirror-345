{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel and status WORKING, extracting iron ore from the environment.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that serves as a drop-off point for the iron ore extracted by the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore with a current inventory of 382 iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently not processing any ingredients, indicated by its status NO_INGREDIENTS.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting iron ore from inventory**: \n  - Ensure you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into any entity. The error indicates that the agent attempted to insert iron ore without having any in its inventory.\n  \n- **Errors when the wooden chest is full**: \n  - The Burner Mining Drill is unable to continue mining because the chest at the drop position is full. Regularly empty the chest to allow continuous operation of the mining drill.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace has no ingredients**: \n  - The Stone Furnace is currently not smelting because it lacks ingredients. Ensure to provide the necessary raw materials for smelting to avoid this issue.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wood`: str\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `drill_status`: EntityStatus\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus"}
