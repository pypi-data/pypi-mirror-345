{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) [Status: NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) [Status: NO_FUEL]\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) [Status: WORKING]\n- Pipe Group at positions (-4.5, 16.5) [Status: EMPTY] and (-9.5, 23.5) [Status: FULL_OUTPUT]\n- Electricity Group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715) [Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK]\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) [Status: NO_INGREDIENTS]\n\n### Electric Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles placed at positions:\n  - (-3.5, 18.5)\n  - (1.5, 20.5)\n  - (-1.5, 19.5)\n  - (-1.5, 21.5)\n  - (0.5, 18.5)\n  - (0.5, 20.5)\n  - (0.5, 23.5)\n- Connected to form a network spanning from (-3.5, 18.5) to (0.5, 23.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting and Inventory Management\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, copper plates are needed to craft copper cables, which are required for small electric poles.\n- Regularly check and update your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for crafting and placing structures.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Structures\n- Verify pipe connections between entities like the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Ensure that pipes are properly connected to allow fluid flow.\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity network are properly connected to avoid issues with power distribution.\n\n### Errors in Placement and Connection of Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have sufficient small electric poles in your inventory before attempting to place or connect them.\n- Verify that electric poles are properly connected to form a continuous network to supply power to all necessary structures.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Avoid attempting to place entities in occupied tiles or where there is no valid connection path.\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly positioned and connected to function as intended."}
