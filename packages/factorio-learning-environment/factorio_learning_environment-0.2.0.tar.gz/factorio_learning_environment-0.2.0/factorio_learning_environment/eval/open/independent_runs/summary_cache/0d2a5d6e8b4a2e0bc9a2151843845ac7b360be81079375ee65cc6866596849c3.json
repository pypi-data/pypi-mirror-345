{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns correctly with the chest. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from picking up items. Double-check the positions before placing the inserter.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Placement\n- When placing an inserter, ensure there is no collision with existing entities or unsuitable terrain. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors in Refueling\n- Always verify that you have sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Running out of fuel will halt operations.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to function. Check the inserter setup to confirm that it is correctly transferring items to the furnace."}
