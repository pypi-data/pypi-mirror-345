{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) which is currently fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Storage Facility at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, before placing a stone furnace, make sure it exists in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without having the required raw resources\n- Before attempting to craft an item, ensure you have all the necessary raw resources. For example, to craft a wooden chest, you need wood, which must be gathered as it is a raw resource and not craftable.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when crafting items that require intermediate products\n- When crafting complex items, ensure you have all the necessary intermediate products. For instance, crafting an inserter requires electronic circuits, which in turn require copper cables and copper plates. Copper plates need to be smelted in a furnace. Ensure you have the necessary infrastructure and resources to produce these intermediate products before crafting the final item."}
