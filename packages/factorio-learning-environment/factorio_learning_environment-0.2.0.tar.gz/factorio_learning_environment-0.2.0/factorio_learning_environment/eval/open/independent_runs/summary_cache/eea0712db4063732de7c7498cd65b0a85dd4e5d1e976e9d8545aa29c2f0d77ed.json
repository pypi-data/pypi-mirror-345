A 'Chest' object is not callable, so use the appropriate function to remove it.\n\n### Errors when inspecting belts\n- Verify that the transport belt contains the expected items before attempting to extract them. Ensure the belt is correctly set up and operational.\n\n### Inventory Full Errors\n- Regularly check inventory space and manage it to prevent it from becoming full. Move excess items to storage chests to free up space.\n\n### Errors when moving items to a full chest\n- Before attempting to insert items into a chest, ensure there is enough space available. Consider using additional storage or consolidating items to prevent overflow.\n\n### NameError in code\n- Double-check the spelling and case of entity names in code. Ensure that the correct class or variable name is being referenced, such as 'BurnerInserter' instead of a misspelled variant."}
