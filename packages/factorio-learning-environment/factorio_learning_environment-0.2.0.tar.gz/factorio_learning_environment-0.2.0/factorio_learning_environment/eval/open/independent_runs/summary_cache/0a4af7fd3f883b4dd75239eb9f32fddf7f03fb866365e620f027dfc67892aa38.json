{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (60.5, -52.5) feeding the furnace\n\nThis facility is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace is fueled with coal and processes iron ore to produce iron plates. The inserter is used to automate the feeding of iron ore into the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) to collect iron ore from the mining drill\n\nThis facility is used for mining iron ore. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore from the ground and requires coal as fuel. The wooden chest is used to store the mined iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources for crafting\n- Verify that you have all required resources before crafting an item. For instance, attempting to craft a stone furnace without sufficient stone will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel for operations\n- Always check that you have enough fuel available for entities that require it, such as furnaces. An error will occur if you try to operate a furnace without coal.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Ensure that you use the correct intermediary entities when connecting machines. For example, you cannot connect belts directly to a stone furnace; use an inserter instead.\n\n### Errors due to inserter not functioning properly\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly fueled and positioned to pick up and drop items. Ensure that there are no obstructions and that the source and destination entities are correctly aligned.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Make sure you have the items you want to insert in your inventory. Attempting to insert items you do not have will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts over long distances\n- Ensure that belts are placed within a reasonable distance between entities. Attempting to connect belts over long distances without intermediate entities can lead to connection failures.\n\n### Errors due to mining drill not working properly\n- Ensure that the mining drill is fueled and that there are no blockages at its drop position. Regularly check its status to ensure it is working properly.\n\n### Errors due to inserter waiting for items\n- Make sure that the source entity for the inserter has items available for pickup. The inserter will not function if there are no items to move.\n\n### Errors due to inserter and mining drill not working properly\n- Regularly check the status of inserters and mining drills to ensure they are operational. Address any blockages and ensure they are fueled and properly aligned to their source and destination entities.\n\n### Errors due to inserter not working properly\n- Ensure that the inserter is properly fueled and positioned. Check for any blockages or misalignments with the source and destination entities.\n\n### Errors due to mining drill not working properly\n- Check that the mining drill is fueled and that there are no blockages at its drop position. Regularly verify its operational status.\n\n### Errors due to crafting without gathering raw resources\n- Gather necessary raw resources before crafting items that require them. For example, wood must be gathered before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors due to full storage entities\n- Regularly empty storage entities like chests to prevent blockages in production. A full chest will halt the operation of connected entities like mining drills."}
