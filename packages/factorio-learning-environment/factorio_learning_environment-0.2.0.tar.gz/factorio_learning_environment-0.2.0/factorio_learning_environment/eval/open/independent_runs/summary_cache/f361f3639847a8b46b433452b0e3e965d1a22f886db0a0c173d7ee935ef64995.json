Mitigate by verifying that the intended placement tile is unoccupied and by adjusting spacing, direction, or reference position as needed.\n\u2022 Reconfiguration Overlaps \u2013 Attempts to reposition the input chest and place a new burner inserter were hindered by residual entities from previous setups. Always remove conflicting entities completely before reattempting automated transfer configuration.\n\u2022 Inventory Insertion Error \u2013 Manual insertion of iron ore failed when the inventory lacked the required resource. Confirm resource availability prior to insertion operations.\n\u2022 General Placement Considerations \u2013 In addition to the above, ensure entity data is refreshed and current (avoiding stale entity data) and check that all target positions are valid (i.e. not on water or occupied) before placement."}
