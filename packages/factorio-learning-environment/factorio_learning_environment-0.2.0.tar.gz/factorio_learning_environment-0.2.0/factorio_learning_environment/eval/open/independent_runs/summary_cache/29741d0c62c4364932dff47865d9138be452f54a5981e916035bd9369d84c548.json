{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) (working, connected to pipe network)\n- Boiler at (-6.0, 1.5) (working, contains coal)\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 4.5) (now WORKING, connected to pipe network)\n- Pipe network connecting all components (fluid system 1398 for water, 1399 for steam)\n\n### Iron Production Facility at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) (now WORKING, extracting iron ore)\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 72.5) containing 91 iron ore\n- Inserter at (16.5, 72.5) (WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION)\n- Stone furnace at (18.0, 73.0) (status: WORKING, producing iron plates)\n- Assembling machine 2 at (20.5, 73.5) (status: NO_POWER)\n- Input inserter at (19.5, 73.5) (WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS)\n- Small electric poles throughout the area (now powered, voltage: 404506)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent power connection issues (improved but still present)\n- Assembling machine remains without power despite network improvements\n- Verify all power pole connections reach all production buildings\n\n### Entity placement distance errors (recurring)\n- Attempted to place inserter from 75 tiles away (move within 10 tiles first)\n- Boiler placement failed due to distance/terrain (verify position is land and accessible)\n\n### Pipe connection failures (new)\n- Multiple pipe connection attempts failed between boiler and steam engine\n- Verify pipe path is clear and connection points are unobstructed\n- Check fluid directionality when connecting pipes\n\n### Entity collision errors (recurring)\n- Attempted to place pipe where one already exists (remove existing first)\n- Boiler placement blocked by terrain/water (scan area before placement)\n\n### Belt connection issues (new)\n- Failed to connect transport belts due to invalid path length\n- Verify belt endpoints align properly before connection attempts\n\n### Entity access errors (new)\n- Attempted to access non-existent furnace (verify entity exists before operations)\n- When rebuilding structures, confirm old entities are removed first\n\n### Inserter operation issues (persistent)\n- Output inserter still blocked (clear output area)\n- Input inserter waiting for items (verify source inventory and belt connections)\n\n### Fluid system warnings\n- Steam engine now operational but monitor fluid levels\n- Maintain coal supply to boiler to prevent steam production interruptions"}
