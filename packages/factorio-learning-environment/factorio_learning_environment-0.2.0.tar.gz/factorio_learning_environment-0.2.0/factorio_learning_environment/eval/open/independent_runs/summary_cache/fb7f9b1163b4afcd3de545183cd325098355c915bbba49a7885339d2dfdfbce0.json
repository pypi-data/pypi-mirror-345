{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report: Steps 0-15\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Setup (Water -> Steam -> Potential Power)\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) extracts water.\n*   **Boiler** at position (x=-2.0, y=4.5) heats water using coal. Currently has `EntityStatus.NO_FUEL`.\n*   **Steam Engine** at position (x=2.5, y=4.5) ready to consume steam. Currently `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED` and has no fluid.\n*   **Pipe Network 1** (Fluid: water) connects the Offshore Pump to the Boiler. Consists of multiple pipes including segments near (x=-8.5, y=-0.5) and (x=-2.5, y=2.5). Status: `EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT`.\n*   **Pipe Network 2** (Fluid: steam) connects the Boiler output to the Steam Engine input. Consists of multiple pipes including segments near (x=-0.5, y=4.5) and (x=0.5, y=2.5). Status: `EntityStatus.EMPTY`.\n*   **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=6.5) is intended to fuel the Boiler from a belt at (x=-1.5, y=7.5). Currently `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`.\n\n### Automated Coal Mining and Delivery\n*   **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) mines coal. Status: `EntityStatus.WORKING`.\n*   **Wooden Chest** at position (x=16.5, y=1.5) receives coal from the drill.\n*   **Burner Inserter** at position (x=17.5, y=2.5) moves coal from the chest to a transport belt. Status: `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`.\n*   **Transport Belt** starting at (x=16.5, y=2.5) intended to move coal towards the boiler.\n*   **Belt Groups:** Several belt groups exist, attempting to connect the coal mine output to the boiler fuel inserter pickup point at (x=-1.5, y=7.5). These connections seem incomplete or problematic based on errors. The final group ends at (x=-1.5, y=7.5) but is `EntityStatus.EMPTY`.\n\n### Basic Iron Ore Mining Setup (Attempted)\n*   **Electric Mining Drill** at position (x=18.5, y=73.5) placed over iron ore. Status: `EntityStatus.NO_POWER`.\n*   **Stone Furnace** at position (x=19.0, y=76.0) intended for smelting. Status: `EntityStatus.NO_FUEL`.\n*   **Burner Inserter** (Fuel) placed at (x=17.5, y=76.5)"}
