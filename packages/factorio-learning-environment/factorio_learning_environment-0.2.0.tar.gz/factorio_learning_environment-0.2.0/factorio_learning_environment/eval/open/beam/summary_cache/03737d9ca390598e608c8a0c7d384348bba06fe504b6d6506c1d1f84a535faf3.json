{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has yielded the following results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace currently holds **3 pieces of stone** after the attempted insertion of **5 pieces**. This indicates that the furnace is still not recognizing the full amount of input.\n- The furnace is marked as **\"WORKING,\"** suggesting it is powered, but it is not processing any materials, as indicated by the empty furnace result.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore available.**\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates available.**\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace consistently recognizes only **3 pieces of stone** instead of the total **5**. This ongoing issue continues to hinder its operational capacity to smelt the Copper Ore.\n- The furnace has **6 pieces of coal** as fuel, confirming that it is powered but still failing to process the input correctly.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Remaining Stone**: I will extract the **3 pieces of stone** currently in the furnace to clear its inputs.\n2. **Retry Loading**: After clearing the furnace, I will attempt to load **2 pieces of stone** back into it along with the **1 piece of Copper Ore**.\n3. **Monitor for Successful Smelting Operation**: I will check if the furnace can now properly process the Copper Ore.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the remaining stone from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the remaining stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, furnace_status, quantity=3)  # Extract the 3 pieces of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(furnace_status)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\n\n# Since the extraction is successful, let's confirm the furnace is empty.\n# If empty, proceed to load 5 pieces of stone and 1 piece of Copper Ore again.\nif overall_inventory_after_extraction[Prototype.Stone] == 0:  \n    insert_item(Prototype.Stone, furnace_status, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 pieces of stone into the active furnace\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace_status, quantity=1)  # Insert copper ore for processing\n\n# Check overall furnace inventory and player inventory again to see if they were updated accordingly\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_reinsertion = inspect_inventory(furnace_status)  # Check the furnace status after insertion attempt\noverall_inventory_after_reinsertion = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone and copper ore.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after re-insertion attempt: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_reinsertion}\")  # Output current furnace status after attempt\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after re-insertion attempt: {overall_inventory_after_reinsertion}\")  # Output total inventory after attempt \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-446]"}
