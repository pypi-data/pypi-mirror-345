# trie

A type of [tree](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/tree/tree.md) data structure that is used to store a dynamic [set](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/foundamental/set.md) of strings, where the keys are usually strings. Each [node](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/node.md) in the trie represents a single character of a [string](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/collection/string/string.md), and the path from the root to a node represents a prefix of the string. The main advantage of using a trie is that it allows for efficient retrieval of strings with common prefixes.
