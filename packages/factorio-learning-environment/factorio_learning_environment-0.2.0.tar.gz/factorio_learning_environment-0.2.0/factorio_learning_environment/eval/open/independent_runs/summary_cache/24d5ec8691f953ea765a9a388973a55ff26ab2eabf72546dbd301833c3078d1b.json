{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (-39.5, -116.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with a copper plate output\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with an iron plate output\n\n### Additional Furnace Setup\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (-47.5, -122.5) with water\n- Multiple empty PipeGroups at various positions indicating potential future expansions or connections\n\n### Electrical Network\n- Electricity Group with poles spanning multiple positions, providing potential power distribution\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently without power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Connection Errors\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to the water source. Verify the alignment and connectivity of pipes between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure water flow.\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Errors\n- Confirm that the steam engine is connected to the power network and receiving input liquid. Check the connectivity of pipes and ensure the steam engine is properly aligned with the boiler output.\n\n### Inserter Power Errors\n- Make sure inserters are within the range of powered electric poles. Extend the electrical network if necessary to supply power to all inserters.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Errors\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply lines or manually provide the required resources to avoid production halts."}
