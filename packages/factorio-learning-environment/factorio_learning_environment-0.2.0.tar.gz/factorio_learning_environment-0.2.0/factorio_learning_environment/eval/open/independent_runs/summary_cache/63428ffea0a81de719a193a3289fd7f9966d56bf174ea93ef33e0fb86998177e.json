{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Burner Inserter Placement**: Ensure that the target location is clear and suitable for placing a Burner Inserter. The agent encountered multiple errors when trying to place a Burner Inserter at an unsuitable location.\n- **Wooden Chest Placement**: Verify that the drill's drop position is unoccupied before attempting to place a Wooden Chest. The agent faced issues when trying to place a Wooden Chest at a blocked drop position.\n- **Transport Belt Placement**: Confirm that the desired location is available and appropriate for placing a Transport Belt to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors related to entity retrieval\n- **Stone Furnace Retrieval**: Ensure that the specified position contains the correct entity type before attempting to retrieve it. The agent encountered errors when trying to get a Stone Furnace at positions where no such entity existed.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Output Management**: Address warnings related to blocked outputs by ensuring there is a sink entity to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill.\n- **Resource Management**: Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills to maintain continuous operation."}
