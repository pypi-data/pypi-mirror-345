Recent execution steps attempted reconfigurations using WP1 = (\u20114.0, 10.5), WP1 = (21.5, 26.0), WP1 = (20.5, 26.0) and a three\u2010segment route with WP1 = (\u20114.0, 20.0) and WP2 = (20.5, 20.0). None of these attempts have resulted in successful belt placement.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Belt Connection Path and Alignment Errors:\n  - Ensure intermediate waypoints are strictly grid-aligned and form a monotonic, axis\u2010aligned path. Multiple attempts using waypoints such as (\u20114.0, 10.5), (21.5, 26.0), (20.5, 26.0), (\u20114.0, 20.0) and (20.5, 20.0) failed normalization due to invalid path configurations.\n\n\u2022 Placement Blockage Errors:\n  - Verify that target areas for belt segment connections are unobstructed. Connection failures to burner\u2010inserters have occurred because of placement blockages.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Sub-Ingredient Shortages:\n  - Confirm sufficient availability of required sub\u2010ingredients (e.g. iron plates) before initiating the crafting of transport belts and gear wheels. Ensure furnaces and related crafting machines are operational to prevent crafting failures.\n\n\u2022 Manual Belt Placement Failures:\n  - Review manual placement routines when forced belt placement yields no new belt segments. Check inventory deductions and bypass mechanisms to ensure manual placement succeeds.\n\n\u2022 General API and Placement Verification:\n  - Consistently perform existence and occupancy checks along with validating API parameters to avoid persistent errors in connection, crafting, and manual placement operations."}
