{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Additional Transport Belts extending to various positions for ore movement.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Additional Transport Belts extending to various positions for ore movement.\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Storage at Position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position if a transport-belt already exists at the new position.\n\n### Errors connecting belts\n- Check the connectivity of belts to ensure they are properly linked. Avoid attempting to connect belts to entities that do not support outputs, such as chests.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have items available to be picked up. This may involve checking the production chain to ensure resources are being delivered to the inserters."}
