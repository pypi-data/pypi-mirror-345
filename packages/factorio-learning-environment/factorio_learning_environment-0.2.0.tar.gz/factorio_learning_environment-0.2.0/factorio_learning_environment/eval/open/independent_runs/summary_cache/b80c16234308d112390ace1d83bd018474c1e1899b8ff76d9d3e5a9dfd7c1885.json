{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (x=-16.0, y=-49.0)**: Fueled by coal, currently has a full output of iron plates and is awaiting emptying.\n- **Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)**: Fueled by coal, actively working with iron ore being supplied.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5)**: Supplies iron ore to the furnace at (x=-14.0, y=-49.0).\n- **Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5)**: Stores iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5)**: Waiting for source items, connected to the transport belt system.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5)**: Waiting for source items, part of the transport belt system.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5)**: Actively working, part of the transport belt system.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5)**: Stores iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5)**: Currently empty.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **BeltGroup**: Connects various parts of the facility, facilitating the movement of materials.\n  - Inputs from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5), outputs from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5).\n  - Inputs from (x=-12.5, y=-44.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-46.5), outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-46.5).\n- **Individual Belts**: Positioned at various coordinates to facilitate movement of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply it to furnaces or chests. Regularly check inventory levels and resupply as necessary.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Keep track of the supply chain to ensure that inserters have access to the required source items. Adjust the transport belt system or inventory levels to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors with Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and empty the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Consider using inserters and chests to automate the removal of finished goods."}
