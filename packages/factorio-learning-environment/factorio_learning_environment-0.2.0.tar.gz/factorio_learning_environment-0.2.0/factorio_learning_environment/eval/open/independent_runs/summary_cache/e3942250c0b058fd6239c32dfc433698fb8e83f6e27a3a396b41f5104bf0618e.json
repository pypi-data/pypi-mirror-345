{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Expanded Power System at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Output connection point at (-9.0, -0.5)\n  - Currently not connected to any pipes\n- **Boiler cluster** (3 units)\n  - Boiler at (-8.0, 0.5) facing RIGHT\n    - Input connection points at (-8.5, -1.5) and (-8.5, 2.5)\n    - Steam output at (-6.5, 0.5)\n  - Boiler at (-7.0, 1.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Boiler at (-8.0, 2.5) facing RIGHT\n- **Steam engine** at (-2.5, 0.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Still not connected to any boiler outputs\n\n### Fluid Infrastructure\n- **Underground pipe segment** at (-8.5, -0.5)\n  - Currently isolated, not connected to pump or boilers\n- **Vertical pipe segment** at (-8.5, 0.5)\n  - Not connected to any other components\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Fluid Connection Issues\n- Repeated pipe placement failures at (-9.0, -0.5) and (-8.5, -0.5)\n  - Clear existing entities before pipe placement attempts\n  - Verify exact connection points for offshore pumps (must match output direction)\n  - Use underground pipes with proper spacing (minimum 4 tiles between ends)\n\n### Boiler Connection Problems\n- Multiple failed attempts to connect boilers to water supply\n  - Boiler input must be on opposite side from steam output\n  - Ensure pipe connections align with boiler's input points\n  - Verify minimum distance requirements between components\n\n### Placement Collision Errors\n- Continued placement failures due to existing entities\n  - Implement systematic position scanning before placement\n  - Maintain minimum 1-tile spacing between all components\n  - Verify underground pipe exit positions are clear before placement\n\n### New Connection Routing Issues\n- Failed direct pipe connections between (-9.0, -0.5) and boilers\n  - Use underground pipes for crossing obstacles\n  - Verify underground pipe directionality matches connection points\n  - Check minimum distance requirements for underground pipes\n\n### System Validation Improvements\n- Multiple connection validation failures\n  - Verify source and target entities are different before connecting\n  - Check connection point directions match\n  - Implement pre-connection validation checks\n\n### Offshore Pump Specific Issues\n- Repeated pump output connection failures\n  - Offshore pump output is fixed at (-9.0, -0.5) when facing RIGHT\n  - Must connect directly to this position first before routing to boilers\n  - Cannot connect to pump from arbitrary positions"}
