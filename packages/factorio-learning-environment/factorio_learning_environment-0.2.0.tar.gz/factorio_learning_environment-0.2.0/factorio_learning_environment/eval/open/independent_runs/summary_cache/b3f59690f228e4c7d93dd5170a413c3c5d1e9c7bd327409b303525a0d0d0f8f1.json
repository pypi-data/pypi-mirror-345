{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe at position (-47.5, -122.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Multiple PipeGroups connecting these entities, ensuring fluid flow from the offshore pump to the steam engine.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore into plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Handling\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) and another at position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items between entities.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles distributed across the map, providing power to various entities, though some are not receiving electricity due to connectivity issues.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear of other entities before placing a new entity. If an entity already exists, remove it before proceeding.\n\n### Errors Due to Misplaced Pipes\n- Verify that there is no obstruction at the intended placement position of pipes. Clear any obstructions before attempting to place pipes.\n\n### Connectivity Issues in Power Network\n- Check connections between electric poles and ensure all entities requiring power are connected to the network. Address any warnings related to power connectivity to ensure efficient operation."}
