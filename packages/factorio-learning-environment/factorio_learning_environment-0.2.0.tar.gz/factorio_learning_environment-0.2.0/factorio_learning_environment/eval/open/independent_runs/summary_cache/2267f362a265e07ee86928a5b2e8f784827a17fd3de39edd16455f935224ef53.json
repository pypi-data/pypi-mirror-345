The error indicates that the inventory is full, which prevents the insertion of iron plates.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that the lab and other structures requiring power are connected to a power source to avoid status updates indicating NO_POWER.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
