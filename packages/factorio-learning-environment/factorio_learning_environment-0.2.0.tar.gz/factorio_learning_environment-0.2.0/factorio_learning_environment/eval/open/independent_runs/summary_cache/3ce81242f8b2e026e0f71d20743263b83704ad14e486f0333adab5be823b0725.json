{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -48.0): Smelts the iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5): Transfers iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n### Secondary Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nThis furnace is currently inactive due to a lack of ingredients. It consists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended for smelting but currently has no ingredients to process.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Misalignment and Collision Issues**: Ensure that the placement of entities like inserters does not overlap with existing entities. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions. For example, attempts to place a burner inserter at positions (-15.0, -50.0) and (-14.5, -48.5) failed due to existing entities.\n  \n### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- **Insufficient Resources**: Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required resources are available in the inventory. An error occurred when trying to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- **Misalignment of Inserters**: Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the entities they are interacting with. Misalignment was detected at position (-10.5, -48.5), which required repositioning the inserter to (-12.5, -48.5).\n\n### Warnings in Entity Status\n- **Output Blockage**: Ensure that there is a sink entity to accept the output from a mining drill to prevent blockage. The burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) has a warning about output being blocked by an item on the ground."}
