{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Small electric poles (positions x=3.5, y=6.5; x=4.5, y=6.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the components\n\nThe power generation system is currently not functioning properly. The boiler is out of fuel and the steam engine is not connected to the power network. There are also issues with the steam pipe connection between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 (position x=15.5, y=70.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 (position x=18.5, y=70.5)\n- Electric mining drill 3 (position x=21.5, y=70.5)\n- Transport belt system (from position x=18.5, y=72.5 to x=26.5, y=72.5)\n- Wooden chests for collecting ore (positions x=15.5, y=72.5; x=18.5, y=72.5; x=21.5, y=72.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=16.5, y=72.5)\n- Small electric poles (positions x=18.5, y=66.5; x=18.5, y=68.5)\n\nThe mining drills are not receiving electricity. The wooden chest at position x=15.5, y=72.5 contains 129 iron ore. The burner inserter has coal fuel but its output is blocked as there is no destination entity to accept the output.\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at position(28.0, 73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 (position x=28.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 2 (position x=30.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 3 (position x=32.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 4 (position x=34.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 5 (position x=36.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 6 (position x=38.0, y=73.0)\n\nFive of the six furnaces are actively smelting iron ore into iron plates, with furnace 3 waiting for ingredients. All furnaces have coal fuel. The furnaces have accumulated a significant number of iron plates (28, 27, 23, 24, 24, and 24 respectively) that need to be extracted.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at position(-55.5, 79.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 (position x=-55.5, y=79.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 (position x=-52.5, y=79.5)\n- Electric mining drill 3 (position x=-49.5, y=79.5)\n- Transport belt system (from position x=-55.5, y=81.5 to x=-53.5, y=81.5)\n- Transport belt system (from position x=-49.5, y=81.5 to x=-44.5, y=81.5)\n- Wooden chests for collecting ore (positions x=-52.5, y=81.5; x=-49.5, y=81.5)\n- Small electric poles (positions x=-52.5, y=75.5; x=-52.5, y=77.5; x=-47.5, y=77.5)\n\nThe mining drills are not receiving electricity. The wooden chests have been emptied, but the mining drills are still showing a warning that the chests are full.\n\n### Copper Smelting at position(-45.0, 80.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=-45.0, y=80.0)\n\nThe furnace is actively smelting copper ore into copper plates and has accumulated 33 copper plates that"}
