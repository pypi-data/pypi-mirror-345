{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, y=-80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, y=-82.0) supplying iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, y=-80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, y=-71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, y=-73.0) supplying copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, y=-71.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Output Blockage\n- Ensure that the output from mining drills is not blocked by items on the ground. There should be a sink entity, such as a furnace or a chest, to accept the output from the mining drill.\n\n### Errors Related to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and supply the required ores to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'stone-furnace', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-plate', and 'copper-plate'.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities present on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
