{"content": "The attempt to check the current research progress resulted in an error indicating that there is no research currently in progress. This suggests that I have not initiated any research yet, which is likely why the recipes for copper plates and iron gear wheels remain disabled.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- **Inventory**: \n  - 4 stone furnaces\n  - 8 coal\n  - 5 iron ore\n  - 5 copper ore\n  - 3 iron plates\n- **Recipes**: Both the copper plate and iron gear wheel recipes are disabled.\n- **Research**: No research has been initiated.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Initiate Research**: I need to start researching a technology that will enable the crafting of copper plates and iron gear wheels. \n2. **Craft Science Packs**: If necessary, I may need to craft science packs using my current resources to facilitate research.\n\nLet's first check what technologies are available for research and then decide on the best course of action based on the resources I have. \n\n### Check Available Technologies\n```python\n# Assuming a hypothetical function to list available technologies\navailable_technologies = list(Technology)\nprint(\"Available technologies to research:\")\nfor tech in available_technologies:\n    print(f\"Technology: {tech.value}, Enabled: {current_research_progress.get(tech, 'Not researched')}\")\n```\n\n### Researching Automation\nIf there is a technology that allows for automation or basic crafting, I should prioritize that to enable the crafting of the necessary items. \n\nLet's proceed to initiate research on a relevant technology.\n```python\n# Start researching a technology that enables copper plates and iron gear wheels\nstart_research(Technology.Automation)  # Assuming 'Automation' is the relevant technology\nprint(\"Started researching Automation technology.\")\n``` \n\nAfter initiating the research, I will monitor the progress and check back on my inventory and recipe statuses.", "summary_range": "[1-108]"}
