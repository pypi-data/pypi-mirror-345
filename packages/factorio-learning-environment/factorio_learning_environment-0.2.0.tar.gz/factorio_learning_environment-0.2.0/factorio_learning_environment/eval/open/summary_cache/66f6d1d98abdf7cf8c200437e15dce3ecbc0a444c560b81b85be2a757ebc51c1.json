{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with full input inventory and frequent output extraction.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) used for staged storage of iron plates, with frequent iron plate transfers between them.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, feeding chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace output persists, limiting mining drill throughput.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and iron plate storage with active coal fueling and power connectivity, though output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal and working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, generating power.\n- Small electric poles placed near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5) and (17.5, 72.5), connected to the power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates, with frequent iron plate insertions into assembler.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) previously placed but currently picked up due to placement errors.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) picked up recently due to placement distance errors.\n- Assembling machine intermittently receives iron plates but still reports ingredient shortage preventing crafting.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production with power and input chest supply, but output inserter and some burner inserters were removed due to placement issues, impacting throughput.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts and distance limitations\n- Multiple failures to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) due to tile occupancy by mining drill and water tiles.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) were picked up but failed to be replaced due to \"target position too far away\" errors (max placement distance 10, target ~78).\n- To avoid these errors:\n  - Always verify tile availability and occupancy before placement.\n  - Move closer to the target position before placing entities to respect maximum placement distance.\n  - Consider repositioning entities to accessible tiles and increasing spacing or changing direction if collisions occur.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational when placed.\n- Recent pickup of these inserters due to placement errors has temporarily halted their function.\n- Continue to monitor inserter fuel levels and inventories to prevent stoppages once re-placement is successful.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) intermittently receives iron plates but often reports ingredient shortage preventing iron gear wheel crafting.\n- Input and output inventories of assembling machine are frequently empty or contain residual items, indicating inconsistent input supply or output handling.\n- Ensure continuous and sufficient iron plate supply to the assembler input chest.\n- Re-establish output inserter functionality to move assembled items into output chest.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" limiting output flow.\n- Furnace input inventory frequently full, indicating smelting output is not being"}
