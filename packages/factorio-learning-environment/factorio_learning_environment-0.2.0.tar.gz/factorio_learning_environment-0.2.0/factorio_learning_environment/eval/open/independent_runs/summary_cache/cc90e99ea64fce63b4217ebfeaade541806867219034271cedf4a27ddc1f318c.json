{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (-16.0, -49.0) with a Burner Inserter at Position (-17.5, -48.5)\n- Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) with a Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -47.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnaces to chests and inserters for efficient iron plate production\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -46.5)\n- Iron Chest at Position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Multiple Burner Inserters and BeltGroups facilitating the movement of items between chests and production facilities\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab connected to the power grid, positioned at an unspecified location, with no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that there is no blockage in the path when connecting entities like poles or pipes. Check for any existing structures that might obstruct the connection path.\n\n### Errors When Setting Research\n- Verify the availability of the required technology and resources before setting research. Ensure that the lab is powered and has the necessary science packs.\n\n### Errors When Using Inserters\n- Make sure that the destination of the inserter is not blocked. Check for any obstructions that might prevent the inserter from placing items onto belts or into chests."}
