Check the surrounding area for any existing entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check the position for any existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Make sure that all power-consuming entities are connected to a power network. Check the connections of small electric poles and ensure they are properly linked to the electricity group."}
