{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=52.5, y=-84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) connected to a series of transport belts leading to a wooden chest at position (x=-21.5, y=-65.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Coal Transfer System at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) picking up from a wooden chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Belt Systems\n- Multiple belt groups connecting various entities, facilitating the transport of resources such as copper ore and iron ore across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Placement\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the intended source entity. Verify the pickup and drop positions before placing the inserter.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Output\n- Ensure there is a destination entity available to accept the output from the inserter to avoid blockage. Check for any items on the ground that may obstruct the inserter's operation.\n\n### Fuel Management for Mining Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations."}
