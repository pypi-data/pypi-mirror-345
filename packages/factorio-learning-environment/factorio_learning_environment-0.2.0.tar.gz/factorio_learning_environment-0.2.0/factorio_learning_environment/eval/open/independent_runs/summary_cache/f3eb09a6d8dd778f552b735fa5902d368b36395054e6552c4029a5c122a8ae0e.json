{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) via a series of transport belts.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) via a series of transport belts.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0), both without ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Connected by a Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Connected by a Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of multiple belt groups connecting various entities, facilitating the movement of materials across different parts of the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connectivity\n- Ensure the belts are correctly oriented and connected. Errors such as \"list index out of range\" and \"'Chest' object has no attribute 'outputs'\" indicate issues with belt connectivity or incorrect assumptions about entity attributes.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters are providing the necessary items. Inserters at positions (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) are waiting for source items, indicating a possible supply chain issue.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Drills at positions (53.0, -83.0) and (-23.0, -68.0) are out of fuel.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Furnaces at positions (-20.0, -70.0), (-18.0, -70.0), (-19.0, -65.0), and (0.0, 0.0) are without ingredients."}
