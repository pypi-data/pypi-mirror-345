{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting complex near position (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to lack of output sink\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Two wooden chests at positions (16.5, 75.5) and (19.5, 75.5) used for furnace output storage\n- Burner inserter at position (20.5, 75.5) feeding coal into the stone furnace\n- Small electric pole at position (17.5, 69.5) connected to power network to supply the mining drill\n\n### Steam power generation setup near position (0.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, connected to offshore pump by pipes\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently not connected to power network\n- Small electric poles near steam engine (0.5, 3.5) and boiler (-4.5, -0.5) to distribute electricity\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing wooden chests near furnaces\n- Multiple attempts to place wooden chests at or near positions (16.5, 75.5), (18.5, 76.5), and (19.5, 75.5) failed due to existing entities blocking placement.\n- To mitigate, check for existing entities before placing chests and increase spacing or change placement direction to avoid collisions.\n- Consider using alternative positions around the furnace or removing obstructing entities before placement.\n\n### Errors placing burner inserter near furnace output chests\n- Failed to place burner inserter at (19.5, 75.0) due to collision with an existing wooden chest.\n- Mitigation involves verifying free space before placing inserters, increasing spacing, or adjusting direction to avoid overlap with other entities.\n\n### Power connection and entity attribute errors\n- Attempted to access non-existent 'energy' attribute on ElectricityGroup object causing AttributeError.\n- When checking power sources, ensure to query correct attributes from individual electric poles or generators, not from the electricity group as a whole.\n- Electric mining drill initially had no power; after connecting poles, it still showed warnings about output blockage. Ensure power network is properly connected and output sinks (e.g., chests or belts) are placed to accept mined items.\n\n### Coal insertion error in mining drill\n- Attempted to insert coal into electric mining drill caused an exception because electric drills do not use fuel.\n- Avoid inserting fuel items into electric mining drills; only burner drills require fuel.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
