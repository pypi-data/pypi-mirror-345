{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Expanded Power System at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Output connection point at (-9.0, -0.5)\n  - Connected to pipe at (-8.5, -0.5)\n- **Boiler cluster** (4 units)\n  - Boiler at (-8.0, 0.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Boiler at (-7.0, 1.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Boiler at (-8.0, 2.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Boiler at (-7.0, 0.5) facing RIGHT (new)\n- **Steam engine** at (-2.5, 0.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Still not connected to any boiler outputs\n- **Pipe network**\n  - Pipe segment at (-8.5, -0.5) connected to pump\n  - Isolated pipe segments at (-8.5, 0.5) and (-7.0, -0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Fluid Connection Issues\n- Repeated pipe placement failures between (-9.0, -0.5) and boiler inputs\n  - Clear existing entities before pipe placement attempts\n  - Verify exact connection points for offshore pumps (must match output direction)\n  - Use underground pipes with proper spacing (minimum 4 tiles between ends)\n\n### Underground Pipe Placement Failures\n- Multiple failed underground pipe placements at (-9.0, 1.5-3.0)\n  - Check for existing entities before placing underground pipe exits\n  - Ensure minimum clearance of 1 tile around pipe endpoints\n  - Verify underground pipe direction matches connection path\n\n### Boiler Connection Problems\n- Continued boiler placement and connection issues\n  - Boiler input must be on opposite side from steam output\n  - Ensure pipe connections align with boiler's input points\n  - Maintain minimum 2-tile spacing between boilers\n\n### New Placement Collision Errors\n- Repeated placement failures at (-8.0, -0.5) and (-7.5, -0.5)\n  - Implement systematic position scanning before placement\n  - Maintain minimum 1-tile spacing between all components\n  - Clear existing pipes before placing new connections\n\n### Connection Validation Improvements\n- Multiple connection validation failures\n  - Verify source and target entities are different before connecting\n  - Check connection point directions match\n  - Implement pre-connection validation checks\n\n### Offshore Pump Specific Issues\n- Continued pump output connection failures\n  - Offshore pump output is fixed at (-9.0, -0.5) when facing RIGHT\n  - Must connect directly to this position first before routing to boilers\n  - Cannot connect to pump from arbitrary positions\n\n### New Clearing Procedure Needed\n- Failed attempts to clear pipe placement areas\n  - Implement proper entity removal before placement\n  - Verify area is clear after removal attempts\n  - Check for hidden entities that might block placement"}
