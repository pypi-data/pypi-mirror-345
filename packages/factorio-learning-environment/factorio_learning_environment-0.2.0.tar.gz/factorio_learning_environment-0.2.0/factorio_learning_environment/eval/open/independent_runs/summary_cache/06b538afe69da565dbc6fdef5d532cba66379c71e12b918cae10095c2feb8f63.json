{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, here is the current state report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at x=-2.5 y=24.0\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at x=-9.5 y=24.5 producing water\n- Water pipe network connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Boiler at x=-2.5 y=24.0 (currently out of fuel)\n- Steam pipe network from boiler to steam engine\n- Steam engine at x=4.5 y=24.5 (not receiving steam)\n- Electric poles connecting steam engine to power network\n\n### Science Lab Complex\nMultiple labs spread across the map at positions:\n- Lab at x=10.5 y=0.5\n- Lab at x=18.5 y=3.5\n- Lab at x=11.5 y=6.5\n- Lab at x=4.5 y=11.5\n- Lab at x=23.5 y=13.5\nCurrently researching Automation technology\n\n### Inserter Production Line at x=23.5 y=2.5\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at x=23.5 y=2.5\n- Input burner inserter at x=21.5 y=2.5\n- Output burner inserter at x=25.5 y=2.5\n- Input wooden chest at x=20.5 y=2.5 containing 36 inserters\n- Output wooden chest at x=26.5 y=2.5\n\n### Logistics Science Pack Production at x=32.5 y=5.5\n- Assembling machine 1 at x=32.5 y=5.5\n- Small electric pole at x=30.5 y=7.5\n\n### Smelting Area\nMultiple furnaces at:\n- Furnace at x=0.0 y=0.0\n- Furnace at x=2.0 y=0.0 (contains 5 iron plates and 39 coal)\n- Furnace at x=4.0 y=4.0 (contains 50 coal)\n- Furnace at x=6.0 y=4.0\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Connection Errors\n- When connecting pipes between entities, ensure the connection points are valid and entities are properly aligned\n- Use correct pipe prototypes - regular pipes vs underground pipes based on distance and obstacles\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones in a location\n- Ensure there is enough space for the entity's full dimensions when placing\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Cannot craft items that require machine assembly (like iron plates) directly - must use appropriate production buildings\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft\n\n### Research Requirements\n- Research prerequisites must be completed before starting new research (e.g. Automation before Electronics)\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Ensure steam engines are properly connected to boilers via pipe network\n- Keep boilers fueled to maintain power generation\n- Connect all machines requiring power to the electrical network via power poles\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure required items (like pipe-to-ground) are in inventory before attempting placement\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner devices"}
