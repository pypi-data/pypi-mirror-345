- **Air Quality**: Real-time and forecast air quality data with detailed pollutant information

## Installation

```bash
pip install unoff-qweather-mcp
```

## Authentication

This package requires a QWeather API key. You'll need to:

1. Register for an account at [QWeather Developer Platform](https://dev.qweather.com/)
2. Create an API key in the developer console
3. Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export QWEATHER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export QWEATHER_API_HOST="api.qweather.com"  # or another appropriate host based on your subscription
```

The API host depends on your subscription tier. See [QWeather API Configuration](https://dev.qweather.com/docs/configuration/api-config/#api-host) for details.
