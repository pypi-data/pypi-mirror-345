{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\n- Burner inserter at position(x=53.5, y=-79.5) (out of fuel)\n- Wooden chest at position(x=54.5, y=-79.5) (contains iron plates)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) (out of fuel)\n- Wooden chest at position(x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Burner inserter at position(x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n- Burner inserter at position(x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n\n#### Storage Area at position(x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position(x=0.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- Wooden chest at position(x=1.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- Wooden chest at position(x=2.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- Wooden chest at position(x=3.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- Wooden chest at position(x=4.5, y=0.5) (contains coal and iron ore)\n- Wooden chest at position(x=5.5, y=0.5) (contains iron ore, plates, and gear wheels)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining Drill Not Working\n- Ensure the burner mining drill at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) has sufficient fuel to operate. Add coal to its inventory.\n- Check if the chest at the drop position(x=-14.5, y=-48.5) is full. Empty it to allow the drill to continue mining.\n\n#### Burner Inserter Out of Fuel\n- The burner inserter at position(x=53.5, y=-79.5) is out of fuel. Add coal to its inventory to resume operation.\n\n#### Furnace No Ingredients\n- The stone furnace at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0) has no ingredients to smelt. Ensure iron ore is being supplied to the furnace via the inserter.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- The burner inserter at position(x=42.5, y=-80.5) is waiting for source items. Ensure the chest at position(x=41.5, y=-80.5) contains items to be transferred.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `drill`: Represents the burner mining drill at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0).
