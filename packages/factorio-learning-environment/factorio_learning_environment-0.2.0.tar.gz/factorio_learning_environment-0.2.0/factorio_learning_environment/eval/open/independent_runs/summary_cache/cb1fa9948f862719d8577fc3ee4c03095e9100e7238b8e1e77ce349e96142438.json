{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Smelting Setup at y=0\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at position (0, 0) - Currently idle, no ingredients but has coal fuel and 6 iron plates in output\n- Stone furnace at position (4, 0) - Currently idle, no ingredients but has coal fuel and 11 iron plates in output\n\n###Coal Mining Setup at y=-86\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (40, -86) - Operational with coal fuel, currently working\n- Iron chest at position (40.5, -84.5) - Collecting coal directly from drill, contains 28 coal\n- Transport belt system:\n  * Belt group connecting drill output to chest position\n  * Belt running from (42.5, -84.5) to (40.5, -84.5)\n  * Belt group running from (38.5, -83.5) to (41.5, -83.5)\n\n###Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at y=-75\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (0, -75) - Operational with coal fuel, currently working\n- Stone furnace at position (1, -73) - Working, processing iron ore with coal fuel, contains 10 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when trying to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Before attempting to place entities (like stone furnaces), ensure you have crafted or obtained the required entity first\n- Check inventory contents before placement attempts to avoid placement failures\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items requiring sub-ingredients\n- When crafting complex items like burner mining drills, ensure all sub-ingredients are either in inventory or can be crafted directly\n- For items requiring smelted materials (like iron plates), these must be obtained from furnaces rather than trying to craft them directly\n- Plan the crafting sequence to first obtain base materials before attempting to craft more complex items\n- Raw resources like wood cannot be crafted and must be gathered from the environment\n\n### Errors when trying to connect entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items (like transport belts) in your inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Craft the required connection items before attempting to establish connections between entities\n\n### Errors when trying to insert fuel into entities\n- Make sure you have the required fuel type (like coal) in your inventory before attempting to fuel entities\n- Collect or mine the necessary fuel before attempting to power burner-type entities\n\n### Errors related to entity output blockage\n- When a drill shows \"waiting for space in destination\", ensure the furnace is placed exactly at the drill's drop position\n- Double-check the exact drop position coordinates before placing collecting entities\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if the target position is already occupied by another entity before attempting to place new entities\n- If the target position is occupied, choose a different valid position for placement\n\n### Errors with incorrect entity placement positions\n- Place entities exactly at the designated drop positions when connecting to other entities\n- For furnaces collecting from mining drills, ensure they are placed precisely at the drill's drop position"}
