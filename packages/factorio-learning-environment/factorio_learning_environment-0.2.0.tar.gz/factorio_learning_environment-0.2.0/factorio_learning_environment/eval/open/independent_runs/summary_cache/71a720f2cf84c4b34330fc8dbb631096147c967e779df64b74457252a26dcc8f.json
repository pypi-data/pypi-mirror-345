{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete/In Progress)\nCurrently consists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) facing up, working and producing water\n- Boiler placement attempts at various positions, currently no stable boiler placement\n- No steam engine connected\n- System is not functional due to placement and fuel issues\n\n### Manufacturing Complex\nLocated in the positive coordinate quadrant, consists of:\n1. Smelting Line:\n- Four stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (5.0, 0.0), and (8.0, 0.0)\n- Burner inserter at (3.5, 0.5) connecting furnaces\n\n2. Assembly Line:\n- Wooden chest at (4.5, 1.5) and (8.5, 1.5) for material storage\n- Inserter at (9.5, 1.5) for material transfer\n- Assembling machine at (11.5, 1.5) for automation science pack production\n- Output inserter at (13.5, 1.5)\n- Storage chest at (14.5, 1.5) for finished products\n\n3. Secondary Smelting Area:\n- Two stone furnaces at (4.0, 4.0) and (6.0, 4.0)\n- Inserter at (4.5, 2.5) for material handling\n\n4. Research Complex:\n- 10 labs connected to electricity group 41055 (currently unpowered)\n\n5. Transport System:\n- Multiple belt groups forming a logistics network:\n  - Belt group from (4.5, 2.5) to (2.5, 2.5)\n  - Belt group from (6.5, 2.5) to (4.5, 2.5)\n  - Long belt group from (7.5, 3.5) to (-4.5, 19.5)\n  - Belt group from (1.5, 5.5) to (1.5, 11.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a location\n- Ensure boiler placement doesn't overlap with water tiles\n- Verify entity orientation before placement to ensure proper connections\n\n### Resource Access Errors\n- Move closer to target entities before attempting to extract resources\n- Verify inventory contains required items before attempting to insert them\n- Ensure proper access to fuel source before attempting to fuel entities\n\n### Power System Setup Errors\n- Complete the full power system setup (offshore pump -> boiler -> steam engine) before expecting operation\n- Ensure proper orientation and connection of power system components\n- Verify fuel availability before attempting to power boilers\n\n### Entity Connection Errors\n- Ensure entities are properly aligned and connected in the correct sequence\n- Verify power network connections for electrical entities\n- Check fluid connections between water systems and boilers\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Verify resource availability in inventory before attempting to use them\n- Ensure proper extraction of resources before attempting to use them\n- Double check inventory after mining operations to confirm resource acquisition"}
