{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) with iron plates in the result inventory.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with iron plates in the result inventory.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with iron plates in the result inventory.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Inserters positioned at (-17.5, -47.5), (-15.5, -47.5), and (-13.5, -47.5) are waiting for source items.\n  - Inserters positioned at (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), and (-12.5, -45.5) are waiting for source items or space in destination.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) is empty.\n- **Transport Belts**:\n  - Transport belts connecting various positions, including (-14.5, -44.5) and (-12.5, -44.5).\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Transport belts at positions (-14.5, -44.5), (-12.5, -44.5), and verified at (-14.5, -44.5).\n- Belt groups connecting different sections of the facility, ensuring the movement of items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Non-existent Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to interact with exists at the specified position. This includes verifying the presence of transport belts and chests before attempting to place or manipulate them.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Orientation and Functionality\n- Regularly check the orientation of inserters to ensure they are facing the correct direction for item transfer.\n- Address any warnings or status issues such as \"WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\" or \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" by ensuring there are source items available and that the destination has space.\n\n### Errors with Obstructions\n- Before placing new entities, verify that the target tile is unoccupied to avoid obstruction errors. Remove any existing obstructions if necessary.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Always verify the availability of space and the correct type of entity before attempting placement to avoid errors related to non-existent entities or occupied tiles."}
