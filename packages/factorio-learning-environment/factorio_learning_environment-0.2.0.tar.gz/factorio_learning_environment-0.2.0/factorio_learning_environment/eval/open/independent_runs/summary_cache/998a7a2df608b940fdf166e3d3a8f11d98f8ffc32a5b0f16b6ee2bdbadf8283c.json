{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (-16.0, -49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a furnace source of iron ore. The furnace result is iron plates.\n- **Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a furnace source of iron ore. The furnace result is empty.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (-13.5, -47.5) with pickup position (-13.5, -48.5) and drop position (-13.5, -46.5).\n  - At position (-14.5, -45.5) with pickup position (-14.5, -46.5) and drop position (-14.5, -44.5).\n  - At position (-9.5, -44.5) with pickup position (-8.5, -44.5) and drop position (-10.5, -44.5).\n  - At position (-14.5, -43.5) with pickup position (-14.5, -44.5) and drop position (-14.5, -42.5).\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Belt Groups**:\n  - Belt group connecting various positions to facilitate the movement of items between entities.\n\n### Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Belts**:\n  - Belt at position (-16.5, -47.5) outputting towards (-16.5, -46.5).\n  - Belt at position (-14.5, -46.5) outputting towards (-14.5, -47.5).\n  - Belt at position (-12.5, -46.5) outputting towards (-11.5, -46.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not full. If an inserter is waiting for space, check the destination inventory and make sure there is enough space to accommodate the items being transferred.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Output\n- If an inserter's output is blocked by an item on the ground or there is no sink entity to accept the output, ensure that there is a clear path for the inserter's output and that the destination entity can accept the items.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Verify that entities are placed in appropriate positions and that there is no overlap with other entities. Ensure that belts and inserters are correctly aligned to facilitate smooth item transfer."}
