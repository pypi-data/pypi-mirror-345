Reposition if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters to prevent interruptions in operations.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Regularly check the chest for iron ore levels to ensure continuous supply to the furnace.\n- Empty the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to prevent it from becoming full and halting mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting. Adjust the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving iron ore."}
