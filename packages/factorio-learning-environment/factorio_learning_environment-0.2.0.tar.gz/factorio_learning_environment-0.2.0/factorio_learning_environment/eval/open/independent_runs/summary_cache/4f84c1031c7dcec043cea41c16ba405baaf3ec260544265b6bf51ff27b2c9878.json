{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n  - At position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from furnaces to storage.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - At position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) storing produced iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) storing produced iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inserter Fueling\n- Ensure all inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from stalling.\n\n### Errors Related to Inserter Waiting for Space\n- Make sure the destination of the inserter is not full to avoid stalling. Regularly clear out or manage the inventory of destination entities.\n\n### Errors Related to Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and maintain the supply chain to prevent shortages.\n\n### Errors Related to Code Execution\n- UnboundLocalError: Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and associated with a value before accessing them.\n- ValueError: When using functions that require specific types of arguments, ensure that the correct type is passed. For example, when inspecting inventory, pass an Entity or Position object instead of an incorrect type like an integer.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Shortages\n- Regularly monitor and replenish the fuel supply for all burner entities, including mining drills and furnaces, to ensure continuous operation."}
