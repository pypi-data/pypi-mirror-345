{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal as fuel, actively working.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with coal as fuel, actively working, currently processing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storage purposes.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with coal as fuel, currently inactive due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, actively working.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storage purposes.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. For instance, the copper furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) is inactive due to a lack of ingredients to smelt.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity, used in the context of inserting items."}
