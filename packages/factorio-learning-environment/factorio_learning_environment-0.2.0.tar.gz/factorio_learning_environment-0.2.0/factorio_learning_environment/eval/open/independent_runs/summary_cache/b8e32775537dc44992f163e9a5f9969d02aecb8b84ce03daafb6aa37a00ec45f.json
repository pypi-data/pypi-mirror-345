{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the lab\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to the electricity network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure copper ore is available before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors When Using Undefined Variables\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined before use. For example, ensure 'copper_cable_needed_for_poles' is defined before using it in calculations.\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Connections\n- Verify that entities are correctly connected. For example, ensure pipes are properly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors with Entity Status Checks\n- Ensure entities like the steam engine are properly fueled and connected to work. For example, ensure the steam engine is connected to the boiler and has a working status.\n\n### Errors When Using Incorrect Entity Types\n- Ensure the correct entity type is used in code. For example, verify the correct use of 'Lab' in code to avoid NameError.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain sufficient coal inventory to refuel boilers and ensure continuous operation of the steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Research and Lab Usage\n- Ensure the lab is correctly identified and connected to the power network before starting research tasks."}
