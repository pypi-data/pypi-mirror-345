{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Primary Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Water source (now working)\n- **Boiler** at (-6.0, -0.5) - Steam production (now fueled with coal)\n- **Steam engine** at (-0.5, -0.5) - Power generation (now connected)\n- Connected pipe network (fluid system 2679) with water flow\n- Separate steam pipe network (fluid system 2681)\n\n### Secondary Power Attempt (New)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 19.5) - Water source (not connected)\n- **Boiler** at (-7.5, 20.0) - Steam production (out of fuel)\n- **Steam engine** at (-4.5, 20.5) - Power generation (not connected)\n- No functional fluid connections established\n\n### Circuit Production Setup (Updated)\n- **Assembling machine 2** at (-5.5, 3.5) - Now powered but missing ingredients\n- Connected to power pole at (-3.5, 1.5)\n- Warning: Missing iron plates and copper cables\n\n### Remote Production Outpost\n- **Assembling machine 2** at (50.5, 50.5) - Circuit production (no power)\n- **Wooden chests** at (48.5, 50.5) and (52.5, 50.5) - Empty storage\n- Connected to power pole at (49.5, 48.5)\n\n### Mining Operations (Unchanged)\n- Iron drill at (15.5, 70.5) - Output still blocked\n- Copper drill at (-46.5, 70.5) - Output still blocked\n- Associated furnaces at (16.0, 74.0) and (-46.0, 74.0) - Inactive\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid Connection Issues (Recurring)\n- Failed pipe connections between offshore pumps and boilers\n- Solutions:\n  1. Verify connection point alignment (pump output must face boiler input)\n  2. Ensure no gaps in pipe networks\n  3. Check fluid types match (water \u2192 boiler, steam \u2192 engine)\n\n### Placement Collisions (Persistent)\n- Multiple failed chest/inserter placements due to existing objects\n- Implement:\n  1. Pre-placement area scanning\n  2. Alternate position selection algorithm\n  3. Clearance verification before placement\n\n### Distance Limitations (Recurring)\n- Entity placement attempts beyond 10-tile range\n- Required actions:\n  1. Maintain proximity during builds\n  2. Implement position validation before placement\n  3. Use temporary power poles for remote construction\n\n### Power System Optimization\n- Secondary power plant remains non-functional\n- Prioritize:\n  1. Complete one functional system before expanding\n  2. Verify all connection points\n  3. Maintain continuous coal supply\n\n### Production Bottlenecks\n- Assemblers show ingredient shortages\n- Address:\n  1. Establish reliable plate production\n  2. Implement automated ingredient delivery\n  3. Monitor input inventories\n\n### Previous Unresolved Issues\n- Mining drill outputs still blocked\n- Remote assembler remains unpowered\n- Secondary power plant incomplete\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `find_clear_land_near_power()` -> Position\n  - Still failing due to undefined dependencies\n  - Needs error handling implementation\n\n### Important Variables\n- `steam_engine`: Primary power generator reference\n- `boiler`: Active steam producer reference\n- `offshore_pump`: Functional water source reference"}
