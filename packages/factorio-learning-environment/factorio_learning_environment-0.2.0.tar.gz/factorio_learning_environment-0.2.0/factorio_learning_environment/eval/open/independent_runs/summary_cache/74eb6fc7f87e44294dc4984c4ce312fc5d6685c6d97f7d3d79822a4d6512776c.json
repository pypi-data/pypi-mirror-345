{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - **Function**: Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n  - **Status**: Working, but chest at drop position is full.\n  - **Fuel**: Coal.\n  - **Neighbours**: \n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5)\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - **Function**: Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n  - **Inventory**: Contains iron ore and iron plates.\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5)\n  - **Function**: Additional storage capacity.\n  - **Inventory**: Empty.\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - **Function**: Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n  - **Fuel**: Coal.\n  - **Status**: No ingredients to smelt.\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5)\n  - **Function**: Transfers items between chests.\n  - **Fuel**: Coal.\n  - **Status**: Waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., wooden chest) contains the items you intend to extract. Verify the inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target tile is occupied by another entity. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure there is sufficient space and no obstructions such as other entities or terrain features like water.\n\n### Errors when Processing in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to process into iron plates. Regularly check and supply the required materials to avoid production halts."}
