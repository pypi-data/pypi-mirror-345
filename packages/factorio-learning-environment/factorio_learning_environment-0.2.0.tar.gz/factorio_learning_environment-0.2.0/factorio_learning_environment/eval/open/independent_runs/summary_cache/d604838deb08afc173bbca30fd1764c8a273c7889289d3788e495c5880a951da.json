{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5) and (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5) and (-8.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions for fluid transport\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (17.5, -0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Power Connectivity\n- Ensure that all steam engines and inserters are connected to the power network. Check connections to electric poles and ensure they are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Errors in Liquid Connectivity\n- Verify that all boilers and offshore pumps are correctly connected with pipes to ensure the fluid can reach the steam engines. Ensure there are no gaps in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Make sure inserters are powered and have access to source items. Check the positioning and connectivity to power sources and ensure they are correctly aligned with the items they need to move.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Presence\n- Ensure that offshore pumps and boilers have access to water and that there are no blockages in the fluid connections. Check the fluid connections and ensure they are correctly configured.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type. This will prevent placement errors and ensure optimal layout."}
