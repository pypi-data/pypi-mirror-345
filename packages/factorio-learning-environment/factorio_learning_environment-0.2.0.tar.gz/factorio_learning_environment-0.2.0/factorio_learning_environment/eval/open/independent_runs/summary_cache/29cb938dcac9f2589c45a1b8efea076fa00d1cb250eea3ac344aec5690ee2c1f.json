{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -84.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the chest and other entities.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the transport belt to the chest.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the chest and other entities.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Additional Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnace to the chest and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### KeyError: 'character'\n- Ensure that the entity name 'character' is correctly referenced in the code. This error indicates that the entity 'character' is not found in the prototype_by_name dictionary. Verify that the entity is correctly defined and accessible.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
