{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### First furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with a full inventory of coal (50) and producing iron plates (currently has 5 iron plates).\n\n### Second furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (2.0, 0.0)) with a full inventory of coal (47) and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Third furnace at position (4.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (4.0, 0.0)) with a full inventory of coal (50) and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Fourth furnace at position (6.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (6.0, 0.0)) with a partial inventory of coal (3) and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (8.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (8.5, 0.5)) with an empty inventory.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has the required items to extract before attempting to extract. The furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) was found to have no iron plates available for extraction.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has available inventory space before inserting items. The furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) reported being full, preventing the insertion of coal. \n\n### Errors when harvesting\n- Make sure to gather resources from patches without exceeding the inventory limits. \n\n### Errors when crafting\n- Ensure that there are enough raw materials available in the inventory to craft the desired items. The agent reported not having enough iron plates to craft iron gear wheels.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The agent repeatedly encountered issues extracting iron plates from the first furnace and inserting coal into it due to the full inventory. Adjust inventory management to prevent these repeated errors."}
