{"content": "Based on the provided logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around x=41-44, y=-80 to -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt system:\n  - Input belt at (41.5, -80.5) facing right\n  - Output belt at (42.5, -80.5) facing right\n- Stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0) facing up\n\nCurrent Status: The mining drill is waiting for space in destination, belts are partially blocked with coal, and the furnace has no ingredients but has fuel.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, ensure there is adequate clear space for the new entity\n- Multiple failed attempts to place inserter at various positions due to existing objects:\n  - (42.5, -81.0)\n  - (42.5, -81.5)\n  - (42.5, -82.0)\n  - (42.0, -81.0)\n  - (41.5, -81.5)\n\n### Belt Management\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to place new entities or when mining operations are stalled\n- The mining drill is currently blocked because the output belt at (41.5, -80.5) is full\n\n### Entity Validation\n- Always verify an entity exists at a position before attempting to interact with it\n- Use proper error handling when attempting to get entities at specific positions\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity() - Places entities at specified coordinates\n  - Failure modes: Fails when target location is occupied by other entities\n  - Success modes: Successfully places entity when space is available\n\nImportant Variables:\n- None identified in provided logs"}
