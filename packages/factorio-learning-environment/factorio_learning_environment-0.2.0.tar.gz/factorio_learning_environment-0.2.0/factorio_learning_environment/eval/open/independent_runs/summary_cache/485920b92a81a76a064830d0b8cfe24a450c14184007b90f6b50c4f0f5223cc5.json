{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around x=45, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input wooden chest with iron ore at (45.5, -79.5)\n- Output wooden chest with iron plates at (49.5, -80.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters being placed and repositioned (positions changing throughout logs)\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Two iron chests storing coal at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Additional wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing inserters, verify the target location is free from other entities\n- Multiple attempts to place inserters failed due to existing objects in the way at positions like (45.0, -80.5) and (45.5, -80.0)\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Coal mining system has stopped due to full output chests. Implement a system to manage chest contents before they become full\n- Furnaces lack ingredients despite having fuel. Ensure proper item flow from input chests to furnaces\n\n### System Design Issues\n- Multiple attempts to fix inserter positions and orientations suggest need for better initial placement planning\n- Consider planning entity layouts before placement to avoid repeated adjustments\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the world. Fails when target location is occupied.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter\n\nExecution shows multiple attempts to place and reorient inserters with varying success rates. Main failure mode is attempting to place entities in occupied spaces."}
