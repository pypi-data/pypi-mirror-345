{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (22.5, -4.5), (24.5, -7.5), and (24.5, -6.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-11.0, 20.0) with a wooden chest at position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, 20.0) with a wooden chest at position (19.5, 18.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (10.5, 0.5) with a small electric pole at position (11.5, -1.5)\n- Inserter at position (7.5, 5.5) with a wooden chest at position (8.5, 5.5)\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-3.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5), (-3.5, 2.5), and (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Inserter at position (-3.5, 1.5) with a wooden chest at position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Pipe Groups and Electricity Groups interconnecting various entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with PipeGroup\n- Ensure that you are accessing valid attributes of the PipeGroup object. The 'direction' and 'fluid_box' attributes do not exist on PipeGroup. Use the correct attributes available for PipeGroup.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of boilers to ensure continuous operation. Keep a stock of fuel nearby or automate the refueling process.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the required source items. Check the supply chain to ensure that items are being delivered to the inserters.\n\n### Assembling Machine Missing Resources\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has the necessary ingredients to produce the desired items. In this case, ensure a steady supply of copper plates for copper cable production."}
