There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: [Ingredient(name='iron-ore', count=40000)]\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the placement location is free of other entities or items before attempting to place a new entity, such as a Burner Inserter, Wooden Chest, or Transport Belt.\n\n### Errors in retrieving entities from the map\n- Verify the existence and correct positioning of entities before attempting to retrieve them using the API. Ensure the coordinates match an existing entity's position.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from drills to prevent blockage and maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- Confirm the destination position is valid and free of obstructions before attempting to move an entity like a Stone Furnace."}
