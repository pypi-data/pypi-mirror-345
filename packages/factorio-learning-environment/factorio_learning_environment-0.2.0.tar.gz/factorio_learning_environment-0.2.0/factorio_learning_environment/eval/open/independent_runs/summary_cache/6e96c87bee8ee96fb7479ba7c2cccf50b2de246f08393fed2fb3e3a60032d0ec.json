{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Laboratory Setup\n- Lab with automation-science-pack input but no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that the connection points are not obstructed and that the pipes are placed correctly to allow fluid flow.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Before attempting to craft items, ensure that all required raw resources are available in the inventory. For crafting small electric poles, gather the necessary amount of wood beforehand.\n\n### Errors When Setting Research\n- Confirm that the lab is connected to the power network and has the required science packs. Also, ensure that a valid research project is selected in the research interface.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel or Ingredients\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients for smelting to avoid idle time.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Verify that all electrical entities, such as inserters, are connected to an active power network. Ensure that the power network is functional and supplying sufficient electricity to all connected devices."}
