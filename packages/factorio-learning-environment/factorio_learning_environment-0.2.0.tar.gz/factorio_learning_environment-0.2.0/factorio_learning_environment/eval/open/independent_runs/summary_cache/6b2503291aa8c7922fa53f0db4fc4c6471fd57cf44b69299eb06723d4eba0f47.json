Repeated attempts to craft and place a Lab have failed because the required Lab item was not present in the inventory and the necessary sub\u2010ingredients were unavailable.\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace (Utilized) at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0)\nA pre\u2010existing furnace used to convert iron ore (with coal support) into additional iron plates. Its output is critical for meeting the sub-ingredient requirements in subsequent crafting, even though it was not newly constructed by the agent.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace (Utilized) at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nA pre\u2010existing copper furnace employed to process copper ore into copper plates. These copper plates support the production chain for copper cables and related intermediate components. No new smelting structure has been built by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Issues with get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid mixing keyword and positional arguments. In one instance the use of a \u2018radius\u2019 keyword caused an unexpected argument error, and in another the function was supplied with positional arguments despite not accepting any. Verify the correct function signature before invocation.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Iteration Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the required Lab item is present in the inventory prior to attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that get_entities returns a proper iterable (and not None) before performing operations such as filtering.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all sub-ingredients in the Lab\u2019s crafting chain (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, and the associated raw materials) are sufficiently available.\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor and update resource inventory levels and ensure that smelting or processing steps yield the necessary outputs to satisfy higher-tier recipes.\n\u2003\u2013 Review the crafting dependencies to prevent recurring shortages that block Lab production."}
