{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal with inventory of 700 coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the drill to the chest, currently waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) used for refilling, currently empty.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) processing iron ore into iron plates, currently with 2 iron ore and 88 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) processing iron ore into iron plates, currently with 3 iron ore and 87 iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) storing coal for the furnaces, each with 5 coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to pick up. In this case, the burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) is waiting for source items. Verify the supply chain to ensure continuous item flow.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities present on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
