{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Stone furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, currently inactive due to no ingredients.\n- Stone furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Multiple wooden chests positioned at (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5) for storage.\n- Burner inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), (20.5, 0.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located at an unspecified position, currently inactive due to no power.\n\n### Fluid Transport System\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- Various pipe groups positioned across the map, including positions like (17.5, 3.5), (-0.5, 11.5), (5.5, 18.5), and others, all currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity group with poles positioned at various locations, such as (1.5, 10.5), (10.5, 13.5), and others, currently with no voltage.\n\n### Offshore Pump System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-11.5, 26.5), currently not connected to any fluid system.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Usage of `pickup_entity` Function\n- Ensure that when using `pickup_entity`, only the entity is passed without specifying a position. The function does not accept a second argument as a Position object.\n\n### Attribute Error with `ElectricityGroup`\n- Verify that the correct attributes are being accessed for objects. The `ElectricityGroup` object does not have a `prototype` attribute. Ensure the correct usage of object attributes.\n\n### Connection Failures with Pipes\n- When connecting pipes, ensure that the correct types (`Pipe`, `UndergroundPipe`) are used and that the positions are correctly specified. Check that the entities being connected are at the expected positions and are compatible.\n\n### Obstructions and Entity Placement\n- Clear any obstructions before attempting to place entities. Ensure that the target position is free of other entities or obstacles to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Ensure that boilers and steam engines are correctly aligned and connected with appropriate pipes. Verify that the positions are accurate and that there are no gaps in the connection."}
