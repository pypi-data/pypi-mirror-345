{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a coal resource count of 20,000 and currently fueled with 13 units of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal between chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing 794 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) containing 422 units of coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with 5 units of coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with 13 units of coal, also not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) containing 5 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) containing 5 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) containing 5 units of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Lack of Smelting Ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the input inventories and ensure that the required resources are available for processing.\n\n### Efficient Resource Management\n- Monitor the coal distribution among chests and furnaces to avoid shortages in critical areas. Consider automating the coal distribution process to maintain optimal operation of all entities.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities present on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
