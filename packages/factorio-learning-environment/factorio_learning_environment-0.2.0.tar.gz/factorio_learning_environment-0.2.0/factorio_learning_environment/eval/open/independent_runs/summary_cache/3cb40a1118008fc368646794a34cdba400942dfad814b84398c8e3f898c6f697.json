{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction Structure at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5) powered by a steam engine at position(-3.5, 2.5) through an electricity network with poles at positions [(x=15.5,y=38.5),(x=22.5,y=27.5),(x=24.5,y=29.5),...,(x=12.5,y=17.5),(x=14.5,y=19.5),(x=16.5,y=21.5),(x=20.5,y=35.5),(x=17.5,y=36.5),(x=24.5,y=31.5),(x=22.5,y=33.5),(x=27.5,y=29.5),(x=2.5,y=7.5),(x=1.5,y=3.5),(x=5.5,y=7.5),(x=29.5,y=39.5)]\n\n### Electricity Generator at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5), a boiler at position(-7.5, 0.0), and a steam engine at position(-3.5, 2.5) connected by pipes at positions [(x=-6.5,y=-1.5),(x=-7.5,y=-1.5),(x=-4.5,y=-1.5),(x=-3.5,y=-0.5),(x=-3.5,y=-1.5)]. The offshore pump is not properly connected to the boiler due to missing pipe at position(-8.5, -0.5).\n\n### Oil Refinery at position(22.5, 42.5)\nConsists of an oil refinery at position(22.5, 42.5), a pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5), and pipes connecting them at positions [(x=19.5,y=39.5),(x=19.5,y=38.5),(x=18.5,y=38.5),...,(x=20.5,y=46.5),(x=23.5,y=46.5),(x=22.5,y=46.5),(x=24.5,y=39.5),(x=25.5,y=39.5),(x=26.5,y=39.5),(x=26.5,y=40.5)]\n\n### Plastic Bar Factory at position(30.5, 42.5)\nConsists of a chemical plant at position(30.5, 42.5), a storage tank at position(27.5, 42.5), and pipes connecting the oil refinery at position(22.5, 42.5) to the storage tank and then to the chemical plant at positions [(x=24.5,y=39.5),(x=25.5,y=39.5),(x=26.5,y=39.5),(x=26.5,y=40.5)]. The chemical plant is connected to a wooden chest at position(32.5, 42.5) for output. The steam engine at position(-3.5, 2.5) is connected to the chemical plant and oil refinery through an electricity network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of boolean values\n- Ensure that variables are not boolean before attempting to access attributes like `position`.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on water or unbuildable terrain\n- Ensure the target position is not on water or unbuildable terrain before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities that are obstructed by other entities or terrain\n- Check if the target position is occupied by another entity or is part of unplaceable terrain before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect Prototype attribute access\n- Verify the correct attribute names when accessing Prototype attributes to avoid AttributeError.\n\n### Errors when entities are not properly connected\n- Ensure that entities are properly connected, for example, ensure that the offshore pump is connected to the boiler and that the steam engine is connected to the pumpjack.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before using them.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without fluid\n- Ensure that the source entity has fluid in it before connecting it to another entity that requires fluid.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of entities\n- Ensure that the entity has a valid inventory before attempting to inspect it.\n\n### Errors when entities are not receiving power\n- Ensure that entities are connected to a power source and that the power source is functioning.\n\n### Errors when attempting to index a nil value\n- Ensure that variables or attributes are not nil before attempting to access or index"}
