{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\n- Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, facilitating fluid movement. The pipe groups are located at various positions, including:\n- PipeGroup at position(-12.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position(-9.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position(-10.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup at position(-6.5, 23.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure that the area where you are attempting to place the small electric pole is clear of other entities to avoid placement failures.\n\n### Errors when reconnecting steam engine to power network\n- Verify that all connections to the power network are properly established and that there are no obstructions preventing the steam engine from receiving power.\n\n### Errors related to fluid connections\n- Check that the offshore pump is properly connected to the water source and that the boiler has access to the necessary input liquid to function correctly.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
