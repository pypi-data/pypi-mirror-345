{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=13.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=8.5, y=-0.5), (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), (x=20.5, y=-0.5), (x=8.5, y=1.5), (x=17.5, y=1.5), (x=19.5, y=1.5).\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), (x=20.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=17.5, y=3.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=5.5, y=18.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=21.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=18.5, y=21.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=22.5, y=20.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=22.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=14.5, y=22.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=16.5, y=23.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=7.5, y=24.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=5.5, y=27.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=35.5, y=27.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of an ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=7.5, y=8.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that the path between the offshore pump at (x=-11.5, y=26.5) and the boiler at (x=-3.5, y=26.0) is clear and that appropriate pipes or underground pipes are used for connection.\n\n### Errors in Placing Pipes\n- Before placing pipes, check for obstacles at the intended positions such as (x=-10.5, y=26.5) to (x=-4.5, y=26.5). Clear any obstructions to ensure successful placement.\n\n### Errors in Using Pickup Entity Function\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that the second argument is a Position object if required. If the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None.\n\n### Errors in Refueling Boiler\n- Verify the presence of the boiler at the specified position (x=-3.5, y=26.0) before attempting to refuel. Ensure that the entity exists and is accessible."}
