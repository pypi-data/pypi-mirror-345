{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 1.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Ensure the target tile for placing a chest is not obstructed by other entities. Check for nearby obstructions before attempting to place the chest.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect API usage\n- When using objects like `Position`, ensure they are accessed correctly. For example, avoid treating `Position` objects as callable.\n- When defining dimensions or using prototypes, ensure the correct data types are used to prevent issues like type errors.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure there is sufficient iron ore in the inventory to supply to furnaces to avoid production halts.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the inventory and ensure all necessary resources are available for ongoing operations.\n- Verify the placement logic and ensure the positions are valid and free from obstructions before attempting to place entities."}
