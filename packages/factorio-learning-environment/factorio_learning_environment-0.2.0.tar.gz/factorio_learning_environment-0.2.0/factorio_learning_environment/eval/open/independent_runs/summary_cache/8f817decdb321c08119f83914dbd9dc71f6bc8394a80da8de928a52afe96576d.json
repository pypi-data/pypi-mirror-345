This will prevent failures like \"Could not extract\" or \"No iron ore available.\"\n\n### Errors when Clearing Chests\n- Verify that the player is in range and has the necessary permissions or conditions to clear chests. This will address issues such as \"Failed to clear coal/iron ore chest at drop position.\"\n\n### Errors when Transferring Items to Furnaces\n- Confirm that there is sufficient iron ore in the inventory or storage before attempting to transfer to furnaces. This will mitigate errors like \"No iron ore available in player inventory to transfer to furnace.\"\n\n### Errors when Placing Additional Storage\n- Ensure that the required storage entity (e.g., wooden chest) is available in the inventory before attempting to place it. This will prevent errors like \"Could not place wooden-chest at (x, y), No wooden_chest in inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when Mining Drill Operations\n- Regularly check and empty the chests at drop positions to avoid warnings like \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest to continue mining.\""}
