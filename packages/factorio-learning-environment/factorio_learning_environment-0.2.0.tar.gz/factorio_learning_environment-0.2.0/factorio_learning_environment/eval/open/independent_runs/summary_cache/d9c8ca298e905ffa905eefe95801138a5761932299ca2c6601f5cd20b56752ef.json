{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently working with an inventory of 50 iron-ore and 100 iron-plate. The furnace has been observed to be full and out of fuel at various points.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0) which is currently working and has been fueled with coal. It extracts resources from the surrounding area.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which contains iron-ore and has been used to extract resources.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) which contains coal and has been used to extract resources.\n\n### Burner Inserters\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) which is currently waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) which is currently waiting for space in the destination.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Stone Furnace\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace has sufficient fuel before attempting to insert items. It has been observed to be out of fuel, resulting in a status of NO_FUEL.\n\n### Errors with Burner Mining Drill\n- The Burner Mining Drill has repeatedly reported NO_FUEL status. Make sure to provide coal to the drill to keep it operational.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Inserters are often waiting for source items or space in the destination. Ensure that there are items available in the source and that the destination has space before inserting.\n\n### Errors when extracting from chests\n- When extracting items from chests, ensure that the chest has enough items to extract. The logs show instances of extracting from chests that may be low on resources.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int (total count of iron ore collected)\n- `coal`: int (total count of coal collected)\n- `iron_plate`: int (total count of iron plates produced)\n- `wood`: int (total count of wood collected)\n- `iron_gear_wheel`: int (total count of iron gear wheels produced)"}
