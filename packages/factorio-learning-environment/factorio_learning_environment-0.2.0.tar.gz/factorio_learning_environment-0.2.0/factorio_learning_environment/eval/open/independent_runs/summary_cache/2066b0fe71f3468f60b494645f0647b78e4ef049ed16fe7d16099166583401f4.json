{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0), which is currently working, fueled by coal, and extracting iron ore. It has a warning indicating that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, with no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0), which is fueled by coal and has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt. It is currently holding iron plates in its result inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target location for placing entities such as Stone Furnace, Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, and Transport Belt is unoccupied and suitable for placement. This will prevent errors like \"Cannot place [Entity] at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when Moving Entities\n- Verify that the destination location for moving entities like Stone Furnace is valid and unoccupied to avoid errors such as \"Cannot move Stone Furnace to the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when Accessing Non-existent Entities\n- Before attempting to access an entity at a specific position, ensure that the entity exists at that location to prevent errors like \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.5 y=-53.0.\"\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Address warnings related to output blockage by ensuring there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like Burner Mining Drills. This will prevent the output from being blocked by items on the ground.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt Warnings\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt.\" This can be achieved by connecting the furnace to a source of raw materials."}
