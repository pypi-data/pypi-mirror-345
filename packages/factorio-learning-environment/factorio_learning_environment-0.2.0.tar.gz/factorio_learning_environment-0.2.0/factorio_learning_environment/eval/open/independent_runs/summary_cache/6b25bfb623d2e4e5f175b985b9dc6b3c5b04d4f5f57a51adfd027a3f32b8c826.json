{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) producing 639.49 water per 60 seconds\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) with coal fuel (44 coal) \n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) producing 632.34 steam per 60 seconds\n- Connected by pipes forming a water and steam system (fluid systems 1705 and 1707)\n- Small electric pole at position (0.5, 8.5) providing power distribution\nThe system is currently working at optimal efficiency and forms the power backbone of the factory.\n\n### Coal Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-8.5, 6.5) containing 450 coal\n- Wooden chest at position (-2.5, 1.5) containing 496 coal\nThese chests serve as manual coal storage for the boiler, with a total of 946 coal in storage, providing approximately 2.5 hours of operational autonomy.\n\n### Crude Oil Production System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pumpjack at position (20.5, 43.5) extracting from crude oil resource (299,980 units remaining)\n- Small electric poles connecting to the power grid at position (19.5, 41.5)\n- Five storage tanks in sequence:\n  - Storage tank 1 at position (26.5, 46.5) containing approximately 17.45 crude oil\n  - Storage tank 2 at position (34.5, 49.5) containing approximately 1.95 crude oil\n  - Storage tank 3 at position (42.5, 52.5) containing approximately 0.15 crude oil\n  - Storage tank 4 at position (50.5, 55.5) currently empty\n  - Storage tank 5 at position (58.5, 58.5) currently empty\n- Connected by an extensive pipe network (fluid system 1709)\nThe system is currently working at optimal efficiency and producing approximately 858.73 crude oil per 60 seconds, which is 335% of the target production rate of 250 crude oil per 60 seconds.\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nAn electricity network (ID: 2056) connecting the steam engine to the pumpjack, allowing the oil production system to function. The network consists of multiple small electric poles spanning from the power generation area to the oil field, with poles at various positions including (0.5, 8.5), (0.5, 12.5), (0.5, 24.5), (11.5, 41.5), (15.5, 41.5), and (19.5, 41.5). The network is stable with a voltage of 213,000.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is already occupied\n- When placing inserters or other entities near existing structures, ensure there's enough clearance\n- Consider using the get_buildable_positions API to find valid placement locations\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items that aren't in inventory\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items\n- Keep track of resource consumption, especially for frequently used items like coal\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Verify that entities exist before trying to access them using index operations\n- Use conditional checks before accessing list elements (e.g., `if len(list) > 0:`)\n- Consider using try/except blocks when accessing potentially non-existent entities\n\n### Errors with fluid connections\n- Ensure proper pipe connections between fluid-handling entities\n- Verify that pipe networks form continuous paths without gaps\n\n### Errors when placing entities on unsuitable terrain\n- Check the terrain type before attempting to place entities like pumpjacks\n- Water tiles and other special terrain may prevent entity placement\n- Use the map view to identify suitable locations for placement\n\n### Errors when accessing list indices out of range\n- When iterating through lists or accessing list elements, ensure the index is within bounds\n- Use conditional checks to verify list length before accessing elements\n- Consider using safer access methods like `get()` for dictionaries or try/except blocks"}
