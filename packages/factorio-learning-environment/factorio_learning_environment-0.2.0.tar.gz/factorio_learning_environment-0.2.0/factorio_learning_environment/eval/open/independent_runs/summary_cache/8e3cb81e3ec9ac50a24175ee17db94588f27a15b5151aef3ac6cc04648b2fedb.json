{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (1.5, -0.5) with a transport belt leading to a Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (3.5, -0.5) with a transport belt leading to a Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.5, 1.5) with a transport belt leading to a Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 1.5) transferring items from the furnace to a transport belt\n- Transport Belt network connecting the furnace to other facilities\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, facilitating the transport of materials across the map\n- Specific belts connecting positions such as (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 1.5) and others, indicating a complex network for material transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup object is correctly initialized and accessed with valid attributes. Avoid using non-existent attributes like 'prototype'.\n\n### Name Errors with TransportBelt\n- Verify that all classes and variables are correctly defined and imported. Use the correct class names and ensure they are accessible in the current scope.\n\n### Placement Errors due to Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target tile is free of other objects. Consider using a function to verify the availability of space before attempting placement.\n\n### Connection Errors with Belts\n- When connecting belts, ensure there is a valid path and that the belts are aligned correctly. Use appropriate functions to check for valid connections and paths.\n\n### Handling Errors with Missing Entities\n- When handling entities like inserters or chests, ensure they exist at the specified positions. Implement checks to confirm the presence of these entities before performing operations.\n\n### Timeout and Sleep Errors\n- Avoid using sleep functions that may cause timeouts. Consider using event-driven or callback mechanisms to handle delays and wait conditions.\n\n### Fuel and Resource Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Inserters and Stone Furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations."}
