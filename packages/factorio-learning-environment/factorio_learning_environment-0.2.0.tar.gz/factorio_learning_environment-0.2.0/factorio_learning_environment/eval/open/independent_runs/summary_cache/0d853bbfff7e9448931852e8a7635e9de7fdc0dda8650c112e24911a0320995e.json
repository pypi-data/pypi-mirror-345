{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), fueled by coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storage and transfer of materials.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-13.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -46.5) for moving materials between entities.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -46.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-4.5, -48.5) are used to store large quantities of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Blockage and Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the drop position for inserters is not blocked and that there is space in the destination.\n- Regularly check and clear blockages to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- When extracting items, ensure the entity has the required items available for extraction.\n- Verify the quantity requested for extraction is available in the source entity."}
