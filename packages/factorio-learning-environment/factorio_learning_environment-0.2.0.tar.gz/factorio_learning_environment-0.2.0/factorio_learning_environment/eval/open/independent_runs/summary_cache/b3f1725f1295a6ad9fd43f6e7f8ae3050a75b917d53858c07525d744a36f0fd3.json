{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5) \n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0) \n- Offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5) \n- Multiple pipes connecting the boiler and steam engine, although currently not connected due to obstructions.\n\n### Lab at position(1.5, -12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position 1.5, -12.5)\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups at various positions:\n- PipeGroup (position -8.5, -6.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -7.5, -7.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -11.5, -4.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -9.5, -5.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -13.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -17.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -19.5, 27.5)\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of multiple small electric poles at various positions:\n- ElectricityGroup (id=99669)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure there are no obstructions between the boiler and steam engine when attempting to connect pipes. Check for entities blocking the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing lab\n- Ensure the position is not obstructed by other entities before attempting to place the lab.\n\n### Errors when steam engine is not connected to power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the electric network. Check the connections to nearby electric poles and ensure they are functional.\n\n### Errors with fluid connections\n- Check that the boiler has the necessary input liquid and that the connections are not obstructed. Ensure that the offshore pump is operational and connected to the boiler.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
