{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Drop chest at position (4.5, -58.5)\n- Storage chest at position (4.5, -56.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5)\n- Multiple wooden chests for storage at various positions including (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (4.5, -56.5)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions (-16.5, -54.5), (-17.5, -54.5), (-14.5, -54.5), (-15.5, -54.5), (-13.5, -54.5), (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -52.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5)\n- Iron chests at positions (-3.5, -52.5), (-6.5, -50.5), (-5.5, -50.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full drop chests. For example, the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, halting mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly supply furnaces with necessary ingredients to prevent them from stopping production. Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) are currently lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int"}
