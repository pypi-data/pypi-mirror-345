{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5) with status WORKING\n- Pipe Groups connecting these entities, with some sections EMPTY and others FULL_OUTPUT\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Pipe Group at position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) with status EMPTY\n- Pipe Group at position (x=21.5, y=-10.5) with status EMPTY\n- Pipe Group at position (x=5.5, y=-8.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, containing water\n- Pipe Group at position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, containing water\n\n### Furnace Operations\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with fuel (coal: 39) and status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with fuel (coal: 29) and status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with fuel (coal: 37) and status NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Inserter and Chest Setup\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) with status NO_POWER\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5) with status NORMAL\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, including (x=-2.5, y=-3.5) and (x=2.5, y=3.5), with status NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Non-existent Pipes\n- Ensure the target pipe exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing a new pipe. Remove any existing entities if necessary.\n\n### Errors in Boiler Water Supply\n- Ensure that the boiler's fluid box contains 'water' to avoid assertion errors. Check pipe connections to ensure water is flowing correctly.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Network Connection\n- Ensure all components are correctly connected to the electric network to avoid NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK status.\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine and Boiler Connection\n- Ensure that steam engines and boilers are properly connected to each other and to the water supply to avoid NOT_CONNECTED status."}
