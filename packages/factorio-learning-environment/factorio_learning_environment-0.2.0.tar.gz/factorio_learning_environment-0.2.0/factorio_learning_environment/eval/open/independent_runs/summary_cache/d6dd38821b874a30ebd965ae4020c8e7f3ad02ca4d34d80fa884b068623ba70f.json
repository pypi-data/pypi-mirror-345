{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (-14, -53)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the belt to the chest\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates\n- Transport Belt network facilitating movement of materials between furnaces and inserters\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (53, -83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) with a drop position at (52.5, -84.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-23, -68)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage Facility at Position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to interact with is properly initialized and exists in the game world.\n\n### AttributeError: 'BeltGroup' object has no attribute 'direction'\n- Verify that the object you are working with has the expected attributes and methods. Ensure that you are using the correct object type for the operation.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Check the alignment of the inserter and ensure that the source supply is available and correctly positioned to feed the inserter."}
