{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with status `NO_FUEL` and warnings about the chest being full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) containing iron ore, with status `NORMAL`.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) with status `WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`, connected to the mining drill and a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to the furnace system.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status `NO_INGREDIENTS` and warnings about the result being full.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) with status `WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`, connected to the transport belt and the stone furnace.\n- **BeltGroup** with inputs from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) and outputs from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all burner entities, such as mining drills and inserters, are adequately fueled to prevent operational stoppages.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors with Belt and Inserter Blockages\n- Continuously monitor belt and inserter systems for blockages to maintain smooth operation and avoid production delays.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **check_belt_and_inserter_status**: A function to monitor the status of belts and inserters for blockages. Ensure it is called periodically to maintain system efficiency.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: A dictionary maintaining the current inventory status, e.g., `{'wood': 2, 'coal': 5, 'stone': 5, 'iron-ore': 242, 'iron-plate': 922}`."}
