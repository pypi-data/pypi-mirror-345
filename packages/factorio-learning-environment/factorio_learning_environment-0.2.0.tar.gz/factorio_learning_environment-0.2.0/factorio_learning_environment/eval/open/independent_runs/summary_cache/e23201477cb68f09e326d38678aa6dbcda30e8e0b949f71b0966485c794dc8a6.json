{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) currently out of ingredients\n\n### Inserter and Power Connection at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) not receiving electricity\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=-3.5, y=2.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=-2.5, y=2.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, you needed 20 iron plates to craft iron gear wheels but only had 19.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items\n- Verify that the items you are trying to insert exist in your inventory. Attempting to insert non-existent items, such as the automation science pack, will result in errors.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Electrical Entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to connect electrical entities. For example, connecting a small electric pole failed due to missing items in the inventory.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Check the power connections and ensure that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole to function correctly."}
