{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine with pipes at various positions\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnaces at Positions (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=10.0, y=0.0), (x=13.0, y=0.0), and (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), and (x=20.5, y=-0.5)\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests\n\n### Research Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab connected to power with Electric Poles at Positions (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), and (x=1.5, y=6.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Research Initiation\n- Ensure that the research prerequisites are met and that the lab is properly configured and powered before initiating research.\n\n### Inserter Configuration Errors\n- Verify that inserters have a valid source and destination. Ensure that the source contains items and the destination has space to accept items.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check the configuration of inserters to ensure they are correctly aligned with the source entity and that the source entity contains the necessary items.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accept items from the inserter. Consider adding more storage or managing inventory to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the power grid and that the power supply is sufficient for all connected entities.\n\n### Errors When Refueling Boilers\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in the inventory before attempting to refuel boilers."}
