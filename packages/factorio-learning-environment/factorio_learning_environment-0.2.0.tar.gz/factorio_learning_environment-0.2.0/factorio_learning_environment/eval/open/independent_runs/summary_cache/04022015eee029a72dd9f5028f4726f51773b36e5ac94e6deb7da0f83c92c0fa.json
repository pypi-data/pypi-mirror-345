{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a report summarizing the existing structures and error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (Position x=0.0-2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel:\n- Furnace 1 at position(0.0, 0.0) \n- Furnace 2 at position(2.0, 0.0)\nBoth furnaces are processing iron ore into iron plates and are coal-powered\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position x=4.0, y=4.0)\nSingle stone furnace dedicated to copper plate production:\n- Furnace 3 at position(4.0, 4.0), coal-powered\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Assembly Line (Position x=6.5-12.5, y=11.5)\nAutomated assembly line consisting of:\n- Input chest at position(6.5, 11.5) storing iron plates\n- Input burner inserter at position(7.5, 11.5)\n- Assembling machine at position(9.5, 11.5) crafting iron gear wheels\n- Output burner inserter at position(11.5, 11.5)\n- Output chest at position(12.5, 11.5) storing finished iron gear wheels\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=-9.5 to -2.5, y=22.5-24.5)\nSteam-based power system consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting water flow\n- Boiler at position(-7.0, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5, 24.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting power to facilities\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab researching Logistics technology, connected to the power grid\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource shortage errors\n- Check inventory before attempting to insert items into machines\n- Ensure you have the required resources before attempting insertion operations (coal for boiler, iron ore for furnaces)\n\n### Recipe requirement errors\n- Ensure all recipe ingredients are available before starting assembly operations\n- For iron gear wheel production, maintain adequate iron plate supply in the assembler input\n\n### Inventory management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner inserters and boilers\n- Keep track of raw material supplies (iron ore, copper ore, coal) and harvest when running low"}
