{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-5.5, 24.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -5.5, 24.5), boiler (position -6.0, 24.5), and offshore pump (position -5.5, 24.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0).\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0).\n\n### Lab at position(2, -19)\nConsists of the lab entity (position 2.0, -19.0).\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of multiple small electric poles located at:\n- (x=-1.5, y=3.5)\n- (x=0.5, y=1.5)\n- (x=0.5, y=3.5)\n- (x=-5.5, y=15.5)\n- (x=-5.5, y=19.5)\n- (x=-5.5, y=24.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This includes confirming that the position is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors when attempting to access entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position before calling functions on it. In this case, ensure that a lab exists at position (2, -19) before trying to get its position.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power, such as labs, are connected to a power source to avoid issues with functionality."}
