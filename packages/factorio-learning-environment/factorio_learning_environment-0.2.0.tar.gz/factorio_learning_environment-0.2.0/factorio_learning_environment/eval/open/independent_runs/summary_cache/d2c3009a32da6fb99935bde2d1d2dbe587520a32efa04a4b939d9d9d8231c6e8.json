{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position: (-15.0, -50.0)) is currently working with a fuel inventory containing coal and a source inventory containing iron ore. The furnace has produced iron plates from iron ore.\n\n#### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position: (41.0, -82.0)) is currently working and has a fuel inventory containing coal. It is set to extract resources, but the drop position (wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)) is full, which prevents further mining.\n\n#### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position: (41.5, -80.5)) currently contains coal. This chest serves as a drop-off point for resources extracted by the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Error inserting into a full chest**: The Burner Mining Drill cannot continue mining because the chest at (41.5, -80.5) is full. To mitigate this, ensure that the chest is emptied regularly to allow for continued resource extraction.\n  \n- **Furnace warnings about no ingredients to smelt**: The furnace has displayed warnings indicating it has no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of iron ore in the furnace's source inventory to avoid this issue.\n\n- **Furnace warnings about being out of fuel**: The furnace has also shown warnings about being out of fuel. Regularly check and replenish the fuel inventory to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: No specific utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: Inventory (type: Inventory) - Represents the amount of coal available.\n  - `iron-ore`: Inventory (type: Inventory) - Represents the amount of iron ore available.\n  - `iron-plate`: Inventory (type: Inventory) - Represents the amount of iron plates produced.\n  - `wooden-chest`: Entity (type: Chest) - Represents the wooden chest's position and inventory.\n  - `stone-furnace`: Entity (type: Furnace) - Represents the stone furnace's position and inventory.\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: Entity (type: BurnerMiningDrill) - Represents the burner mining drill's position and inventory."}
