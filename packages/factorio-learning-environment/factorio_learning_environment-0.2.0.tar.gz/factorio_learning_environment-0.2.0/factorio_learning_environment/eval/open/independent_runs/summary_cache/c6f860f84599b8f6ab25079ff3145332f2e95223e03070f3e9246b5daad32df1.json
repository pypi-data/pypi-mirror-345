{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with iron ore input and no output.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) connected to the transport belt at (-21.5, -66.5) and the furnace at (-19.0, -65.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) connected to the furnace at (-19.0, -65.0) and the chest at (-16.5, -64.5).\n- Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport belt system connecting furnaces and inserters.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport belt system facilitating the movement of copper ore to the chest at (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) currently empty.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport belt system facilitating the movement of iron ore to the chest at (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) connected to the transport belt and chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using Inventory API\n- Ensure that the 'Inventory' object is accessed with valid attributes. The 'is_empty' attribute does not exist; consider using 'is_empty()' method or check inventory count directly.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Usage\n- Verify that transport belts are correctly positioned and connected to ensure items are moved efficiently. Ensure items are placed on belts and are not left empty.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operation\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Check fuel levels and ensure inserters are not waiting indefinitely for source items.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt and that output slots are not full to prevent production halts. Regularly check and clear output slots to maintain continuous operation."}
