{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler is responsible for heating water to produce steam, which is then used by the steam engine to generate electricity.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chests (positions: 46.5, -83.5; 48.5, -83.5; 5.5, -79.5; 10.5, -79.5) that store coal and other resources.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(2.5, -73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 2.5, -73.5) that extracts iron ore from the nearby deposit.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities such as the Offshore Pump. The error \"Cannot place Offshore Pump as it is not in inventory\" indicates that the agent needs to gather the necessary items first.\n\n### Errors when connecting structures\n- No pipes available. We cannot connect the Boiler to the Steam Engine. Ensure you have enough pipes in your inventory to connect the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
