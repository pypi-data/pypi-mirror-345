{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (21 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Out of fuel\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Warnings: Out of fuel\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated checks indicate that the furnace is not receiving iron ore due to possible misalignment.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the inserter to prevent it from running out of fuel. The inserter was noted to be out of fuel, which can halt the transfer process.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full. The mining drill's operation is halted when the chest at the drop position is full. Regularly extract items from the chest to maintain continuous operation."}
