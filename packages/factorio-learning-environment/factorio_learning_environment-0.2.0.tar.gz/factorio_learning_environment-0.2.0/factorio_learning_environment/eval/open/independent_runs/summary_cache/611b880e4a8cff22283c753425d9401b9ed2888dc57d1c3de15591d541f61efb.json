Validate the active fluid_system from a functional PipeGroup before initiating a connection.\n- Rigid Pipeline Stabilization:\n  - Fixed waiting periods of 10 seconds following each connection attempt introduce unnecessary delays. Replace static delays with dynamic connectivity checks to proceed as soon as the network stabilizes."}
