{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore, but frequently full output inventory causing stoppages.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal, feeding chests and furnace.\n- Small electric poles at (15.5, 75.5), (17.5, 72.5), (22.5, 75.5), and (12.5, 72.5) connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage has been partially addressed by removing some transport belts between furnace and input chests, but the mining drill still reports output blockage warnings.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and iron plate storage with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, though output flow remains partially constrained.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal and operational.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) generating power, connected to boiler by pipes.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5) and (17.5, 72.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and operational but still lacking sufficient iron plate input.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) currently empty.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Iron gear wheels have been inserted directly into the assembling machine, confirming crafting capability when materials are supplied.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and output inserters in place, now demonstrating successful crafting when iron plates are provided.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Multiple failed attempts to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) and steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to tile occupancy by mining drills or other entities.\n- Errors indicate collisions or placement on invalid tiles (e.g., water).\n- To avoid these errors, always check tile occupancy before placement.\n- Increase spacing, adjust placement direction, or select alternate reference positions to find valid placement tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters sometimes wait for source items due to empty input chests.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel and ensure input chests are stocked to prevent inserter idle time.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) previously unable to craft due to missing iron plates.\n- After direct insertion of iron gear wheels into the assembling machine, crafting confirmed functional.\n- Ensure continuous supply of iron plates to input chest to maintain crafting.\n- Clear output chests regularly to avoid output blockage.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" despite removal of some transport belts.\n- Furnace output inventory often full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Verify and clear output belts and chests to maintain flow.\n- Power network connectivity improved with additional poles placed at strategic positions.\n\n### API usage errors\n- Attempted to access non-existent attribute 'drop_position' on furnace entity caused AttributeError.\n- When connecting"}
