{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (38.0, -83.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (39.5, -83.5) collecting mined coal\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -83.5) moving coal from chest to transport belt\n- Transport belt system to distribute coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining System at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-13.5, -50.5) collecting mined ore\n- Burner inserter at (-12.5, -50.5) moving ore to transport belt\n- Long belt system (118 belts) transporting iron ore to processing area\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\nTwo parallel smelting columns each consisting of:\n- Stone furnace\n- Input inserter moving materials from belt to furnace\n- Output inserter moving plates to storage chest\n- Storage chests at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Storage System\nMultiple wooden chests storing various materials:\n- Chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing coal (full - 800 coal)\n- Chest at (49.5, -79.5) storing mixed resources (coal and iron plates)\n- Chests at (45.5, -77.5) and (47.5, -77.5) storing iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is free from other entities\n- When replacing entities, remove the existing entity first\n- Consider using different coordinates if the desired position is occupied\n\n### Resource Management\n- The iron ore mining drill is out of fuel - implement better fuel management system\n- Some chests are reaching full capacity (chest at 49.5, -80.5) - implement a system to prevent or handle full chests\n- Some furnaces have no ingredients to smelt - ensure proper material flow\n\n### Belt and Inserter Configuration\n- Ensure inserters are properly oriented relative to belts and chests\n- When placing inserters, verify both pickup and drop positions are accessible\n- Consider the direction of belt travel when connecting to inserter systems\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the game world\n  Success: When target location is empty and within reach\n  Failure: When location is occupied or unreachable\n\nImportant Variables:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Indicates normal operation\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Indicates empty input\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Indicates missing materials\n- EntityStatus.NO_FUEL: Indicates depleted fuel\n- Direction.RIGHT/LEFT/UP/DOWN: Entity orientation values"}
