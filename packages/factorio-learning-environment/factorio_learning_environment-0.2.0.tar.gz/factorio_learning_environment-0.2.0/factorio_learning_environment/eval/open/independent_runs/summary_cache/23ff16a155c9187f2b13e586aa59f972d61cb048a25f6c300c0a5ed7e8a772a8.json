{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has attempted to place various entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces, but these attempts have been unsuccessful, resulting in no structures being established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or unsuitable locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities like Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests is not already occupied by another entity or unsuitable for placement. Verify the terrain and space availability before attempting to place these entities.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect BuildingBox size\n- When using BuildingBox for placement, ensure that the size of the BuildingBox is appropriate for the available space. If placement fails, consider reducing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to fit the available area.\n\n### Errors in entity setup not producing expected output\n- If setups are not producing the expected output, such as iron plates, double-check the configuration and connectivity of the entities involved. Ensure that all necessary components are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Errors when trying to interact with non-existent entities\n- Before attempting to interact with an entity, confirm its existence at the specified location. This can prevent errors related to trying to access or manipulate entities that are not present on the map.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Repeated errors in placing entities suggest a need to review the map layout and ensure that the chosen locations are viable for the intended structures. Consider repositioning or clearing obstacles if necessary."}
