{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The boiler is connected to the offshore pump via pipes, although the connection is currently failing.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Lab at position(0, 0)\nConsists of a lab (position 0, 0) which is currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are placed correctly and that there are no obstructions between the offshore pump and the steam engine. Check the positions of the entities and ensure they are aligned properly to allow for successful connections.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
