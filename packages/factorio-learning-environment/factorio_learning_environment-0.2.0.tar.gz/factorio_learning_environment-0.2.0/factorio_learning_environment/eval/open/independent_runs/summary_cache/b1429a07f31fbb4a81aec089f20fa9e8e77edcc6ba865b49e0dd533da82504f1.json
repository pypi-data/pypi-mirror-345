{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to produce iron plates from iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore. It is currently fueled with coal and is operational, but the chest at its drop position is full, preventing further mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores extracted iron ore. It currently contains 16 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is fueled with coal and is waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which smelts iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as mining drills and inserters, have a sufficient supply of coal to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors from Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent production halts due to full inventory.\n\n### Errors from Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has a continuous supply of iron ore to maintain production of iron plates. Regularly transfer iron ore from storage to the furnace.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities efficiently. Reposition them as needed to ensure proper operation."}
