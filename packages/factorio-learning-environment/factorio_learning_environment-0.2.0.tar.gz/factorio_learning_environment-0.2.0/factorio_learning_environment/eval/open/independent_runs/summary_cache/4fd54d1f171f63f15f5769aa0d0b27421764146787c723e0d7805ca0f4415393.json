{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Resource Storage Area at Position (-10.5, -49.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position x=-10.5, y=-49.5) used for storing coal and iron ore. The chest inventory is frequently updated with resources moved from other chests.\n\n### Iron Ore Collection Point at Position (-11.5, -49.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position x=-11.5, y=-49.5) used for storing iron ore before it is transferred to the main storage area.\n\n### Coal Collection Point at Position (54.5, -78.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position x=54.5, y=-78.5) used for storing coal before it is transferred to the main storage area.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position x=-14.0, y=-49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently, the furnace inventory is full with iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors When Inserting into Full Inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory (e.g., stone furnace) has enough space before attempting to insert items. This can prevent failed insertions due to full inventory, as seen with the stone furnace at position x=-14, y=-49.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `iron_ore_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron ore in the chest at position x=-11.5, y=-49.5.\n  - `target_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal and iron ore in the chest at position x=-10.5, y=-49.5.\n  - `coal_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal in the chest at position x=54.5, y=-78.5.\n  - `stone_furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron plates in the stone furnace at position x=-14.0, y=-49.0."}
