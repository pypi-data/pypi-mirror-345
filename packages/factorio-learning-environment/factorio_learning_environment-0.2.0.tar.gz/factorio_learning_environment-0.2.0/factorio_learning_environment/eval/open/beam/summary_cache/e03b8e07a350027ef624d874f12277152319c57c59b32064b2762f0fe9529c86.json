{"content": "The attempt to move to the position (500, 500) has failed due to an inability to find a valid path from the current location to the target coordinates.

Let's try (0, -100) as a new exploration point.\n2. **Maximize Current Inventory**: I will continue to evaluate what can be crafted with the existing copper and iron resources to ensure some level of production continues.\n3. **Prepare for Broader Exploration**: If this exploration fails as well, I will need to rethink my exploration strategy and consider more systematic approaches.\n\nLet\u2019s move to the position (0, -100) to search for any potential resources.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to the position (0, -100) to search for iron or copper ore patches.\nnearby_exploration_position = Position(x=0, y=-100)\nmove_to(nearby_exploration_position)\n\n# Attempt to find both iron and copper resource patches at this nearby exploration position.\niron_ore_patch_nearby_exploration = get_resource_patch(Resource.IronOre, position=nearby_exploration_position)\ncopper_resource_patch_nearby_exploration = get_resource_patch(Resource.CopperOre, position=nearby_exploration_position)\n\n# Check if a new iron ore patch is successfully located\nif iron_ore_patch_nearby_exploration:\n    print(f\"Found an iron ore patch at the nearby exploration position: {iron_ore_patch_nearby_exploration}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No iron ore patches found at the nearby exploration position.\")\n\n# Check if a new copper ore patch is successfully located\nif copper_resource_patch_nearby_exploration:\n    print(f\"Found a copper ore patch at the nearby exploration position: {copper_resource_patch_nearby_exploration}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No copper ore patches found at the nearby exploration position.\")\n\n# Check entities on the map again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check if there are any new entities present.", "summary_range": "[1-346]"}
