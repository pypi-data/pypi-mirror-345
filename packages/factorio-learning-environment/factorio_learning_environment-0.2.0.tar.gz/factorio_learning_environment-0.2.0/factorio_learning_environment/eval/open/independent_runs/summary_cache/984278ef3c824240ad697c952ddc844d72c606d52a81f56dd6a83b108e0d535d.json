{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-3.5, 2.5)\nConsists of \n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-7.5, 0.0)\n- Steam engine at position(-3.5, 2.5)\n- Pipe connections between offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small electric poles connecting steam engine\n\n### Crude oil extraction at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of \n- Pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5)\n\n### Oil processing factory at position(22.5, 42.5)\nConsists of \n- Oil refinery at position(22.5, 42.5)\n- Chemical plant at position(27.5, 42.5)\n- Pipe connections between pumpjack, oil refinery, and chemical plant\n- Small electric poles connecting pumpjack, oil refinery, and chemical plant\n\n### Power network\nConsists of \n- Small electric poles connecting steam engine at position(-3.5, 2.5), pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5), oil refinery at position(22.5, 42.5), and chemical plant at position(27.5, 42.5)\n\n### Copper ore mine at position(-35.25, 47.75)\nConsists of \n- Copper ore patch at position(-35.25, 47.75)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before using them. (Step 8: 'oil_refinery' is not defined, Step 13: 'elect' is not defined, Step 29: bad operand type for unary -: 'type')\n\n### Errors when getting entities\n- Verify that entities exist at the specified position before attempting to access them. (Step 9: No entity of type oil-refinery found at the specified position, Step 19: No resource of type copper-ore at the specified location, Step 34: Could not get Prototype.ChemicalPlant at position x=0.0 y=0.0)\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that source entities have the required fluid before connecting to other entities. (Step 11: The source does not have fluid in it)\n- Ensure that entities have a recipe set before connecting them. (Step 12: Cannot connect to a Prototype.OilRefinery until a recipe has been set)\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target location is not occupied by another entity or water before placing. (Previous report, Step 23: Cannot place electric-mining-drill at the target location - something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable, Step 24, Step 27)\n- Ensure that the required items are in the inventory before placing entities. (Step 17: No solar_panel in inventory)\n\n### Errors when finding buildable positions\n- Ensure that the BuildingBox size is not too large for the available space. (Step 25, Step 28: No viable place to put Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill near the centre position)\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available and can be crafted before attempting to craft an item. (Step 18: Could not craft solar-panel due to missing copper-plate)\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of objects\n- Check the type and attributes of objects before accessing them. (Previous report)\n\n### Errors when asserting entity status\n- Verify that entities are receiving power or functioning as expected before asserting their status. (Previous report)\n\n### Errors when researching technologies\n- Ensure that the technology is not already researched before attempting to research it. (Step 31: Cannot research sulfur-processing because technology is already researched)\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `offshore_pump`: OffshorePump object\n- `boiler`: Boiler object\n- `steam_engine`: SteamEngine object\n- `pumpjack`: Pumpjack object\n- `oil_refinery`: OilRefinery object\n- `chemical_plant`: ChemicalPlant object\n- `copper_ore_patch`: ResourcePatch object\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity(entity_type, position)`: Places an entity of the given type at the specified position.\n    - Success mode: Entity is placed successfully.\n    - Failure mode: Entity cannot be placed due to occupied or invalid position, or missing required items in inventory. (Step 17, Step 23, Step 24, Step 27)\n- `connect_entities(entity1, entity2, connection_type)`: Connects two entities with the given connection type.\n    - Success mode: Entities are connected successfully.\n    - Failure mode: No valid connections found between entities, or source entity does not have required fluid, or recipe is not set.
