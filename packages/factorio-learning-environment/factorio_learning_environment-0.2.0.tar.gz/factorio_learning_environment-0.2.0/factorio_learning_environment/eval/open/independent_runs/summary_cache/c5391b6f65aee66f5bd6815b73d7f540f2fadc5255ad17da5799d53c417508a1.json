{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0) and (2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (0, 0)) with fuel inventory: {'coal': 15} and output inventory: {'iron-plate': 54}\n- Furnace (position (2, 0)) with fuel inventory: {'coal': 9} and output inventory: {'copper-plate': 93}\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, copper-plates are required to craft copper-cables, and iron-plates are required to craft electronic circuits.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace. For example, there were instances where the agent attempted to insert iron ore but had none available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when crafting electronic circuits\n- Ensure that you have enough iron-plates available to craft electronic circuits, as the crafting process requires a sufficient amount of this sub-ingredient."}
