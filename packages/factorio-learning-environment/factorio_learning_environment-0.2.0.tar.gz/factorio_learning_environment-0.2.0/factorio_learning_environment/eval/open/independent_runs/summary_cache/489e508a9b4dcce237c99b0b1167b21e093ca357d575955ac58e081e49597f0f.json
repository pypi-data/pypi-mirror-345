{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Smelting: Iron Ore (19 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5)\n  - Transfers iron plates from the furnace to the chest\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Pickup position: (x=0.5, y=0.5)\n  - Drop position: (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Plates (16 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=4.5, y=0.5)\n  - Transfers items from the belt to the chest\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Pickup position: (x=5.5, y=0.5)\n  - Drop position: (x=3.5, y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Ensure there is no collision with existing entities or terrain before placing a new entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use an inserter to input items into a chest instead of trying to connect belts directly to it.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, ensure you have enough iron plates to craft transport belts.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without having them\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures like furnaces.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates are needed to craft transport belts and must be smelted in a furnace."}
