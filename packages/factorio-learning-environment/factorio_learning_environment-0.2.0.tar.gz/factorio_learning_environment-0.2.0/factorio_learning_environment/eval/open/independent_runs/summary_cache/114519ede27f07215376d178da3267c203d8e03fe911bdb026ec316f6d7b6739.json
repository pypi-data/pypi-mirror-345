The first furnace is currently full (18/50 items), and the second furnace has limited capacity (6/50 items).\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Ensure that there are enough items in the furnace to extract. Both furnaces have reported \"no ingredients to smelt\" and cannot provide items for extraction.\n\n### Repeated failure to insert items\n- Avoid attempting to insert items into a furnace that is already full. Check the inventory of the furnace before making insertion attempts. \n\n### General inventory management\n- Monitor your inventory levels to avoid overloading furnaces and ensure a smooth crafting process."}
