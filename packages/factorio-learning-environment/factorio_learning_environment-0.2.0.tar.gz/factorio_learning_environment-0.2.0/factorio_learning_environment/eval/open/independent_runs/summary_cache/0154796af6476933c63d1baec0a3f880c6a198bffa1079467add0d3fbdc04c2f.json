{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (16.0, 71.0) and an Electric Mining Drill at position (18.5, 71.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mine at position (-46.0, 71.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (-46.0, 71.0)\n\n### Coal Mine at position (16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (16.0, 0.0)\n\n### Stone Mine at position (-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (-46.0, 0.0) and a Stone Furnace at position (-46.0, 3.0)\n\n### Electricity generator at position (-6.5, 0.0)\nConsists of an Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, -2.5), three Boilers at positions (0.0, -0.5), (-6.5, 2.0), and (-6.5, 0.0), and a Steam Engine at position (-3.5, -0.5). The Offshore Pump is connected to one of the Boilers with pipes at various positions. A Small Electric Pole is placed at position (-1.5, -0.5). The Steam Engine is connected to the Electric Pole.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing at position (23.5, 73.5)\nConsists of an Electric Furnace at position (23.5, 73.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Check if an entity already exists at the target position before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities near water or unplaceable terrain\n- Ensure that the target position is not on water or unplaceable terrain.\n\n### Errors when placing entities near other entities\n- Ensure that the target position is not too close to other entities that may interfere with the placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Verify that an entity of the specified type exists at the given position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent attributes of an object\n- Verify that the attribute exists for the given object before attempting to access it.\n- Be aware that certain entities, such as ElectricFurnace, do not have a 'neighbours' attribute.\n- Be aware that 'ElectricityGroup' objects do not have a 'neighbours' attribute.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them.\n\n### Errors when picking up non-existent entities\n- Verify that an entity exists at the target position before attempting to pick it up.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place an entity without having it in inventory\n- Ensure that the entity is in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place an entity on an unplaceable terrain\n- Ensure that the target position is on a placeable terrain.\n\n### Errors when accessing 'fluid' or 'fluid_systems' attribute of 'PipeGroup' object\n- Be aware that 'PipeGroup' objects do not have 'fluid' or 'fluid_systems' attributes in the classical sense. Instead, access the fluid information through the individual pipes within the group.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure that the source and target entities are correctly connected with pipes and that the connections are not blocked.\n- Verify that the target entity is able to receive the fluid from the source entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities to power network\n- Ensure that the entities are properly connected to the power network.\n\n### Errors when attempting to index a nil value\n- Be cautious when indexing values that may potentially be nil.\n\n### Errors when connecting steam engine to boiler\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are correctly connected with pipes.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drill`: BurnerMiningDrill, position of the drill\n- `furnace_pos`: Position, intended position of the furnace\n- `inserter_pos`: Position, intended position of the inserter\n- `boiler_pos`: Position, intended position of the boiler\n- `pole_pos`: Position, intended position of the pole\n- `copper_ore_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill, copper ore drill entity\n- `iron_ore_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill, iron ore drill entity\n- `x`: float, used in positioning entities\n- `offshore_pump`: OffshorePump, offshore pump entity\n- `electric_drill`: ElectricMiningDrill, electric mining drill entity\n- `pole`: SmallElectricPole, electric pole entity\n- `entity`: undefined variable, ensure it is defined before use\n- `steam_engine`: SteamEngine, steam engine entity\n- `boiler`: Boiler, boiler entity\n- `new"}
