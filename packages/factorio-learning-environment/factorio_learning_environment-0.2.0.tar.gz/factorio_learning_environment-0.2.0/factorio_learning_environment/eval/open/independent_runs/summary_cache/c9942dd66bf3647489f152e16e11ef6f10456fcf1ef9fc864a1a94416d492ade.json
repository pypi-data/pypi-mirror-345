{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts have failed due to various errors. The map remains empty of any constructed entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable positions\n- Ensure that the target position is buildable before attempting to place any entity. Verify the terrain and any existing obstructions that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied or restricted tiles\n- Check if the tile is already occupied or if there are global build restrictions before placing an entity. Attempting to place entities like Wooden Chests and Transport Belts on occupied or restricted tiles will result in failure.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for entity operation\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources available to operate entities like Furnaces. For example, ensure coal is available for Stone Furnaces to function.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the positions are valid and within the map boundaries before placing any entity."}
