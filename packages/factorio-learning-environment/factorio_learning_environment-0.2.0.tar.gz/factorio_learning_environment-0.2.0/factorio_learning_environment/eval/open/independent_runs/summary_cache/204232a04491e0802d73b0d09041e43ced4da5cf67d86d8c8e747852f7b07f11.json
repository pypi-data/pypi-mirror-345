{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(-10.0, -59.0)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row mining iron ore, each connected to a wooden chest:\n- Mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0) outputting to chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0) outputting to chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0) outputting to chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nNote: All drills currently out of fuel\n\n### Copper/Iron Processing Line at position(-28.0, -61.0)\nComplex consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Inserter at (-28.5, -58.5) feeding from drill to furnace\n- Inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving processed plates to storage chest\n- Storage chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n- Additional furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0) with inserters\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of four parallel smelting columns:\n1. First column:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Input chest at (0.5, -2.5)\n- Output chest at (0.5, 2.5)\n- Input inserter at (0.5, -1.5)\n- Output inserter at (0.5, 1.5)\n\n2. Second column:\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Input chest at (2.5, -2.5)\n- Output chest at (2.5, 2.5)\n- Input inserter at (2.5, -1.5)\n- Output inserter at (2.5, 1.5)\n\n3. Third column:\n- Furnace at (4.0, 0.0)\n- Input chest at (4.5, -2.5)\n- Output chest at (4.5, 2.5)\n- Input inserter at (4.5, -1.5)\n- Output inserter at (4.5, 1.5)\n\n4. Fourth column:\n- Furnace at (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chest at (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chest at (6.5, 2.5)\n- Input inserter at (6.5, -1.5)\n- Output inserter at (6.5, 1.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect belts directly to chests\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly to wooden chests\n- Use inserters to move items between chests and belts\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Mining drills are out of fuel - ensure coal is supplied to keep operations running\n- Several furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper material input flow\n- Multiple inserters waiting for source items - verify input supply chain is working correctly"}
