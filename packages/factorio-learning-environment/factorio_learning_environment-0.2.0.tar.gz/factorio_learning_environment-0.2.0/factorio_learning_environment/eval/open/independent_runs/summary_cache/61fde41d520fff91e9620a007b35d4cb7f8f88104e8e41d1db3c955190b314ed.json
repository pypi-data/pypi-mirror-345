{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area (Position 0,0 to 6,4)\nConsists of four stone furnaces:\n- Furnace 1 at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 3 at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace 4 at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are fueled with coal but currently have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Power Generation System (Position -9.5,24.5 to 4.5,24.5)\nSteam-based power generation setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected by two pipe networks:\n  - Water input pipes from pump to boiler\n  - Steam output pipes from boiler to steam engine\n- Small electric poles connecting the power network\n\n### Research Lab (Position ~10.5,0.5)\nSingle lab structure with:\n- Lab building containing 2 automation science packs\n- Connected to power network via electric poles\nCurrently working with power supply\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory requirement errors\n- Check if required items are in inventory before attempting to place structures\n- Craft required items before attempting to place entities like offshore pump, boiler etc.\n\n### Recipe chain errors\n- Some items like copper plates and iron plates cannot be crafted directly - they need furnace smelting\n- Raw resources like wood cannot be crafted and must be gathered from the environment\n\n### Power system errors\n- Ensure all components of power system (boiler, steam engine, electric poles) are properly connected\n- Keep boiler fueled to maintain power generation\n\n### Building placement errors\n- Verify building dimensions and space requirements before placement\n- Some buildings like offshore pumps have specific placement requirements (must be placed on water)\n\n### Programming/API errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations directly on Prototype attributes\n- Ensure proper type handling when working with building dimensions and calculations"}
