{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and depositing it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** used for storage:\n  - Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), and (x=8.5, y=-60.5) for general storage.\n  \n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with a current status of no ingredients to smelt but contains 5 iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with a current status of no ingredients to smelt but contains 65 iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with a current status of no ingredients to smelt but contains 98 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from stopping due to a full chest.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly supply the furnaces with iron ore to avoid them running out of ingredients and halting production.\n\n### Fuel Shortage for Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure there is a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel the burner mining drill and maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks items such as 'wooden-chest', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus - Monitors the status and warnings of the burner mining drill.\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus - Monitors the status and warnings of the furnaces."}
