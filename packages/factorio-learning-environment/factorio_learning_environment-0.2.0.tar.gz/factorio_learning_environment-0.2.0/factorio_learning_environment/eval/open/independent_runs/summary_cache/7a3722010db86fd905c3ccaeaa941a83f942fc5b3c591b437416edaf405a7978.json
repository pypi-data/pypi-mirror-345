{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position (117.5, -30.5)), boiler(position (111.5, -32.0)) and offshore pump(position (106.5, -32.5))\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) and a furnace at position(41.0, -80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position (39.5, -79.5)) that puts into furnace at position(41.0, -80.0)\n-  Belt group (position (39.5, -83.5)) that connects the furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) to burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n\n### Offshore pump system at position(105.5, -32.5)\nConsists of offshore pumps at positions (105.5, -32.5), (106.5, -32.5), (107.5, -34.5), (116.5, -54.5), (115.5, -51.5), (116.5, -53.5), (116.5, -49.5), (116.5, -47.5), (116.5, -45.5), (115.5, -43.5), (115.5, -41.5), (116.5, -40.5), (118.5, -40.5), (120.5, -40.5), (122.5, -39.5), (124.5, -39.5), (126.5, -37.5), (128.5, -35.5), (130.5, -33.5), (106.5, -29.5), (105.5, -27.5), (108.5, -28.5), (107.5, -26.5), (-9.5, 24.5) and pipes connecting them\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n-  Ensure the correct number of arguments are passed to the function. The function takes 3 positional arguments.\n-  Ensure that the positions passed to the function are integers, not floats.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n-  Ensure that the position where the entity is being placed is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors when using offshore pumps\n-  Ensure that the offshore pump is connected to a fluid system and has a fluid source.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   connect_entities: invoked multiple times with incorrect arguments, resulting in TypeError\n*   Important variables:\n    *   offshore_pump: Position object\n    *   boiler: Position object\n    *   Prototype.Pipe: string\n    *   water_pipes: undefined\n    *   fluid_system: integer\n    *   entity: object with position, direction, and other attributes"}
