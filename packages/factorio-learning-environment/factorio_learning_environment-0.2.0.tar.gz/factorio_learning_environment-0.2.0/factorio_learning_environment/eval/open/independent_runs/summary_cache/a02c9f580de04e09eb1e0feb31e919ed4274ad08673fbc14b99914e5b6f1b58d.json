{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15, -50) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14, -48) smelting iron plates\nCurrently working but output is blocked\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (0, 0)\n- Stone furnace at (2, 0)\nBoth furnaces currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (4, 4)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (4, 4) with 30 copper plates in output\n- Stone furnace at (6, 4) with 6 copper plates in output\nBoth furnaces currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around (-2, 23.5) to (9.5, 19.5), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2, 23.5)\n- Steam engine at (9.5, 19.5)\n- Two pipe networks connecting the components:\n  - Water pipe network from pump to boiler\n  - Steam pipe network from boiler to engine\n- Electric poles at (5.5, 13.5), (9.5, 17.5), and (2.5, 10.5)\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at (0.5, 8.5) connected to power network\n- Currently researching automation technology\n- Contains 7 automation science packs\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place structures\n- Check fuel (coal) levels before attempting to insert into machines\n- Verify ore availability before attempting to insert into furnaces\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Verify you have the required items in inventory before attempting to place entities like offshore pumps, boilers etc.\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Errors\n- Some items like copper plates and iron plates cannot be crafted directly - they need a furnace\n- Wood is a raw resource that must be gathered, it cannot be crafted\n\n### Programming/API Errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations on ModelPrivateAttr objects (WIDTH, HEIGHT) directly\n- Ensure you have required items in inventory before attempting to connect entities with pipes\n\n### Production Line Issues\n- Mining drill output is blocked - ensure there is a proper output connection (like a chest or belt) to prevent blockage"}
