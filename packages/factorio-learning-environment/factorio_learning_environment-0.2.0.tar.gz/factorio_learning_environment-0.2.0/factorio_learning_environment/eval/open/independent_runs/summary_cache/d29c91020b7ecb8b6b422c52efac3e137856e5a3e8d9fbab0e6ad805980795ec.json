The configuration remains unchanged.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup  \nPurpose: Facilitates extraction of iron ore and its conveyance to processing areas.  \nComponents: A burner\u2011mining drill paired with an adjacent wooden chest, multiple burner\u2011inserters along the mining site, and transport belts channeling the ore. This setup is consistent with previously established designs.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System  \nPurpose: Generates electrical power from steam energy.  \nComponents:  \n\u2013 A boiler positioned at (8.0, 20.5) with connection points approximately at (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5).  \n\u2013 Multiple steam engines installed at positions (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5), and (4.5, 23.5).  \nNote: An additional steam engine remains in inventory as it cannot be placed due to spatial congestion around the boiler zone.\n\n### Automation Research Lab  \nPurpose: Conducts technological research utilizing science packs.  \nComponents: A series of laboratory units that process automation science packs. Occasional power connectivity issues have been noted, but the lab network remains functionally intact.\n\n### Offshore Pump and Fluid Network  \nPurpose: Secures a steady water supply for fluid-dependent processes.  \nComponents: An offshore pump located at (0.5, 30.5) feeding into interconnected pipe groups that distribute water across the facility. No recent changes have been observed.\n\n### Electricity, Transport, and Fluid Infrastructure  \nPurpose: Provides the backbone for power distribution, material logistics, and fluid transport.  \nComponents: Integrated networks including electricity groups (arrays of power poles), belt groups interlinking production sites, and pipe groups dedicated to fluid management. The layout continues as previously established.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  \u2013 The extra steam engine remains unplaceable due to persistent spatial congestion in the boiler zone, mainly caused by overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts near positions (8.0, 20.5) and (8.5, 22.5).  \n  \u2013 Mitigation Strategies:  \n     \u2022 Remove or reposition conflicting entities (e.g., burner\u2011inserters and transport belts) around the boiler area to free up necessary build space.  \n     \u2022 Adjust the design of adjoining connection interfaces to provide sufficient clearance for additional steam engines.  \n     \u2022 Consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested region or redesigning the boiler zone layout to resolve the placement bottleneck."}
