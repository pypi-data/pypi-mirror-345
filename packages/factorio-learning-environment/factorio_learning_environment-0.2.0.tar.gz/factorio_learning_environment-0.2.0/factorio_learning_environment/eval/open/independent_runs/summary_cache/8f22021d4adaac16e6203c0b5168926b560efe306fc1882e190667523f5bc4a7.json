{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns correctly with the chest's position to avoid assertion errors. Verify that the inserter is positioned correctly before attempting to transfer items.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement\n- When placing entities like inserters, ensure there is no collision with existing entities or obstructions like water. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Maintain adequate inventory levels for essential items like coal to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and inserters. Regularly check inventory levels and replenish resources as needed to prevent operational interruptions."}
