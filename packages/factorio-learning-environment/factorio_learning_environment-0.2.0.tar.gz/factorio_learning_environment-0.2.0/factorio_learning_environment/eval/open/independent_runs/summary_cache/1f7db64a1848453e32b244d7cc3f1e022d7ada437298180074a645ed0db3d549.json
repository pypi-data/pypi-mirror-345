This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory items.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly check and empty chests to ensure they have space for new items. This will prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient fuel\n- Keep track of fuel levels in mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations. Regular refueling is essential for continuous operation."}
