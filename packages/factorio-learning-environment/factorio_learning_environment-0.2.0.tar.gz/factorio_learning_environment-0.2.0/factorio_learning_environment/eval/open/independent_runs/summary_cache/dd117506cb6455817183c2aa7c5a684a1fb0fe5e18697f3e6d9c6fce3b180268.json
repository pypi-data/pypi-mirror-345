{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0) and (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, with a current inventory of iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, with a current inventory of iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Collection and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0), fueled by coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) collecting mined resources from the burner mining drill.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (9.5, -60.5) used for distributing iron ore.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -50.5), currently empty.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing or direction if the position is already occupied.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place or use them. For example, ensure you have wooden chests in the inventory before attempting to place one.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing raw resources\n- Ensure that all required raw resources are gathered before attempting to craft complex items. For instance, gather sufficient stone before crafting stone furnaces, which are prerequisites for burner mining drills.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities without sufficient inventory\n- Check the inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into entities, such as ensuring coal is available before inserting into a burner mining drill.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `place_entity_next_to`: Attempts to place an entity next to a reference position. Failed when the target position was already occupied.\n  - `craft_item`: Crafts specified items. Failed due to missing raw resources required for crafting sub-ingredients.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_position: Position` - The position used as a reference for placing entities related to iron ore processing.\n  - `drill_drop_position: Position` - The position where mined resources are dropped by the burner mining drill.\n  - `num_drills: int` - The number of burner mining drills intended to be crafted."}
