{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) generating power.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) which requires refueling.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) supplying water.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=58268) at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) connecting various points.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=58279) at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) transporting water from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=164959) with poles at various positions including (x=10.5, y=13.5), (x=10.5, y=17.5), (x=26.5, y=17.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=-2.5, y=17.5), and (x=1.5, y=6.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected to both the boiler output and the steam engine input. Check the positions and directions of pipes to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors Due to Boiler Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the boiler to maintain continuous power generation. Monitor fuel levels and ensure a steady supply of fuel to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler via pipes. Ensure that the pipes are not blocked and that water is being transported efficiently from the offshore pump to the boiler and then to the steam engine."}
