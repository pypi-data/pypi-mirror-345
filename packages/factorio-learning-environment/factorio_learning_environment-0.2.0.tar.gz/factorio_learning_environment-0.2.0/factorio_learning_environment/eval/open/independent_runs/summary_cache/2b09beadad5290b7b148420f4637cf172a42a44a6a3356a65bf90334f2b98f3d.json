{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position: 16.0, 71.0)\n- Stone furnace (position: 17.0, 74.0)\n- Burner inserter (position: 18.5, 72.5) that outputs iron plates from furnace\n- Belt group (positions: 16.5, 72.5 to 18.5, 73.5) that connects the burner mining drill to the burner inserter\n- Wooden chest (position: 17.5, 77.5) that stores iron plates \n- Wooden chest (position: 18.5, 71.5) that catches iron plates \n\n### Copper Ore Mine at position(-46.5, 70.5)\nConsists of \n- Electric mining drill (not placed)\n- Electric furnace (position: 20.5, 70.5)\n- Boiler (position: 20.5, 68.0)\n\n### Electricity generator \nNo entities have been placed for electricity generation except for a boiler at position (20.5, 68.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of entities\n- Ensure that the entity's inventory is accessible and properly inspected.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect or missing attributes\n- Ensure that you are accessing valid attributes of an object. For example, 'BeltGroup' object has no attribute 'output_position'.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect or missing arguments\n- Verify that all required arguments are provided and correctly typed when calling a function or method, such as `inspect_inventory` requiring a valid entity.\n\n### Errors when extracting non-existent items from chests or furnaces\n- Ensure that the chest or furnace contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Check if the target position is occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Use an inserter as an intermediary when connecting transport belts to entities like furnaces.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with invalid paths\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with a transport belt are in a valid position and have a clear path.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to retrieve exists before attempting to access it.\n\n### Errors due to output being blocked\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like mining drills.\n\n### Errors when inserters cannot pickup or drop items\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to pickup and drop positions and that these positions are not occupied.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert non-existent items\n- Ensure that you have the item you are trying to insert in your inventory before attempting to insert it into an entity.\n\n### Errors due to unbound local variables\n- Ensure that all variables are properly defined and initialized before using them in your code.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items into a full inventory\n- Check if the target inventory is full before attempting to insert items into it.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources or machines\n- Ensure that you have the required resources and machines to craft the desired item.\n\n### Errors when placing steam engine without checking for valid positions\n- Ensure that the target position for the steam engine is valid and not occupied by another entity.\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
