{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nUse-case: Processes iron ore into iron plates. Recent operations now show that after inserting 10 iron ore, the furnace produced 6 iron plates following a waiting iteration; subsequently, 6 Iron Plates were extracted and the furnace was re-fed with freshly harvested iron ore from a located patch at (-15.5, -50.5). The internal operating updates indicate a transition from previous underproduction to a more stabilized production cycle.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient production output and delayed processing\n- Verify that the processing cycle receives adequate time to complete to meet production targets.\n- Adjust waiting periods or processing cycles to avoid timeouts when output production falls short.\n\n### Errors when inserting items despite resource unavailability\n- Confirm that inventory contains the intended resource prior to attempting insertion.\n- Double-check inventory levels to prevent errors arising from trying to insert a resource not present in the inventory."}
