{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources\n- The agent frequently encounters \"Not enough iron ore in inventory.\" and \"Not enough wooden chests in inventory.\" errors.\n    - Ensure sufficient resources are available before attempting crafting or building actions. Implement a system to check inventory levels before initiating these actions.\n\n### Inserter Placement Issues\n- The agent encounters issues with inserters being blocked by transport belts, specifically at (40.5, -80.5) being blocked by the transport belt at (39.5, -80.5), and inserters at (6.5, -57.5) and (8.5, -57.5) also being blocked.\n    - Before placing inserters and transport belts, verify that they do not obstruct each other's operation. Check the surrounding tiles for existing entities that might interfere with placement.\n\n### Harvesting Errors\n- The agent encounters \"Could not harvest wood: Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\".\n    - This error indicates a problem with the harvesting logic, possibly related to incorrect indexing or data types when determining the target wood entity. Review the harvesting function to ensure it correctly identifies and targets wood resources.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- The agent encounters \"The inserter already has fuel\" error.\n    - Before adding fuel to an inserter, check its current fuel level to avoid overfilling.\n\n### Transport Belt Issues\n- The agent encounters \"The transport belt is no longer there.\" error.\n    - This indicates that a transport belt that the agent was interacting with has been removed or destroyed. Before attempting to interact with a transport belt, verify that it still exists at the expected location.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n"}
