{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at the drop position.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n- Additional Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -52.5), (-2.5, -52.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), containing varying amounts of iron plates and iron ore.\n- Iron Chests at positions (-3.5, -52.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) with significant quantities of iron plates and iron ore.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt, but containing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, but no ingredients to smelt, containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from a full chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before attempting to extract items. Regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to allow continued mining operations.\n\n### Errors due to out of fuel in mining drills\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to ensure continuous operation. The drill at position (4.0, -60.0) needs refueling to resume mining activities.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the final inventory after step 2375, containing items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
