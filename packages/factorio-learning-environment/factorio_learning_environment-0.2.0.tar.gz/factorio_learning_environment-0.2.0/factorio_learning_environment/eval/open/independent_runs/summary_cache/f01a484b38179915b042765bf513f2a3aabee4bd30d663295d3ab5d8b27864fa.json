{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest and other entities\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) storing copper ore\n- Additional Transport Belts forming a network for material movement\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) moving items into the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the chest\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\n- Transport Belts moving iron ore to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) facilitating ore movement\n\n### Centralized Storage and Processing Hub at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=3.5, y=0.5) for storing various materials\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) managing material transfer between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. This can be achieved by checking the tile's occupancy status prior to placement.\n\n### Attribute Errors when accessing non-existent attributes\n- Verify that the object in use supports the attributes being accessed. For example, ensure that the object is of the correct type before attempting to access its attributes."}
