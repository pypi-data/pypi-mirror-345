{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Mines\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with iron plates and no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with iron plates and no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with iron plates and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (35.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (35.5, 23.5), not connected to the power network, with no input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5), not connected, with no fluid present in connections.\n- Multiple PipeGroups connecting the offshore pump to the steam engine, but currently empty.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (8.5, -0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (17.5, -0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (19.5, -0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (20.5, -0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (8.5, 1.5) containing iron ore.\n\n### Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5), waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5), waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (19.5, 0.5), waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (20.5, 0.5), waiting for source items.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science packs, but no power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure that copper plates are available in the inventory or smelted in a furnace to craft copper cables, which are required for crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Steam Engine to Power Network\n- Verify that you have the required items, such as small electric poles, in your inventory before attempting to connect the steam engine to the power network.\n\n### Offshore Pump and Steam Engine Not Working\n- Investigate the connections between the offshore pump and the steam engine to ensure there are no blockages or missing connections. Ensure that the offshore pump is correctly positioned and connected to the water source.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Before placing entities like boilers or pipes, ensure that the target location is clear of other objects to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors in Extracting from Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces contain the expected items before attempting extraction. Verify the status of the furnace and its contents.\n\n### Errors in Code Execution\n- Review the code logic and ensure that entity retrieval functions are correctly implemented, especially when fetching entities like boilers at specific positions."}
