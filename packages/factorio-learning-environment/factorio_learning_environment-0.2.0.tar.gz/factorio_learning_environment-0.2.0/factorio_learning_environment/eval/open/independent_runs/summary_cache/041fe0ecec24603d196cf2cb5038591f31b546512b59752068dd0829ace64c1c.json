{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED, warnings about no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status FULL_OUTPUT, connected to the steam engine via a series of pipes.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING, providing water to the boiler through a connected pipe network.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (x=9.5, y=15.5) with status EMPTY, part of the fluid system 30826.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=21.5) with status EMPTY, part of the fluid system 30834.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=23.5) with status WORKING, part of the fluid system 30836, carrying water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with id 54781, consisting of multiple poles at positions such as (x=10.5, y=17.5), (x=10.5, y=13.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), and others, but currently with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages before attempting to reconnect pipes. Check for obstacles in the path of the pipe connection.\n\n### Errors when Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Verify that there is a suitable position available for placing electric poles. Clear any obstructions or choose a different location.\n\n### Errors with Entity Position Arguments\n- When using functions that require position arguments, ensure the second argument is a Position object to avoid ValueError.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler_fluid_systems`: List[int] = [30679, 30783, 30852]\n- `steam_engine_fluid_systems`: Dict = {}\n- `steam_engine_status`: EntityStatus = EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] = {'wooden-chest': 11, 'burner-inserter': 5, 'small-electric-pole': 2, 'pipe': 225, 'pipe-to-ground': 8, 'boiler': 1, 'burner-mining-drill': 3, 'offshore-pump': 2, 'stone-furnace': 4, 'lab': 1, 'wood': 3, 'coal': 160, 'stone': 20, 'iron-ore': 169, 'copper-ore': 42, 'iron-plate': 2011, 'copper-cable': 8, 'electronic-circuit': 4}"}
