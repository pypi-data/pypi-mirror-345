{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of 4 stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) \n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Research Lab Setup\nLab at position (10.5, 0.5) with:\n- 2 automation science packs loaded\n- Connected to power network\n- Currently working on automation research\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-2.5, 24.0), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) \n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipe network between components\n- Small electric poles connecting power to lab\nSystem is operational with water flowing through pipes\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with crafting items requiring assembling machines/furnaces\n- Items like copper plates, iron plates cannot be crafted directly - they require smelting in furnaces\n- Set up dedicated furnaces for different plate types\n\n### Errors with missing ingredients\n- Ensure you have all required raw materials before attempting to craft complex items\n- Wood needs to be gathered, cannot be crafted\n- Coal needs to be in inventory before trying to fuel furnaces\n\n### Errors with placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required entity in inventory before trying to place it\n- Check recipe requirements and craft necessary items first\n\n### Errors with connecting entities\n- Have required connection items (like pipes) in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Ensure entities are within connection range\n\n### Programming errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations on model attributes directly\n- Use proper attribute access methods instead"}
