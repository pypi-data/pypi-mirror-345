To avoid this, always route the belt connection through an intermediary inserter that can input items into the steam engine rather than connecting directly to it.\n\u2022 Wooden Chest Placement Failures \u2013 Placement errors occurred when the chest was targeted too far from the player and when the chest was missing from inventory. Ensure you are within the maximum allowed placement distance and verify that the required wooden chest is available before attempting placement.\n\u2022 Undefined Target Variable \u2013 A NameError was triggered due to referencing \u201ctarget_chest\u201d instead of one of the defined target identifiers. Double-check variable names and use the correct reference (such as target_pos, target_place_pos, or depot_chest) to avoid such errors."}
