## Installation

You can install `napari-adaptive-painting` via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install napari-adaptive-painting

## Usage

- Select the plugin from the `Plugins` menu of Napari.
- Open an image to annotate (2D+t or 3D).
- Open, load, or create a `Labels` layer for annotating objects.
- Select the instance label to adaptively paint from the layer controls (tip: use the `Pick mode` to quickly select labels) or draw a new one (in the visible 2D plane).
- Click on *Start*.
- Move along the Z axis (which can also represent time). Whenever the Z plane changes, the label mask is adapted to match the new Z plane.

**Known limitations**

- The plugin won't work if the layers are transposed. Stick to the original layer orientation.
