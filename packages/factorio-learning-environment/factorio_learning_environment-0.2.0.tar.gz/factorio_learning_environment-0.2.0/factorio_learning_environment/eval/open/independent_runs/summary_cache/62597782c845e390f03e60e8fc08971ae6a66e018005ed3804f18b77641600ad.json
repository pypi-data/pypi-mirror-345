For example, crafting iron-gear-wheel requires iron-plate, which cannot be crafted if you do not have a furnace or crafting machine available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
