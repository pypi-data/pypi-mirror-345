{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with current fuel: 8 coal, output: 15 iron plates\n- Furnace (position (2.0, 0.0)) with current fuel: 8 coal, output: 14 iron plates\n- Furnace (position (4.0, 0.0)) with current fuel: 3 coal, output: 15 iron plates\n- Furnace (position (6.0, 0.0)) with no fuel or ingredients\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nThis structure consists of three stone furnaces that are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. The furnaces are connected by a system of inserters that transfer iron ore and coal into the furnaces for processing.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to craft without sufficient resources\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, not having enough iron plates resulted in failed attempts to craft additional stone furnaces.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces. Errors occurred when trying to insert iron ore and coal when there were none available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Verify that the tile is free before placing a new entity. Errors occurred when attempting to place a new stone furnace in a location that was already occupied.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces that are out of fuel or ingredients\n- Check the fuel and ingredient status of your furnaces before attempting to insert items. Some furnaces were reported as having no fuel or ingredients, leading to errors in processing."}
