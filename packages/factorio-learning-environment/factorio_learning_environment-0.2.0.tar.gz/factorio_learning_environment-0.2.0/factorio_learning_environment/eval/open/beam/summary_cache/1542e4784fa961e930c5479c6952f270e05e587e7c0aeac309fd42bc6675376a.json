{"content": "The error indicates that we still don't have enough small electric poles to connect the assembling machines to the power network. Let's address this by crafting more poles and ensuring we have enough resources.\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Issue:\n\n1. **Assess Inventory for Required Materials:**\n   - **Wood:** Needed for crafting poles.\n   - **Copper Cables:** Crafted from copper plates.\n\n2. **Gather Additional Resources:**\n   - **Wood:** Ensure you have enough wood for crafting additional poles. Move to the nearest wood resource and gather more if necessary.\n   - **Copper Plates:** Ensure you have enough copper plates to craft the required copper cables.\n\n3. **Craft Copper Cables:**\n   - Craft the necessary amount of copper cables if you have sufficient copper plates.\n\n4. **Craft Additional Small Electric Poles:**\n   - Craft more small electric poles to meet the connection requirements.\n\n5. **Connect Assembling Machines to Power:**\n   - Once you have enough poles, attempt to connect the assembling machines to the power network again.\n\n### Updated Code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Gather Additional Resources\nwood_needed = 6  # Assuming we need more poles\nmove_to(nearest(Resource.Wood))\nharvested_wood = harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Wood), quantity=wood_needed)\nassert harvested_wood > 0, \"Failed to gather enough wood.\"\n\n# Check copper plates and craft copper cables\ncopper_plates_needed = 12  # For 6 poles, need 12 cables\ncopper_plates_in_inventory = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\nif copper_plates_in_inventory >= copper_plates_needed:\n    craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, quantity=6)\n\n# Step 2: Craft Additional Small Electric Poles\ncrafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, quantity=6)\nassert crafted_poles > 0, \"Could not craft enough small electric poles.\"\n\n# Step 3: Connect Assembling Machines to Power\nfor assembly in assemblies:\n    for pole in poles:\n        connect_entities(assembly, pole, connection_type=Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\n\n# Step 4: Reassess Power Status and Retry Gear Wheel Production\nentities_on_map_recheck = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after additional pole crafting: {entities_on_map_recheck}\")\n\n# Retry crafting gear wheels\nif current_iron_plates >= 5:\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronPlate, assemblies[0], quantity=5)\n    sleep(10)\n    post_power_gear_wheel_inventory = inspect_inventory(assemblies[0])\n    newly_produced_gear_wheels = post_power_gear_wheel_inventory.get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0)\n    if newly_produced_gear_wheels > 0:\n        extract_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, assemblies[0].position, newly_produced_gear_wheels)\n\n# Step 5: Final Verification for Steam Engine Crafting\ngear_wheels = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0)\ncurrent_iron_plates = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\n\nif gear_wheels >= 5 and (current_iron_plates - 5) >= 10:\n    final_craft_attempt = craft_item(Prototype.SteamEngine)\n    assert final_craft_attempt > 0, \"Steam Engine crafting failed; ensure power and resources are aligned.\"\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- **Resource Management:** Always ensure you have sufficient resources before attempting to craft items.\n- **Inventory Checks:** Regularly check your inventory to confirm you have the necessary materials.\n- **Power Connectivity:** Ensure all machines are connected to the power network before attempting production tasks.", "summary_range": "[1-234]"}
