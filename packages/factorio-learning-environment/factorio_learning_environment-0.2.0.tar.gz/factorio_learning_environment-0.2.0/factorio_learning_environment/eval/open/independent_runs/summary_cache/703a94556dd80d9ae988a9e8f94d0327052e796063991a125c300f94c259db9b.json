{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Refueled multiple times and actively extracting iron ore.\n  - Connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5) for ore storage.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Currently has no ingredients to smelt and contains iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Ensure there is enough space and the correct orientation when placing a Burner Inserter next to other entities like chests and furnaces. Adjust the position if the placement fails.\n\n### Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables, such as `chest_inserter`, are defined before use. Double-check for typos or incorrect variable names.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- When connecting entities with belts, ensure that inserters are used to transfer items from storage entities like chests. Direct connections from chests to belts are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Warnings about full storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage."}
