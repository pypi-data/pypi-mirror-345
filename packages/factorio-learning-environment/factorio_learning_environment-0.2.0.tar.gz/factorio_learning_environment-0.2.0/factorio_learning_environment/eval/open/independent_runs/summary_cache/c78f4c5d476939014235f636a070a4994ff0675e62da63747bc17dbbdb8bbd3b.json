{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Collection System at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-16.5, -51.5) transferring items from the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5) transferring items to the wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) for temporary storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -51.5) for collecting iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Furnace System at position(62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (63.5, -52.5) transferring items to/from the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where obstructions exist\n- Ensure the target location is clear of any obstructions before attempting to place an entity. If an obstruction is detected, clear it first before placement.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without inventory\n- Verify that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. Craft or acquire the entity if it is not available.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Check for existing entities that may occupy the space.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients for production\n- Ensure that the necessary ingredients are available for the production process in entities like furnaces. Check inventories and supply chains to ensure all required materials are present."}
