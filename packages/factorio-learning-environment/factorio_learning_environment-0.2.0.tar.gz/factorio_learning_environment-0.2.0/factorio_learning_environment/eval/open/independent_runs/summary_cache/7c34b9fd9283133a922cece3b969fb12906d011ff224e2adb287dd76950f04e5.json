{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the steam engine, starting from position (-47.5, -122.5) to (-40.5, -116.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Small Electric Pole at position (5.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at (6.5, -59.5) for storing iron plates and other materials\n\n### Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5)\n- Lab with input for automation science packs but currently not powered\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting to Power Network\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network. Craft or gather necessary items such as Small Electric Poles.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- When accessing attributes of objects, ensure the object type supports the attribute. For example, 'Generator' objects do not have a 'fuel' attribute. Verify object properties before accessing them.\n\n### Errors When Retrieving Entities\n- Confirm the existence and correct positioning of entities before attempting to retrieve them. Use accurate coordinates and ensure the entity type matches the expected prototype.\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Ensure that all components requiring power are properly connected to the power network. Verify that electric poles are correctly placed and connected to the power grid."}
