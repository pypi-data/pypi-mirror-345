{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) transferring items between the drill, chest, and furnace.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) storing iron ore from the drill.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) storing additional iron ore.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting from empty chests\n- The agent repeatedly attempted to extract iron ore from chests that were empty. Ensure the chest has sufficient items before attempting extraction.\n\n#### Inefficient furnace usage\n- The furnace at (x=6.0, y=-63.0) is idle due to lack of ingredients. Ensure furnaces are supplied with sufficient raw materials to maintain production.\n\n#### Over-extraction from chests\n- The agent extracted large quantities of iron ore (e.g., 800 iron ore) from a chest, which may lead to inefficiencies. Monitor inventory levels and extract only what is needed for immediate use.\n\n#### Warnings from burner inserter\n- The burner inserter at (x=3.5, y=-61.5) is waiting for source items. Ensure the inserter has a steady supply of items to transfer to avoid delays in production.\n\n#### Idle furnaces\n- Furnaces should always have a supply of fuel and raw materials. Regularly check furnaces to ensure they are operational and not idle due to lack of resources."}
