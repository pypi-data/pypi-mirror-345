{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently working with fuel: coal.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5), storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5), extracting items from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** system connecting the wooden chest to the second burner inserter and further to the third burner inserter.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5), transferring items from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5), collecting iron plates from the belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied\n- Ensure there is enough space for placing entities. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or reference position to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to a belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. Gather necessary resources beforehand.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing raw resources\n- Gather raw resources like wood manually as they cannot be crafted. Ensure you have all sub-ingredients available before crafting complex items."}
