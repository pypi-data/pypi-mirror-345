{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report: Steps 0-31\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Setup (Water -> Steam -> Power)\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) extracts water. Status: `EntityStatus.WORKING`.\n*   **Boiler** at position (x=-2.0, y=4.5) heats water using coal. Status: `EntityStatus.NO_FUEL` (Warning: out of fuel).\n*   **Steam Engine** at position (x=2.5, y=4.5) consumes steam to generate power. Status: `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED` (Warnings: not connected to power network, no input liquid, no fluid present in connections).\n*   **Pipe Network 1** (Fluid: water, System ID: 14051) connects the Offshore Pump to the Boiler. Consists of multiple pipes including segments near (x=-8.5, y=-0.5) and (x=-2.5, y=2.5). Status: `EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT`.\n*   **Pipe Network 2** (Fluid: steam, System ID: 14056) connects the Boiler output to the Steam Engine input. Consists of multiple pipes including segments near (x=-0.5, y=4.5) and (x=0.5, y=2.5). Status: `EntityStatus.EMPTY`.\n*   **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=6.5) is intended to fuel the Boiler from a belt at (x=-1.5, y=7.5). Status: `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`.\n*   **Electricity Group** (ID 126592) distributes power from the Steam Engine via Small Electric Poles, connecting various structures including the Iron Ore mine. Voltage: 0 (No power generation).\n\n### Automated Coal Mining and Delivery\n*   **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) mines coal. Status: `EntityStatus.WORKING`.\n*   **Wooden Chest** at position (x=16.5, y=1.5) receives coal from the drill. Contains coal.\n*   **"}
