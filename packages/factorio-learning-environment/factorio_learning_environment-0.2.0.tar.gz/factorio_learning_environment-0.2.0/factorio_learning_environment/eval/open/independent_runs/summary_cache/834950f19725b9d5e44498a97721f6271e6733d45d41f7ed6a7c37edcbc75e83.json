{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- Iron Chest at position (-16.5, -48.5) and (-18.5, -48.5) for additional storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -49.5) for storing processed materials.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -78.5) for transferring materials.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) and (-9.0, -48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for processing coal.\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) for transferring materials.\n- Additional Iron Chests at positions (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional coal storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting from Chests\n- Ensure that the chests are not full and have available space before attempting to extract items. This will prevent extraction failures.\n\n### Errors in Supplying Iron Ore to Furnaces\n- Verify that there is sufficient iron ore in the inventory before attempting to supply it to furnaces. This will avoid insertion failures due to lack of materials.\n\n### Errors in Clearing Chests\n- Make sure the agent is positioned correctly and the chest is not full before attempting to clear it. This will prevent extraction errors.\n\n### Errors in Refueling Furnaces\n- Ensure that there is enough fuel in the inventory before attempting to refuel furnaces to avoid refueling failures."}
