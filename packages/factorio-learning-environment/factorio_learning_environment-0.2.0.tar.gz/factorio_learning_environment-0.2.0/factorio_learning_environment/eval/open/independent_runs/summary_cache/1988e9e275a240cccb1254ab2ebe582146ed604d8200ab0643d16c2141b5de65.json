{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=52.5, y=-84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and another at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0).\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) and another at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) and another at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5).\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill, furnaces, and chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transferring items to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the transport belts are correctly aligned and positioned to connect entities. Verify that the starting and ending positions are valid and within reach.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of storage space.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. Check that the source entities are correctly positioned and stocked with items for the inserters to pick up.\n\n### Errors with Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that there is a steady supply of fuel available."}
