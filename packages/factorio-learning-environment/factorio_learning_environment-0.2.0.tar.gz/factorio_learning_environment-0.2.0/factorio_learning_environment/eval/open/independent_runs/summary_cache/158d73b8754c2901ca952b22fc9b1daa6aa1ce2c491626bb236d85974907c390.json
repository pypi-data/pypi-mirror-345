This indicates that the chosen locations are consistently unsuitable for building, possibly due to terrain, existing structures, or other unremovable obstacles.\n- Before attempting to place a lab, ensure the target location is clear of obstructions, including trees, rocks, and other entities.\n- Choose a location that is known to be buildable, such as near existing structures or resource patches.\n- Consider implementing a function to scan the area for obstructions before attempting to place the lab.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n```"}
