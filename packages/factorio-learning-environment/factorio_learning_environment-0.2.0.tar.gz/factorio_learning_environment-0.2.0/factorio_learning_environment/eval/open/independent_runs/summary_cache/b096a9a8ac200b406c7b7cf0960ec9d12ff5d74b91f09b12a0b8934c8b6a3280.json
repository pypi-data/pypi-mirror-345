For example, use 'entities.BurnerInserter' instead of 'BurnerInserter' to avoid NameError.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters are correctly positioned and have access to source items. Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities.\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Entity References\n- Double-check the spelling and case sensitivity of entity references in the code to prevent NameErrors. Use the correct module and class names as defined in the game's API."}
