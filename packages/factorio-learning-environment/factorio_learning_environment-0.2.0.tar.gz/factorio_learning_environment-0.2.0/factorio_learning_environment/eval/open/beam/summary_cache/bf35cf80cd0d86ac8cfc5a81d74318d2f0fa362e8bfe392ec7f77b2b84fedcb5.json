{"content": "The furnace is currently in a `FULL_OUTPUT` status, which means its output slot is full and needs to be cleared before it can continue processing copper ore into copper plates. Here's how we can resolve this:\n\n1. **Extract the Iron Plate**: The furnace's output slot is occupied by an iron plate. We need to remove it to allow further processing of copper ore.\n\n2. **Reinsert Copper Ore if Necessary**: Once the output slot is cleared, ensure the furnace continues processing copper ore.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Extract the iron plate from the furnace\niron_plate_extracted = extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace_entity.position, 1)\nprint(f\"Extracted iron plate: {iron_plate_extracted}\")\n\n# Step 2: Recheck the furnace inventory to ensure it can continue processing\nfurnace_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(\"Furnace inventory after extraction: \", furnace_inventory_after_extraction)\n\n# Step 3: Allow time for the furnace to process the copper ore\nsleep(10)\n\n# Step 4: Verify the furnace has processed copper into copper plates\nfurnace_inventory_after_processing = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(\"Furnace inventory after processing copper: \", furnace_inventory_after_processing)\n\n# Step 5: Extract copper plates if available\ncopper_plates = furnace_inventory_after_processing.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\nif copper_plates > 0:\n    extracted_copper_plates = extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, furnace_entity.position, copper_plates)\n    print(\"Extracted copper plates: \", extracted_copper_plates)\nelse:\n    print(\"No copper plates available yet. Ensure the furnace is processing correctly.\")\n```\n\nThis approach should help clear the output slot and allow the furnace to continue processing copper ore into copper plates. Once you have copper plates, you can proceed to craft copper cables and then the small electric pole.", "summary_range": "[1-124]"}
