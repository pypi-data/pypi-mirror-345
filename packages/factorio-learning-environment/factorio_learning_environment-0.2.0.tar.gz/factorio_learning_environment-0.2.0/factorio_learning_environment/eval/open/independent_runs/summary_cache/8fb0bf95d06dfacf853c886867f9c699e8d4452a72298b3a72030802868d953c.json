{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore and smelt it into iron plates.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=28.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=28.0, y=86.0)\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=30.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=30.0, y=86.0)\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=32.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=32.0, y=86.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Fueling Failures and Logic Errors\n*   The agent continues to fail to fuel existing burner mining drills and stone furnaces (Steps 32-63, 64-71). Logs consistently show `Successfully handled 0 entities. Fueled 0 entities.` despite identifying 6 entities needing fuel.\n*   Multiple assertion errors related to fueling logic persist:\n    *   **Entity Count Mismatch:** (Steps 40-67, 69-70) `AssertionError: Logic error: Entity count mismatch. Handled: 0, Failed: 0, Total Found: 6`. This indicates a fundamental flaw where the fueling logic does not process all identified entities. Review the loop or function responsible for iterating through and fueling entities to ensure it correctly handles every entity found.\n    *   **Failure to Process/Fuel:** (Step 68) `AssertionError: Failed to process or fuel entities at: [list of positions]`. This occurred after the loop iterated through each entity but encountered an internal `AssertionError()` for each one, preventing successful fueling. This suggests an issue within the per-entity fueling logic itself.\n*   Even simplified fueling attempts (Steps 69, 70, 71) failed to fuel any entities, indicating the core problem in identifying which entities need fuel or executing the `insert_item` action remains unresolved. Step 71 completed without errors but still fueled 0 entities."}
