{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for electricity distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) and another at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (5.0, 5.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserters and Small Electric Poles for material handling and power supply\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for storing mined iron ore\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) for moving items between chests\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Accessing BeltGroup Attributes\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup object has the correct attributes before accessing them. The 'direction' attribute does not exist for BeltGroup. Consider checking the documentation or the object definition to understand the available attributes.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters have a power supply and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Inserters must be connected to a power source and have a clear path to their source and destination entities.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a power source. Use small electric poles to extend the power network to all necessary entities.\n\n### Errors with Resource Supply\n- Ensure that all production entities have the required resources. For example, the assembling machine requires copper plates to produce copper cables. Make sure the supply chain is complete and functioning."}
