{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is currently working and fueled with coal. It is connected to a wooden chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) which is full, preventing further mining.\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions (e.g., (5.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), etc.) storing iron plates and iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt and full furnace results containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Operations\n- Ensure that there is enough coal or other fuel types available in the inventory to refuel drills and furnaces to maintain continuous operations.\n\n### Full Storage Containers\n- Regularly check and empty storage containers such as chests to prevent production halts due to full inventories. For instance, the chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) is full, stopping the mining drill from depositing more iron ore.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Currently, the stone furnaces are not operational due to a lack of ingredients, and their results are full.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: Integer, used as fuel in mining drills and furnaces.\n  - `iron-ore`: Integer, raw material mined and stored.\n  - `iron-plate`: Integer, processed material stored in chests.\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: Integer, crafted item in inventory."}
