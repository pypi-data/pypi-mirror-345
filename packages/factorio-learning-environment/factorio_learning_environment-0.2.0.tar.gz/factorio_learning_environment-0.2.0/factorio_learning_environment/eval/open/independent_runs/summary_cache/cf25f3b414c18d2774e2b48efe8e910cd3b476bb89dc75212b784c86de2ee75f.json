{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -48.5) transferring items from the mining drill to the chest\n- Stone Furnace at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Additional Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -49.5) and (-9.5, -49.5) for storage\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5) for storing processed materials\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-14.5, -46.5) and (-14.5, -45.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for processing materials\n- Burner Inserters at positions (40.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (43.5, -80.5), and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring coal and other materials\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional coal storage\n- Additional Iron Chest at position (45.5, -80.5) for storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Ensure all variables and entities are correctly defined before using them in operations. For example, ensure 'extra_coal_storage' is defined before attempting to use it.\n\n### Errors due to Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full drop positions.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and other processing entities have the necessary ingredients to operate. Regularly supply them with required materials to avoid production halts."}
