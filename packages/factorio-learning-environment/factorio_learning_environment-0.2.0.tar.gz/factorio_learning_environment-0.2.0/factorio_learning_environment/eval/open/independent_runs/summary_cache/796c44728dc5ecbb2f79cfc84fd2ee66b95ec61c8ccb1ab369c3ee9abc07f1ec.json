{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which is extracting iron ore. It is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled by coal and has a warning that the fuel source is full.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which is waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., wooden chest) exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract from it. This will prevent errors like \"Could not find a valid wooden-chest entity containing iron-ore.\"\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent warnings and ensure continuous operation of mining drills and inserters. For example, the chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) should be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Errors due to full fuel source\n- Monitor the fuel levels in furnaces and other entities to avoid the \"furnace fuel source is full\" warning. This ensures that the furnace can continue operating efficiently."}
