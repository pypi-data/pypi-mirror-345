{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It requires coal as fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Operation\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning indicates potential misalignment.\n- Verify that the inserter is adequately fueled with coal to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory to refuel the inserter and mining drill. Lack of coal can halt operations.\n\n### Errors in Crafting\n- Avoid attempting to craft raw resources like coal, as they cannot be crafted and must be gathered directly from the environment.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore to the furnace. The furnace requires iron ore to operate and produce iron plates.\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent it from becoming full, which would stop the mining drill from depositing more iron ore."}
