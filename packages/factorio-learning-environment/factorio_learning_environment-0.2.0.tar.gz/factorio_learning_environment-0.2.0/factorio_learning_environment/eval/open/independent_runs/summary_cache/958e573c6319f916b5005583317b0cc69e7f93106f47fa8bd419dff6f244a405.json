{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (-39.5, -116.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) and powered by Small Electric Poles at positions (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5)\n\n### Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located at an unspecified position, currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions, all currently empty:\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 10.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-5.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of an ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, currently not providing power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that pipes are placed correctly and are present at the specified positions before attempting to connect them. Verify the placement at positions such as (-47.5, -122.5), (-47.5, -121.5), and (-46.5, -121.0).\n\n### Boiler Connection Errors\n- Make sure the boiler is connected to a water source. Check the connections between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure they are properly linked.\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Verify that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a functioning power network. Ensure small electric poles are correctly placed to provide power to all necessary components.\n\n### Ingredient Supply for Furnaces\n- Ensure that all furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply of raw materials to the furnaces at positions like (-19.0, -73.0) and (9.0, -64.0) to prevent production halts."}
