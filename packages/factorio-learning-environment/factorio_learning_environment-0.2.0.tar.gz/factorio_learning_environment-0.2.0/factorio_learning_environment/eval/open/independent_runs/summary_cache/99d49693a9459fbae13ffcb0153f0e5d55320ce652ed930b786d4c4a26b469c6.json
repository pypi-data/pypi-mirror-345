Regularly verify the setup to prevent interruptions in the production line.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of all entities, especially inserters and drills, to ensure continuous operation. Refuel them promptly to avoid disruptions.\n\n### Errors When Attempting to Insert Items Without Inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent errors related to missing items."}
