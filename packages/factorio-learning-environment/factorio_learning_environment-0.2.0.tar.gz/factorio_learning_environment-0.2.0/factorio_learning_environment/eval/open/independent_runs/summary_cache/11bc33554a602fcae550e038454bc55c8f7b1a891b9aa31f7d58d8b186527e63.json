{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal and depositing into:\n- Two Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transportation System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for temporary storage of copper ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest, facilitating ore movement.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between chests.\n- Transport Belt network for moving iron ore to the processing area.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items and that the destination is not full. Check for warnings like \"inserter waiting for source items\" and \"chest is full\" to troubleshoot inserter issues.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Address warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt\" by supplying the required resources to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement and Connectivity\n- Verify that all entities are correctly placed and connected to their intended neighbors. Ensure that transport belts and inserters are aligned properly to maintain efficient resource flow."}
