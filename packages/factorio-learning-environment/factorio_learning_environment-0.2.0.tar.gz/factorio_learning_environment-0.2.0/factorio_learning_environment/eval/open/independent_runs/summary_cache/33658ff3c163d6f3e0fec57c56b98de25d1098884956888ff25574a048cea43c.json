{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5), not connected to the power network.\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0), operational with coal as fuel.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5), operational and supplying water.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the boiler to the steam engine, facilitating steam transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variables in Code\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. For example, `steam_engine_buildable_area` was not defined before being used.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- Avoid using incompatible types in calculations, such as adding `ModelPrivateAttr` and `int`. Ensure all operands are compatible.\n\n### Inventory Management for Crafting\n- Ensure all required items are in inventory before attempting to craft. For instance, crafting a steam engine failed due to missing `iron-plate` and `iron-gear-wheel`.\n\n### Crafting Sub-Ingredients\n- Verify that all sub-ingredients can be crafted or are available. For example, crafting `iron-gear-wheel` failed due to missing `iron-plate`.\n\n### Placing Entities without Inventory\n- Verify that the necessary items are in inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, placing a steam engine failed due to lack of inventory.\n\n### Connecting Entities without Required Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in inventory before attempting to connect entities, such as pipes for connecting a boiler to a steam engine.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of fuel (e.g., coal) to keep structures operational. For example, inserting coal into the boiler failed due to lack of coal in inventory."}
