{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\nThis structure is designed to transfer iron ore from a chest to a furnace. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a connected chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to a furnace. It is refueled with coal and is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns correctly with the chest's position. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring items.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the intended target, such as a furnace, to ensure smooth transfer of items.\n\n### Placement Errors with Inserters\n- When placing an inserter, ensure there is no collision with existing entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts with nearby entities like mining drills or chests.\n\n### Fueling Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills or inserters. Lack of fuel can halt operations.\n\n### Resource Transfer Issues\n- Regularly check the setup of inserters and ensure they are properly configured to transfer resources between entities. Misconfigured inserters can lead to resource bottlenecks.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency of resource transfer and processing can be significantly improved."}
