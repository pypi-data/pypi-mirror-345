{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport belt at position (21.5, 73.5) carrying iron plates away from the chest.\n\nThis structure forms a connected iron plate production line from ore extraction to plate output onto a belt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel management for burner inserters and machines\n- Always ensure sufficient coal is available in inventory before attempting to insert fuel into burner inserters or furnaces. Multiple errors occurred due to \"No coal in inventory\" when fueling the burner inserter at (19.5, 73.5).\n- Regularly harvest and stockpile coal to prevent fuel shortages that cause machines and inserters to stop working.\n- Insert coal into all fuel-consuming entities (drill, furnace, inserters, belt inserters) proactively to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Item insertion failures due to empty inventory\n- Attempts to insert coal into entities failed multiple times because the inventory was empty at the time of insertion commands. Check inventory contents before insertion to avoid exceptions.\n- Implement inventory checks or wait until sufficient items are harvested before issuing insert commands.\n\n### Inserter blocking and waiting states\n- Inserters often entered WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS or WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION states, indicating upstream or downstream blockages.\n- Ensure the furnace has iron ore to process and the chest or belt has capacity to receive iron plates to avoid inserter blockage.\n- The burner inserter at (16.5, 74.5) showed warnings about output blocked by items on the ground due to no sink entity accepting output. Confirm belt or chest connections are properly aligned and functional.\n\n### Placement order and spacing considerations\n- Initial failure placing the transport belt near the chest and inserters was resolved by adjusting spacing to position (21.5, 73.5).\n- Plan entity placement order and spacing carefully to avoid tile occupation conflicts.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
