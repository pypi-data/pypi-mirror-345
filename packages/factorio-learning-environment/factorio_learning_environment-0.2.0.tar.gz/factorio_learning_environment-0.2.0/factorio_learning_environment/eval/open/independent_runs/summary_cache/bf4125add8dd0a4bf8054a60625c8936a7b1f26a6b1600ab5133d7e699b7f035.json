{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5), and (8.5, y=-60.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, y=-58.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) with varying amounts of coal and iron ore. The furnace at (-11.0, y=-48.0) has a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-4.5, y=-52.5), (-5.5, y=-52.5), (-2.5, y=-52.5), (-14.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), (-12.5, y=-50.5), (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), (-8.5, y=-50.5), (-7.5, y=-50.5), (-6.5, y=-50.5) storing various amounts of iron plates and iron ore.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-3.5, y=-52.5) and (-6.5, y=-50.5) storing iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from full chests\n- Ensure that the chest is not full before attempting to extract items. If the chest is full, empty it first to continue operations.\n\n### Errors when refueling without coal\n- Maintain a sufficient amount of coal in the inventory to refuel burner mining drills. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies.\n\n### Errors when attempting to harvest with a full inventory\n- Make sure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to harvest resources. Transfer or use items to free up space if necessary.\n\n### Errors when extracting from furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace has finished processing and has items ready for extraction before attempting to extract. If extraction fails, verify the furnace status and inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **harvest_resource(coal_position: Position, quantity: int) -> None**: Attempts to harvest a specified quantity of coal from a given position. Ensure the inventory is not full before calling this function to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **harvested_coal**: int - Stores the quantity of coal harvested.\n- **inventory**: dict - Represents the current inventory with item names as keys and quantities as values."}
