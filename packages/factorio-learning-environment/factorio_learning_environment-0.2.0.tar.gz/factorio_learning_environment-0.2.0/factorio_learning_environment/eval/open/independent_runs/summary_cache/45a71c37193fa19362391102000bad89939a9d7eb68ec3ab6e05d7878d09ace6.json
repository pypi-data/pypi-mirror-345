{"content": "Here is the updated report based on the execution logs:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\nA coal mining and processing setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt at (41.5, -80.5) facing right\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) \n- Stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0) facing up\n\nThe setup appears to be having issues with coal flow and positioning, with the mining drill waiting for space on the belt and the inserter having placement/rotation issues.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- The agent tried placing transport belts and inserters in positions that were blocked by existing entities\n\n### Inserter Positioning and Rotation Issues\n- Ensure inserters are properly positioned and rotated to reach both pickup and drop locations\n- Multiple attempts were made to fix inserter positioning/rotation - validate the positions and rotations before placement\n- Consider the working area of inserters relative to belts and furnaces\n\n### Belt Blockage Issues\n- Clear blocked belts regularly to maintain material flow\n- The mining drill is waiting because the output belt is blocked with coal\n- Implement a system to prevent belt saturation\n\n### Entity Status Monitoring\n- Monitor entity warnings and status to identify issues:\n  - Mining drill waiting for belt space\n  - Furnace showing \"no ingredients\" warning\n  - Inserter showing \"output blocked\" warning\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- vertical_belt: TransportBelt\n- inserter: BurnerInserter\n\n### Entity States\n- Mining drill fuel level: 13-15 coal\n- Belt inventory: 6 coal\n- Inserter fuel: 29-30 coal\n- Furnace fuel: 50 coal (full)\n\nThe logs show repeated attempts to adjust entity positions and rotations, suggesting the need for better position validation before placement attempts."}
