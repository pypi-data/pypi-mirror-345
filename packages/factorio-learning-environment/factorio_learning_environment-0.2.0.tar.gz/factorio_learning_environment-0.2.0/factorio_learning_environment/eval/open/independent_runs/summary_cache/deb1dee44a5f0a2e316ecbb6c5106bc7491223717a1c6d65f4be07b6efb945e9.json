{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Offshore Pump at position(106.5, -32.5)\nConsists of offshore pump at position (106.5, -32.5) and pipes at positions (107.5, -34.5), (105.5, -32.5), (105.5, -31.5), and (106.5, -31.5)\n\n### Boiler at position(111.5, -32.0)\nConsists of boiler at position (111.5, -32.0) and pipes at positions (109.5, -33.5), (110.5, -33.5), (111.5, -33.5), (112.5, -33.5), and (113.5, -33.5)\n\n### Generator at position(117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of steam engine at position (117.5, -30.5) and pipes at positions (115.5, -33.5), (116.5, -33.5), and (117.5, -33.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) and furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of small electric poles at positions (111.5, -30.5), (115.5, -32.5), (115.5, -30.5), (120.5, -26.5), and (112.5, -24.5)\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of transport belts at positions (39.5, -83.5), (38.5, -79.5), (63.5, -53.5), and (64.5, -53.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when using connect_entities function\n  - Make sure to pass the correct number of arguments to the connect_entities function. It takes 3 positional arguments, not 5.\n  - Ensure that the positions passed to the connect_entities function are of the correct type.\n* Errors when placing entities\n  - Make sure to check if the tile is occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n* Errors when using offshore pumps\n  - Make sure to connect the offshore pump to a fluid system to avoid \"no fluid present in connections\" warnings.\n* Errors when using boilers\n  - Make sure to provide fuel to the boiler to avoid \"out of fuel\" warnings.\n* Errors when using generators\n  - Make sure to connect the generator to a fluid system to avoid \"no input liquid\" warnings.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* connect_entities function\n  - Invoked multiple times with incorrect arguments, resulting in TypeError.\n  - Should be used to connect two entities with a pipe.\n* offshore_pump variable\n  - Assigned the value of an offshore pump entity.\n  - Type: Entity\n* boiler variable\n  - Assigned the value of a boiler entity.\n  - Type: Entity\n* Prototype.Pipe\n  - Used as an argument to the connect_entities function.\n  - Type: Prototype"}
