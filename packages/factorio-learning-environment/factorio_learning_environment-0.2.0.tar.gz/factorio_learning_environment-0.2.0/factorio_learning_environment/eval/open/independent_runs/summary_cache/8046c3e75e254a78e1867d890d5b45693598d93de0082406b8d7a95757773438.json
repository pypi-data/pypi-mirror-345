{"content": "```\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal storage at position (5.5, -57.5)\nConsists of a wooden chest at (5.5, -57.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when lacking items\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. The agent tried to craft items without having enough iron ore and wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when harvesting\n- The agent attempted to harvest wood but failed due to an indexing error. This suggests an issue with how the harvesting function is being called, specifically with string indices being used instead of integers. Review the harvesting logic to ensure correct indexing.\n\n### Errors related to inserter blockage\n- The inserter at (40.5, -80.5) is blocked by the transport belt at (39.5, -80.5), but the inserters at (6.5, -57.5) and (8.5, -57.5) are also blocked.\n- Ensure that inserters are not blocked by other entities, such as transport belts, before placing them. Also, check for blockages after placing new entities.\n\n### Errors related to transport belts disappearing\n- The transport belt is no longer there.\n- Ensure the transport belts are not removed by other actions or entities.\n\n### Errors related to inserter fuel\n- The inserter already has fuel.\n- Before inserting fuel into an inserter, check if it already has fuel.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\nNo functions have been defined by the agent.\n\n### Variables:\n- Inventory: {'transport-belt': 13, 'burner-inserter': 2, 'wood': 100, 'coal': 3589-3596, 'iron-plate': 401}\n- Inserter inventory: {'coal': 46}\n```"}
