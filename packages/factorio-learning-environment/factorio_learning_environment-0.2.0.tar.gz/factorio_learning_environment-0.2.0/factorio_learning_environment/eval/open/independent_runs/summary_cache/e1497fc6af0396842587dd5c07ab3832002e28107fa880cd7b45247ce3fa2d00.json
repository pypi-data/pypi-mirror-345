{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, and the map remains empty of any structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, ore inserters, plate inserters, and output chests have failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors with movement commands\n- Verify the data type and structure of position arguments when using movement commands. Errors occurred due to incorrect handling of position data, such as using string indices instead of integers or treating 'Position' objects incorrectly.\n\n### Errors with building area setup\n- Adjust the size of the BuildingBox or use multiple smaller BuildingBoxes when no viable placement is found. An error occurred when trying to clear an area for a Wooden Chest with an oversized BuildingBox.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure they are valid and accessible for placing entities. Repeated attempts to place entities at various coordinates failed, indicating potential issues with the specified positions."}
