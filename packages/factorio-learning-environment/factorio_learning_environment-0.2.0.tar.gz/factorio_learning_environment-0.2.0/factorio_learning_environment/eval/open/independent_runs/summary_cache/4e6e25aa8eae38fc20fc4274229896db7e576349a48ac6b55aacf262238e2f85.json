{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here's the report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Operation at position(24.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(24.0, -15.0)\n- Storage chest at position(23.5, -16.5)\nCurrently mining coal with 39997 resources remaining\n\n###Copper Processing Complex at position(20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore (39997 resources)\n- Input chest at position(20.5, 21.5) for copper ore storage\n- Two inserters:\n  - Inserter at position(19.5, 21.5) moving ore from belt to chest\n  - Inserter at position(21.5, 21.5) moving ore from chest to belt\n- Stone furnace at position(24.0, 20.0) for smelting\n- Output chest at position(24.5, 17.5) containing copper plates\n- Furnace inserter at position(24.5, 18.5)\n- Complex belt system connecting these components with multiple transport belts\n\n###Iron Mining Operation at position(-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-14.0, 23.0)\n- Storage chest at position(-14.5, 21.5)\nCurrently mining iron ore with 39997 resources remaining\n\n###Unused Furnace Group\nTwo unused furnaces at positions:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Transport Belt Connection Errors\n- When creating belt connections, ensure you're using the correct object attributes. The error suggests attempting to access 'belts' attribute on a TransportBelt object which doesn't exist\n\n###Belt Blocking Issues\n- Clear blocked transport belts before continuing operations. Specifically, the belt at position(22.5, 21.5) is blocking the inserter operations\n\n###Entity Placement\n- When creating new structures, ensure proper spacing between entities to prevent blocking and allow for efficient material flow\n- Verify that inserters have clear pickup and drop positions before placement\n\n###Resource Management\n- Multiple furnaces are idle due to lack of ingredients. Ensure proper resource flow to all processing structures\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to maintain continuous operation"}
