Check the connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to ensure they are correct and that there is no blockage in the pipes.\n\n### Boiler Not Connected to Fluid Source\n- Verify that the boiler is connected to a fluid source, such as an offshore pump, and that the pipes are correctly aligned to allow fluid flow. Ensure that there are no gaps or misaligned pipes in the fluid system.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check that the input resources are available and correctly inserted into the furnaces.\n\n### Offshore Pump Not Connected\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is connected to the fluid system and that there are no missing or incorrectly placed pipes between the pump and the intended destination."}
