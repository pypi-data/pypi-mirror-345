{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 41.0, -80.0) with 1 iron ore in the input inventory and 15 iron plates produced.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (42.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 42.0, -79.0) with 1 iron ore in the input inventory and 8 iron plates produced.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors related to crafting requirements\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft. For example, you need at least 5 stones to craft a Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient resources in the furnace\n- Monitor the fuel levels in the furnace to avoid running out of coal, which can halt production. Harvest more coal proactively when levels are low.\n\n### Errors related to recipe retrieval\n- Ensure that the prototypes you are trying to craft have valid recipes. If you encounter an error stating that a recipe could not be found, check if the prototype is available in the game or if you have the necessary technology unlocked.\n\n### Errors related to incorrect entity references\n- When using functions that require an entity, ensure you are passing the correct entity reference instead of a position. For example, use the actual furnace entity rather than its position when inserting items.\n\n### Errors related to incorrect entity references (repeated)\n- The second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Review your insert_item calls to ensure you are using the correct entity references instead of positions."}
