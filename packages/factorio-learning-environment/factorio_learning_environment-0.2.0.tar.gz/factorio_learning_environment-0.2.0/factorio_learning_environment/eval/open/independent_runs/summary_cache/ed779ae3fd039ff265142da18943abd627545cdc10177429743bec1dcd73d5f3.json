{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5), currently working and fueled with coal. The drill is connected to a stone furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0), fueled with coal, but currently has no ingredients to smelt. The furnace is intended to produce iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Transport Belt Placement Errors**: Ensure the desired location is clear and suitable for placing transport belts. Multiple attempts to place belts have failed due to occupied or unsuitable tiles.\n- **Wooden Chest Placement Errors**: Verify that the target location for placing wooden chests is not occupied by another entity or obstructed.\n- **Burner Inserter Placement Errors**: Check that the placement location for burner inserters is clear and correctly aligned with the intended input and output entities.\n\n### Errors Related to Connectivity and Positioning\n- **Belt Connection Errors**: When connecting belts, ensure that they are not being directly connected to incompatible entities like stone furnaces. Use inserters to input items into furnaces instead.\n- **Positioning Errors with Stone Furnace**: Ensure that the stone furnace is correctly positioned and accessible. An error occurred when attempting to interact with a stone furnace at a non-existent position.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Output Blockage Warning**: The burner mining drill has a warning indicating that its output is blocked. Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output from the drill.\n- **Furnace No Ingredients Warning**: The stone furnace is not operational due to a lack of ingredients. Ensure that the necessary raw materials are supplied to the furnace for continuous operation."}
