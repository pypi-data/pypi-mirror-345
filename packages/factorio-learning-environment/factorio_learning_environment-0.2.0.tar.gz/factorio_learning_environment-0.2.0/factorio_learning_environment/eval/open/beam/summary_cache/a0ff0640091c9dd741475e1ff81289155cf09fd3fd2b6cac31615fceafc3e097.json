Always check the type of the target before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities.

In this case, the 'Furnace' object does not have a 'drop_position' attribute. Use the correct attributes as per the entity's documentation.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have enough 'iron-ore' in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the stone furnace. The error \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" indicates that the required quantity is not available."}
