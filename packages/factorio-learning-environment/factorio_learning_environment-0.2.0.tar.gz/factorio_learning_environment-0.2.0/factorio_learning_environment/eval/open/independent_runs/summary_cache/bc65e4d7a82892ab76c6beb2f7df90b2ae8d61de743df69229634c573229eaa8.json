{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Connected Pipe Network spanning positions from (-68.5, -95.5) to (-46.5, -122.0)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Laboratory at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5) with no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Entity Retrieval Functions\n- Ensure the entity type and position are correct before attempting to retrieve an entity. For example, the error \"Could not get Prototype.Lab at position x=0.0 y=0.0\" suggests that the lab was not found at the specified position.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items into Entities\n- Verify that the items you wish to insert are present in your inventory. The error \"Could not insert: No automation-science-pack to insert from your inventory\" indicates that the item was not available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a power network. The inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) is not receiving electricity, indicating a possible disconnection from the power network.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory or Storage\n- Regularly check and clear storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. The warning \"chest at drop position is full\" suggests that the chest at (-15.5, -77.5) needs to be emptied."}
