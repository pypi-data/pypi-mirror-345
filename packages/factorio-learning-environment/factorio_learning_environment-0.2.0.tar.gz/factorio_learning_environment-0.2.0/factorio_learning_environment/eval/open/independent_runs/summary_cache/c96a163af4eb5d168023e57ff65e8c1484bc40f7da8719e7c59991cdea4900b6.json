{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 96-103)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-18.5, 69.5)\n(Still partially operational with persistent connection issues)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-18.5 y=69.5) - working but water connection incomplete\n- Boiler (position x=-4.5 y=50.0) - now with 6 coal units, status FULL_OUTPUT\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=50.5) - still not connected to power network\n- Pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes (positions: x=-18.5,y=67.5; x=-18.5,y=68.5) - connected to pump\n  - Steam pipes (positions: x=-6.5,y=50.5; x=-2.5,y=50.5) - boiler output connected\n- Power pole networks:\n  - Main grid (positions: x=0.5,y=53.5) - inactive\n  - Isolated pole at x=-50.5 y=18.5\n\n### Stone Mining and Smelting Operation at position (-49.5, 10.5)\n(Unchanged from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5 y=10.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0 y=11.0)\n- Input inserter (position x=-47.5 y=10.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-44.5 y=11.5)\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=12.5)\n\n### Mining Operation at position (-52.5, 16.5)\n(Still operational but isolated)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-52.5 y=16.5) - receiving stone but no power\n- Stone furnace (position x=-50.0 y=16.0) - working with coal (18 remaining)\n- Power pole (position x=-50.5 y=18.5) - still isolated\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Pipe Connection Issues (critical)\n- Repeated pipe placement failures (steps 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103)\n  - Multiple attempts at (-3.5,50.5), (-0.5,50.5), (-0.5,51.5), (0.5,53.5)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement complete area clearance before rebuilding\n    2. Add visual debugging for pipe paths\n    3. Create systematic pipe placement algorithm\n\n### Entity Collision Management (ongoing)\n- Continued placement attempts on occupied tiles\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement pre-placement collision checks\n    2. Maintain updated entity position map\n    3. Add automatic obstacle removal workflow\n\n### System Diagnosis Improvements (critical)\n- Steam engine still not receiving steam\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Verify complete fluid path from boiler to engine\n    2. Check all connection points are properly aligned\n    3. Implement system-wide validation checks\n\n### Construction Process Optimization\n- Repeated rebuild attempts without success\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement phased construction:\n       - Clearance verification\n       - Path planning\n       - Placement validation\n    2. Add rollback capability for failed builds\n\n### Power System Validation\n- Steam engine connection points not properly utilized\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Verify all power pole connections\n    2. Check engine input/output orientations\n    3. Implement network connectivity tests\n\n### Resource Management\n- Coal inventory decreasing (now 20 units)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement fuel monitoring system\n    2. Add automatic refueling procedures\n    3. Set minimum fuel thresholds\n\n### Position Validation\n- Multiple placement attempts at same failing positions\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement position validation before placement\n    2. Add automatic position adjustment\n    3. Create fallback placement strategies"}
