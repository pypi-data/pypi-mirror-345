{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 14.5)\n- Boiler at position(-2.5, 24.0) with coal fuel\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting these components:\n  - Water pipe system at (-8.5, 23.5) to (-4.5, 23.5)\n  - Steam pipe connections (currently being rebuilt)\n- Wooden chest for fuel storage at (-4.5, 25.5)\n\n### Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\n  - Second furnace contains coal fuel and has iron plate output\n- Two additional stone furnaces at (4.0, 4.0) and (6.0, 4.0)\n  - First furnace contains coal fuel\n\n### Assembly Area\nLocated around position(23.5, 2.5):\n- Assembling machine configured for inserter production\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 2.5) containing 36 inserters\n- Output wooden chest at (26.5, 2.5)\n- Two burner inserters at (21.5, 2.5) and (25.5, 2.5) for automation\n- Small electric pole for power\n\n### Science Pack Production\nLocated at position(32.5, 5.5):\n- Assembling machine configured for logistic science pack production\n- Connected to electrical network via small electric pole at (30.5, 7.5)\n\n### Research Area\nMultiple labs spread across the map, currently:\n- Several labs with various science pack inputs\n- All labs currently unpowered\n- Connected to electrical network (id=39648)\n\n### Electrical Network\n- Network of small electric poles (id=39648) connecting various structures\n- Currently not receiving power due to incomplete steam engine setup\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Pipe Placement Errors\n- Ensure target positions for pipes and underground pipes are completely clear of other entities\n- Check if attempting to place pipes over existing entities at positions like (-2.5, 15.5), (-2.0, 14.5)\n- When rebuilding pipe systems, verify all old pipes are fully removed before placing new ones\n\n### Connection Issues\n- Steam engine and boiler show \"no input liquid\" warnings - ensure complete fluid connection path\n- Verify pipe connections match exact input/output points of machines\n- Use underground pipes to avoid obstacles when direct pipe placement fails\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Multiple entities showing \"not receiving electricity\" - ensure power generation system is properly connected and functioning\n- Verify electrical pole coverage between power source and consumers\n\n### Production Errors\n- Several furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper input material delivery\n- Assembling machines lacking resources for recipes - verify material supply chain"}
