{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity generator at position (5.5, 0.0)\nConsists of boiler (position (3.5, 4.0)), steam engine (position (9.5, 0.5)), offshore pump (position (-9.5, -0.5)), and associated pipes. The boiler and steam engine are still not properly connected to the offshore pump.\n\n#### Sulfur production facility at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of chemical plant (position (0.5, 0.5)), offshore pump (position (-9.5, -0.5)), and associated pipes. The chemical plant is now connected to the power network.\n\n#### Oil processing facility at position (10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of oil refinery (position (10.5, 10.5)) and pumpjack (position (17.5, 40.5)). The oil refinery and pumpjack are now connected to the power network.\n\n#### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, including the offshore pump, boiler, steam engine, chemical plant, oil refinery, and pumpjack.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when connecting entities:\n  - Ensure entities are properly connected with pipes or power poles.\n  - Check that the entities are within the correct distance for connection.\n  - Make sure none of the source or target connections points are blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n* Errors when placing entities:\n  - Ensure the target location is not occupied by another entity or water.\n  - Check the terrain is suitable for the entity being placed.\n  - Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction or changing the reference position if an entity already exists at the new position.\n* Common connection issues:\n  - Boiler and steam engine not connected: Check the pipe connections between them.\n  - Offshore pump and boiler not connected: Check the pipe connections between them.\n* New error tips:\n  - Avoid attempting to place a pipe or underground pipe at a position that is already occupied by another entity.\n  - Be cautious when using `get_entity` with an entity's prototype and position, as it may raise an AssertionError if not used correctly.\n  - Ensure that variables are defined before using them to avoid NameError.\n  - Check that the direction of underground pipes is correctly set to avoid placement errors.\n  - Do not attempt to insert items into an entity's inventory if it is full.\n  - Be aware that certain entities like 'PipeGroup' do not have a 'warnings' attribute.\n  - Ensure that pipes are properly connected between entities to avoid \"Did not find any valid connections\" errors.\n  - Repeatedly failing to connect boiler to steam engine and offshore pump to boiler indicates a need to review pipe placement strategy.\n  - Be aware that attempting to place an underground pipe or boiler at an occupied position will result in an error.\n  - Be aware that using undefined variables will result in a NameError.\n  - The agent is repeatedly trying to place a boiler at different positions but failing due to occupied or unplaceable terrain, indicating a need to review the placement strategy for boilers.\n  - Be aware that attempting to place a steam engine at a position occupied by another entity will result in an error.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- `oil_refinery_position`: The position where the oil refinery is to be placed (Type not specified).\n- `chemical_plant`: The entity representing the chemical plant (Type not specified).\n- `offshore_pump`: The entity representing the offshore pump (Type not specified).\n- `boiler`: The entity representing the boiler (Type not specified).\n- `steam_engine`: The entity representing the steam engine (Type not specified).\n- `pumpjack`: The entity representing the pumpjack (Type not specified).\n- `oil_refinery`: The entity representing the oil refinery (Type not specified)."}
