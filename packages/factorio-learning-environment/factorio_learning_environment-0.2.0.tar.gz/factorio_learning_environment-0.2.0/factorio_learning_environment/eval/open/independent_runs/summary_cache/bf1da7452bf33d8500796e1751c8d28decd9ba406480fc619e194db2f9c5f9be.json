{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory of 5 coal, currently not processing due to no ingredients.\n- Furnace at position (-13.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory of 4 coal, currently not processing due to no ingredients.\n- Furnace at position (-11.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory of 10 coal, currently not processing due to no ingredients.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Processing at Position (-5.5, y=-50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron chest at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) storing 216 iron ore and 1059 iron plates.\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions ranging from (-14.5, y=-50.5) to (-7.5, y=-50.5), some of which are full and contain iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.5, y=-58.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with 3 coal in its fuel inventory, currently working but unable to continue due to a full chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) storing 6 iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from halting due to full inventory warnings.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to maintain continuous production. Regularly check and refill the furnace source inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Represents the count of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Represents the count of iron plates produced and stored.\n- `coal_count: int` - Represents the count of coal harvested and used as fuel.\n\nThis report provides an overview of existing structures, error tips, and namespace details based on the latest execution steps."}
