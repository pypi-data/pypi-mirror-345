{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0)\n\nThis facility is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The stone furnace has been refueled multiple times with coal and has been intermittently supplied with iron ore. It currently contains iron ore and is actively producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Placement\n- Ensure that the required item is available in the inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, the attempt to place a stone furnace failed initially because there was no stone furnace in the inventory.\n- The agent attempted to place a burner inserter at position (-9.0, -50.0) without having a burner inserter in the inventory. Always verify the availability of the entity in the inventory before placement.\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Ingredients for Crafting\n- Verify that all necessary ingredients are available before crafting. The agent could not craft a stone furnace initially due to a lack of stone.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity contains the item you wish to extract before attempting extraction. The agent encountered an error when trying to extract iron plates from the furnace because the furnace did not contain any iron plates at that time.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Inventory\n- Confirm that the items you wish to insert are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. The agent faced an error when trying to insert iron ore into the furnace without having iron ore in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Fuel without Inventory\n- Ensure that the fuel you wish to insert is present in your inventory before attempting to refuel an entity. The agent encountered an error when trying to insert coal into the furnace without having coal in the inventory."}
