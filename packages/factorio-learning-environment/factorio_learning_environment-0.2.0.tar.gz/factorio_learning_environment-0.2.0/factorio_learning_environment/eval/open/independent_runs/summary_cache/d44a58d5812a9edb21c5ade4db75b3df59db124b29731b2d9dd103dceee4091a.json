{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and another at (-18.0, -70.0), both with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) connected to a transport belt network, waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) connected to a transport belt network, waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting various positions for ore transport.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) connected to the transport belt network, waiting for source items.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Processing\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connections\n- Ensure that transport belts are correctly oriented and connected to form a continuous path. Errors such as \"Could not connect transport-belt\" indicate a misalignment or incorrect orientation. Double-check the direction and position of each belt segment.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Inserters at positions (-20.5, -66.5), (-17.5, -64.5), and (2.5, 0.5) are waiting for source items. Ensure that the source items are available and correctly positioned on the belts or in adjacent containers to avoid idle inserters."}
