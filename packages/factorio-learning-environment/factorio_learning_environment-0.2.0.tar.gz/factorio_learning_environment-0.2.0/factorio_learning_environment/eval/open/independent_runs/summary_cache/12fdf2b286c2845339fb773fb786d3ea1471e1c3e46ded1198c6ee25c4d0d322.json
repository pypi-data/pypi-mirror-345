{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 10.5, 10.5) with status NO_POWER.\n\n### Small Electric Pole at position (6.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole (position 6.5, 0.5) connected to the nearest power source.\n  \n### Small Electric Pole at position (13.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole (position 13.5, 10.5) providing power to the lab.\n  \n### Small Electric Pole at position (16.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole (position 16.5, 10.5) providing additional power.\n\n### Small Electric Pole at position (20.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole (position 20.5, 10.5) providing additional power.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and producing iron plates.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 2.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 2.0, 2.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 5.5, 0.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to obstructions\n- Ensure the target location is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. For example, the lab could not be placed at (0.5, 1.5) due to obstructions.\n\n### Errors when trying to place electric poles\n- Confirm that there is a suitable position available before placing small electric poles. For instance, the pole at (10.5, 11.5) could not be placed due to an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors when searching for nearby entities\n- If attempting to find the nearest power source (like a small electric pole or steam engine), ensure that such entities exist on the map. The agent encountered issues finding the nearest small electric pole and steam engine.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Always check inventory before attempting to place entities. The agent received an error when trying to place a small electric pole at (3.5, 0.5) because there were no small electric poles left in inventory.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to connect entities. The agent failed to connect a small electric pole to a furnace due to lacking the necessary items."}
