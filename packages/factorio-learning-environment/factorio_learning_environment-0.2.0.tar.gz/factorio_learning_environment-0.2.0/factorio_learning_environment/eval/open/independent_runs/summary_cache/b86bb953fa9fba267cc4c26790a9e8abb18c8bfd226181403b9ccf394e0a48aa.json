{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Power Network\n- Expanded power network from the lab at position (5.5, 5.5) to the power source at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions including (13.5, 27.5), (7.5, 17.5), (9.5, 23.5), (7.5, 9.5), (16.5, 31.5), and (12.5, 34.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -82.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n- Belt Group for transporting coal\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates and coal\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Lab\n- Lab at position (5.5, 5.5) with input for automation science packs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Electricity Group Connections\n- Ensure that all electricity poles are properly connected to form a complete circuit. Verify connections between poles and power sources to avoid \"No electricity group found\" errors.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Group Connections\n- Check the connections of pipes to ensure they are properly linked to the fluid source and destination. Avoid \"No pipe group found\" errors by verifying the integrity of the pipe network.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as boilers and burner mining drills to prevent interruptions in operations due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure chests are not full to avoid mining interruptions. Regularly empty chests to maintain continuous mining operations."}
