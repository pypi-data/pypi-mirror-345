{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace and Burner Inserter Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 1.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Ensure that the tile is unoccupied and free from obstructions before attempting to place a chest. Check nearby entities and adjust the position if necessary.\n\n### Errors in Chest Placement Logic\n- Correct the logic in the code to ensure that the placement function is being called correctly. Avoid using callable syntax on non-callable objects like 'Position'.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Iron Ore\n- Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of iron ore available to supply to furnaces. Regularly check and replenish resources as needed.\n\n### Errors in BuildingBox Definition\n- Verify the correct usage of data types when defining dimensions or properties of entities like the Wooden Chest. Refer to the documentation for correct usage.\n\n### Errors in Code Syntax\n- Review and correct any syntax errors in the code, such as incorrect function calls or object usage, to prevent runtime errors."}
