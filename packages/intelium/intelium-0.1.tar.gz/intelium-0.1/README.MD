[![Intelium Preview](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OoZpDdprG1o/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OoZpDdprG1o)

## üöÄ Vision

Intelium is not just another automation framework - it's a vision for a world where any digital interaction can be automated with human-like precision. Whether you're automating browser interactions, desktop applications, or complex workflows, Intelium provides a unified, intelligent approach to automation that feels natural and reliable.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### ü§ñ Human-Like Interactions
- Natural mouse movements with randomized offsets
- Variable typing speeds with realistic timing
- Smooth scrolling with acceleration/deceleration
- Intelligent element detection with tolerance for visual variations

### üåê Universal Automation
- **Browser Automation**: Support for Selenium, Playwright, and more
- **Desktop Automation**: Native system interactions with OCR capabilities
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Extensible**: Easy to add support for new automation targets

### üéØ Smart Element Detection
- Template matching with scale and rotation tolerance
- OCR-powered text detection (optional)
- Confidence-based matching
- Duplicate detection and filtering

### ‚ö° Performance & Reliability
- Asynchronous operation support
- Robust error handling
- Viewport-aware interactions
- Resource-efficient operation

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

```python
from intelium import DesktopAutomation, BrowserAutomation

# Desktop Automation
desktop = DesktopAutomation()
desktop.move_to({'x': 100, 'y': 100})
desktop.click_at({'x': 100, 'y': 100})

# Browser Automation
from selenium import webdriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
browser = BrowserAutomation(driver)
element = driver.find_element("id", "my-button")
browser.click_at(element)
```

## üîß Installation

```bash
pip install intelium
```

## üìö Usage Examples

### Desktop Automation
```python
from intelium import DesktopAutomation

# Initialize with OCR support
automation = DesktopAutomation(ocr=True)

# Find elements by image
elements = automation.find_elements(
    image_path="button.png",
    min_confidence=0.8
)

# Find elements by text
text_elements = automation.find_text_elements(
    query="Click me",
    min_confidence=0.8
)

# Interact with elements
for element in elements:
    automation.move_to(element)
    automation.click_at(element)
    automation.type_at(element, "Hello, World!")
```

### Browser Automation
```python
from intelium import BrowserAutomation
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
automation = BrowserAutomation(driver)

# Navigate and interact
driver.get("https://example.com")
element = driver.find_element("id", "search")
automation.type_at(element, "Search query")
automation.click_at(element)
```
