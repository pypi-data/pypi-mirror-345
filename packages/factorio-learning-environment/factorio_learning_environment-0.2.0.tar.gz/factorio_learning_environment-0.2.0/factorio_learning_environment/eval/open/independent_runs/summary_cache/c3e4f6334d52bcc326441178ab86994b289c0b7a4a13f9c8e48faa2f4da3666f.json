{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) supplied with iron ore and coal, producing iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) supplied with iron ore and coal, producing iron plates.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) with pickup position (-13.5, -48.5) and drop position (-13.5, -46.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) with pickup position (-14.5, -46.5) and drop position (-14.5, -44.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -45.5) with pickup position (-13.5, -46.5) and drop position (-13.5, -44.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-11.5, -45.5) with pickup position (-11.5, -44.5) and drop position (-11.5, -46.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-9.5, -44.5) with pickup position (-8.5, -44.5) and drop position (-10.5, -44.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-14.5, -43.5) with pickup position (-14.5, -44.5) and drop position (-14.5, -42.5), waiting for source items.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5).\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5).\n- **Belts**:\n  - Belt at position (-16.5, -47.5) outputting towards (-16.5, -46.5).\n  - Belt at position (-14.5, -46.5) outputting towards (-14.5, -47.5).\n  - Belt at position (-12.5, -46.5) outputting towards (-11.5, -46.5).\n  - BeltGroup connecting various entities, facilitating movement of items between furnaces, inserters, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply furnaces. This will prevent errors related to inserting items when the inventory is empty.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. This will prevent inserters from being in a waiting state, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Belt Direction and Connectivity\n- Verify that belts are correctly connected and oriented to ensure smooth transportation of items between entities. Misaligned belts can disrupt the flow of resources."}
