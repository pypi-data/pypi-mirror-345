{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0), which is actively extracting iron ore with a working status. It is fueled and has a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0), which is currently producing iron plates. It is fueled with coal and has iron ore in its source inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Ensure that all required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, the error \"Could not place burner-mining-drill at (-21.0, -52.0), No burner_mining_drill in inventory\" indicates a shortage of the required item.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities in Occupied or Invalid Locations\n- Verify that the target location is unoccupied and valid before placing an entity. Errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the desired location\" and \"Cannot place Transport Belt at the desired location\" suggest that the target tile is either occupied or invalid for placement.\n\n### Errors Due to Incorrect Setup of Production Chains\n- Ensure that all components of a production chain are correctly set up and connected. The repeated error \"The furnace is not producing iron plates. Check the setup\" indicates potential issues in the setup of the production chain, such as incorrect connections or missing components.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Belts\n- Make sure that inserters and belts are correctly positioned and oriented to facilitate the movement of items between entities. Errors like \"Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location\" may indicate incorrect placement or orientation."}
