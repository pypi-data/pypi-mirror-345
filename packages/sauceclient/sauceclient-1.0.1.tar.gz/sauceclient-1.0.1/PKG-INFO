## About sauceclient

**sauceclient** is a Python client library for the Sauce Labs API. You can
manage a test environment and retrieve test assets from Sauce Labs.

The API gives remote access to:

 * Test Jobs & Assets (Results, Logs, Videos, Screenshots)
 * Account
 * Platform Information
 * JavaScript Unit Tests
 * Temporary Storage
 * Tunnels

Note: **sauceclient** is not used for running tests on Sauce Labs' services.
Test execution is handled by your testing tool or library (Selenium,
Playwright, Cypress, Appium, etc).
