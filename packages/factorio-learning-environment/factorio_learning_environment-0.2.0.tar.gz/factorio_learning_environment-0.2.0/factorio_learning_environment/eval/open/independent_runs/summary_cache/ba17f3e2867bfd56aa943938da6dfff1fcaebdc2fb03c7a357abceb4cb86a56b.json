{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) with a drop position at (x=42.5, y=-81.5). The drill is fueled with wood and is currently working, but the output is blocked due to no sink entity to accept the output. It is mining coal with a remaining count of 39,997 units.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0). The furnace is working with an empty fuel inventory, processing iron ore into iron plates. It currently holds 6 units of iron ore and 100 units of iron plates. The furnace result inventory is full, indicating a need for output management.\n\n### Storage Facility at Position (x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5). The chest is in normal status with an empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Wooden Chest\n- Ensure the intended position for placing a Wooden Chest is not occupied by another entity or obstructed. Verify the placement area is clear before attempting to place the chest.\n\n### Errors Related to Undefined Variables in Code\n- When using variables in code, ensure they are defined before use. For example, the variable 'inserter' must be defined before referencing its attributes. Check for typos or missing definitions in your code.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drill\n- Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill. This will prevent the drill's output from being blocked and allow continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Output Management\n- Regularly check the output inventory of the Stone Furnace to ensure it does not become full. Implement a mechanism to transfer the output, such as using inserters or conveyor belts, to maintain continuous production."}
