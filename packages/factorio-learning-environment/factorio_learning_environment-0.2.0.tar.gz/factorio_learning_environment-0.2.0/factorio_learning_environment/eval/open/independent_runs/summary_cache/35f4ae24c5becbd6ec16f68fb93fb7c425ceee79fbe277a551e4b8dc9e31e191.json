Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly monitor and clear out the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Furnace Production Issues\n- Ensure that the furnace has sufficient iron ore to process. Check and maintain a steady supply of raw materials to keep production continuous.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and have a clear path to transfer items between entities. Adjust positions if necessary to ensure smooth operation."}
