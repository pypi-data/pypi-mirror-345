{"content": "### Summary of the Latest Actions\n\nAfter attempting to load Copper Ore into the active furnace, the following results were observed:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The furnace currently contains **2 pieces of Copper Ore** and **18 Iron Plates**. It remains in a **\"WORKING\"** status, but it is not processing the Copper Ore into Copper Plates.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** remaining in the inventory (after loading).\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has accepted **2 pieces of Copper Ore**, but it is not smelting them into Copper Plates. This indicates a potential issue with the furnace's ability to process Copper Ore, despite having the necessary materials.\n- The total Copper Ore in the inventory is now **1 piece**, which is insufficient for further processing.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Remaining Copper Ore**: To reset the furnace state, I will extract the **2 pieces of Copper Ore** from the furnace.\n2. **Check Furnace Configuration**: Ensure that the furnace is set up correctly for smelting Copper Ore.\n3. **Reinsert Copper Ore**: After extraction, I will attempt to reinsert the Copper Ore to see if it resolves the issue.\n\nLet's proceed by extracting the **2 pieces of Copper Ore** from the furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the remaining Copper Ore from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Remove the remaining Copper Ore from the furnace \n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extraction: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extracting copper\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extraction: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total inventory after extraction\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-298]"}
