{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** (position: (-15.0, -50.0)): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently contains 23 iron ore and 11 iron plates. Fueled by coal.\n\n#### Burner Mining Drill at position (-18.0, -52.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** (position: (-18.0, -52.0)): Used for mining iron ore. Currently fueled by coal and working. Output is directed to a wooden chest at position (-18.5, -53.5).\n\n#### Wooden Chest at position (-18.5, -53.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** (position: (-18.5, -53.5)): Used for storing iron ore mined by the burner mining drill. Currently contains 11 iron ore.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, placing a wooden chest requires 2 wood, and placing a transport belt requires iron plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items without a crafting machine\n- Some items, like iron plates and iron gear wheels, require a crafting machine or furnace to be crafted. Ensure you have the necessary infrastructure (e.g., a furnace) before attempting to craft these items.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Ensure you have the required items (iron plates and iron gear wheels) in your inventory before attempting to connect entities with transport belts. Verify the positions and orientations of the entities.\n\n#### Errors when smelting due to insufficient fuel or inputs\n- Always ensure the furnace has enough fuel (coal) and input materials (iron ore) before starting the smelting process. If smelting times out, check the furnace's fuel and input inventory.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has completed smelting and contains the desired items before attempting to extract them. If the furnace is still working, wait for the process to complete.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is not already occupied by another entity. Check the map for existing structures or entities that might block placement.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Ensure you have the required items (coal and iron ore) in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace. If the furnace is full, wait for it to process the current batch before adding more.\n\n#### Errors when crafting transport belts\n- Ensure you have enough iron plates and iron gear wheels in your inventory before attempting to craft transport belts. If you lack the necessary materials, smelt more iron ore or craft more iron gear wheels.\n\n#### Errors when harvesting resources\n- Ensure you are close enough to the resource (e.g., wood, coal, iron ore) before attempting to harvest it. Move to the resource's position before starting the harvesting process."}
