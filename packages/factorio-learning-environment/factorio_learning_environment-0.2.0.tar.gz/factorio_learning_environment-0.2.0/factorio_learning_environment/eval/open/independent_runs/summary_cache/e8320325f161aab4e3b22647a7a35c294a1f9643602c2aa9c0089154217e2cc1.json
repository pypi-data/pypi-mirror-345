{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (-15.0, -50.0)\nA smelting line for processing iron ore consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) facing down, mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -48.5) transferring ore from drill to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) for smelting iron ore into plates\n\nThe structure is fueled with coal and set up to automatically mine and smelt iron ore. Currently waiting for space in destination and ingredients to process.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if the target position is already occupied by another entity before placing\n- When placing entities next to each other, use appropriate spacing parameters to avoid overlap\n- Consider the tile dimensions of entities when calculating placement positions\n\n### Errors with missing inventory items\n- Ensure required items (like coal for fuel) are in inventory before attempting to insert into entities\n- Keep track of inventory quantities, especially for consumable items like coal\n\n### Errors with entity crafting requirements\n- Some items like iron plates can only be crafted in furnaces or machines, not directly\n- Check recipe requirements and use appropriate crafting facilities\n- Ensure all ingredient items are available before attempting crafting\n\n### Errors with entity placement directions\n- Consider entity output directions when placing connected structures\n- Align entities properly to enable item flow between them\n- Use appropriate facing directions for mining drills based on ore patch location"}
