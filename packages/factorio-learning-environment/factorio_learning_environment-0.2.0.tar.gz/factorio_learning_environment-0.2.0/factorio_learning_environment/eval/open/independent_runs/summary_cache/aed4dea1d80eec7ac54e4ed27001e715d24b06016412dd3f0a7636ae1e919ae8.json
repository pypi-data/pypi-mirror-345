{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine with positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 22.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 24.5), and (1.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel\n- Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for transferring materials\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n- Small Electric Poles around the facility for power distribution, although currently not connected\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -59.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not powered\n- Connected to the electricity network but not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure pipes are placed on suitable terrain. Avoid placing pipes where the entity footprint overlaps with water.\n\n### Errors in Power Distribution\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect electric poles.\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity network are properly connected and receiving power.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have all required sub-ingredients before crafting. Copper cables require copper plates, which need to be smelted in a furnace.\n- Make sure you have access to a crafting machine or furnace for items that cannot be crafted manually.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Keep track of your inventory to ensure you have enough resources to craft items and build structures."}
