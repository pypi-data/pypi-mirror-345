{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-12.0, -51.0), operational and extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0), not operational due to lack of ingredients, but has a furnace result inventory of 22 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -48.5), waiting for source items, intended to move items from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-8.5, -49.5), currently empty, presumably for storage of finished iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (52.0, -82.0), operational and extracting coal, but output is blocked by items on the ground.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (52.5, -79.5), waiting for source items, intended to transfer coal from the mining drill to a storage or processing unit.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (52.5, -77.5), currently empty, presumably for storage of extracted coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Stone Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) is supplied with the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to become operational. Consider checking the supply chain from the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n### Output Blocked by Items on the Ground\n- The burner mining drills at positions (52.0, -82.0) and (-12.0, -51.0) have their outputs blocked. Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to receive the output from these drills.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- The burner inserters at positions (-11.5, -48.5) and (52.5, -79.5) are waiting for source items. Verify that the source entities are operational and capable of supplying items to these inserters.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Current inventory includes 56 units of coal and 212 units of iron plates."}
