{"content": "Ah, I see the issue now. We need to craft the burner mining drill first! Let's fix this:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Starting inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Craft burner mining drill\n# Recipe requires: 3 iron plates, 3 iron gear wheels, 1 stone furnace\n# First craft the iron gear wheels needed\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=3)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting gears: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Now craft the burner mining drill\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting drill: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Find iron ore and place new mining setup\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# Place and fuel the drill\ndrill = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, \n                    position=iron_pos,\n                    direction=Direction.DOWN)\nif drill:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=10)\n    print(f\"Placed and fueled mining drill at: {drill.position}\")\n    \n    # Place furnace with correct spacing\n    furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n        Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n        reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n        direction=Direction.DOWN,\n        spacing=1\n    )\n    if furnace:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=10)\n        print(f\"Placed and fueled furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entity status: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis should work better because:\n1. We're crafting the required iron gear wheels first\n2. Then crafting the burner mining drill\n3. Then placing it with proper orientation\n4. And finally setting up the furnace\n\nThe previous attempts failed because we didn't have a burner mining drill in our inventory - we needed to craft it first!", "summary_range": "[1-224]"}
