{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) that is currently working and has a fuel inventory of coal.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that stores iron ore, currently containing 38 iron ore.\n- The Burner Mining Drill is extracting iron ore from the Wooden Chest.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently working and has a fuel inventory of coal. It is producing iron plates, currently having 61 iron plates in its output inventory.\n- The Stone Furnace is receiving iron ore from the Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting from a full chest**: The Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) has reported that the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. To avoid this, regularly check and empty the chest to ensure it can continue mining.\n- **Repeated actions without updates**: The agent has repeatedly refueled the Burner Mining Drill and extracted iron ore from the Wooden Chest without any changes in the state. To optimize actions, ensure that the drill is not repeatedly refueled if it has sufficient fuel and that the extraction is necessary.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (-15, -50)\n  - `wooden_chest_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (-14, -48)\n  - `stone_furnace_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (0, 0)\n  - `iron_ore_count`: int = 38\n  - `iron_plate_count`: int = 61\n  - `coal_count`: int = 4"}
