# nGPT Overview

## What is nGPT?

ðŸ¤– nGPT is a Swiss army knife for LLMs: powerful CLI, interactive chatbot, and flexible library all in one package. Seamlessly work with OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, Claude, Gemini, or any OpenAI-compatible API to generate code, craft git commits, rewrite text, and execute shell commands. Fast, lightweight, and designed for both casual users and developers.

## Architecture

nGPT is built around a few core components:

1. **NGPTClient**: The main class that handles communication with the LLM API endpoints.

2. **Configuration System**: A cross-platform solution for managing API keys, endpoints, and model preferences.

3. **CLI Interface**: A user-friendly command-line interface for direct interaction with LLMs.

4. **Utility Modules**: Helper functions and classes for rendering, text processing, and more.

## Use Cases

nGPT is ideal for:

- Developers who need a simple, lightweight library for integrating LLM capabilities into their Python applications
- Users who want a convenient CLI tool for quick interactions with language models
- Projects that require flexibility to work with different LLM providers
- Applications that need to generate and potentially execute shell commands or code snippets
- Building custom AI-powered command-line tools using the CLI framework capabilities
- Automating tasks like code generation, text rewriting, and documentation generation

## Supported Providers

nGPT works with any provider that offers an OpenAI-compatible API, including:

- OpenAI
- Groq
- Ollama
- Self-hosted models (using compatible API servers)
- Any other service with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
