{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and is currently fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores the extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is aligned to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to a furnace. The inserter is fueled with coal and has a pickup position at (x=-12.5, y=-48.5) and a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it is currently not receiving iron ore due to an issue with the inserter setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (chest) to the destination (furnace). Double-check the pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly set.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Always ensure that there is sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters. This will prevent errors related to insufficient fuel supply.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items and resources before executing actions that require them, such as refueling or inserting items."}
