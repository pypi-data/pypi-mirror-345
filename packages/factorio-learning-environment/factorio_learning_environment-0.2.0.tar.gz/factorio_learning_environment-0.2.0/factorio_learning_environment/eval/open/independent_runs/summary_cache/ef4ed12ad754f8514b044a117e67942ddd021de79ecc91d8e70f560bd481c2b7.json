{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-7.25, -1.0)\nConsists of offshore pump (position(-9.5, -0.5), boiler (position(-7.5, -1.0), and steam engine (position(-4.5, -0.5). The offshore pump is connected to the boiler via a pipe (position(-9.5, -1.5). The boiler is connected to the steam engine. The steam engine is connected to a small electric pole (position(-4.5, -2.5).\n\n### Stone mine at position(-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position(-46.0, 0.0), burner inserter (position(-44.5, 0.5), and wooden chests (positions(-44.5, -0.5) and (-45.5, 1.5). The burner inserter is used to transfer mined stone from the drill to the chests.\n\n### Coal mine at position(16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position(16.0, 0.0) and a wooden chest (position(15.5, -1.5).\n\n### Copper ore mine at position(-46.0, 71.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position(-46.0, 71.0), burner inserter (position(-44.5, 71.5), and wooden chests (positions(-45.5, 72.5). The burner inserter is used to transfer mined copper ore from the drill to the chests.\n\n### Iron ore mine at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position(16.0, 71.0), burner inserter (position(17.5, 71.5), and wooden chests (positions(17.5, 70.5) and (16.5, 72.5). The burner inserter is used to transfer mined iron ore from the drill to the chests.\n\n### Furnace group at positions(-45.0, 3.0), (-41.0,3.0), (-45.0, 74.0), (-41.0, 74.0), (17.0,74.0), and (21.0,74.0)\nConsists of multiple stone furnaces used for smelting ores into plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- Ensure that the chests used for storing mined resources are not full to avoid halting the mining process.\n- Make sure that furnaces have the necessary fuel (coal) and ingredients to smelt. \n- The steam engine is not connected to a power network; ensure it is connected to an electric pole\n- The boiler is out of fuel; ensure a steady supply of coal or other fuel\n- Inserters should be fueled and have a clear path to transfer items\n- Not enough iron plates to craft iron gear wheels\n- Not enough copper plates to craft copper cables\n- Make sure that the agent has the necessary items to craft\n- Ensure that the agent has enough copper plates to craft copper cables\n- Ensure that the agent has enough iron plates to craft iron gear wheels\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- Make sure to the boiler is out of fuel; ensure a steady supply of coal or other fuel. Do not be sure to the boiler\n- Make sure that the agent has a summary of the boiler is not connected to a power network; ensure it is connected to a steam engine\n- Make sure that the boiler is not connected to the steam engine\n- Make sure that the boiler is not connected to the boiler and inserter is not connected to the boiler\n- Make sure that the boiler is not connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is not connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is connected to the boiler is"}
