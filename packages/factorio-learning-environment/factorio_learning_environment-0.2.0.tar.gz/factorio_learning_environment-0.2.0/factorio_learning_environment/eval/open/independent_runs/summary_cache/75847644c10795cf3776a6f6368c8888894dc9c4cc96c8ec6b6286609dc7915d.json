{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Fuel: 7 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Drop position: (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n    - Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing 6 iron ore\n\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: 45 units of coal\n    - Status: Working\n    - Furnace source: 4 iron ore\n    - Furnace result: 69 iron plates\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: 49 units of coal\n    - Status: Working\n    - Furnace source: Empty\n    - Furnace result: 15 iron plates\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: 50 units of coal\n    - Status: No Ingredients\n    - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt, furnace fuel source is full\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (5.5, -60.5)\n  - (7.5, -60.5)\n  - (6.5, -60.5)\n  - (9.5, -60.5)\n  - (8.5, -60.5)\n  - (4.5, -58.5) containing 6 iron ore\n  - (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is emptied regularly to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Regularly check and ensure that furnaces have a sufficient supply of ingredients to maintain continuous production.\n- Monitor the furnace fuel source to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt operations.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore_count: int` - Represents the count of iron ore extracted and inserted into furnaces.\n  - `furnace_fuel: Inventory` - Represents the fuel inventory for each furnace.\n  - `furnace_source: Inventory` - Represents the source inventory for each furnace.\n  - `furnace_result: Inventory` - Represents the result inventory for each furnace."}
