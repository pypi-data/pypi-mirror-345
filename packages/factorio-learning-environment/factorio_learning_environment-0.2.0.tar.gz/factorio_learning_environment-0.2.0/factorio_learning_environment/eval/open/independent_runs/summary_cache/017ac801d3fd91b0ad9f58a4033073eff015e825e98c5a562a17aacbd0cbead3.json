{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with sufficient fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) currently empty.\n  - Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) storing iron plates.\n  - Additional Chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) currently empty.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) waiting for space in destination, connected to the furnace at (x=-12.0, y=-48.0).\n  - Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) working, transferring items from chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to chest at (x=-14.5, y=-46.5).\n  - Inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (x=-10.0, y=-48.0).\n  - Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items, transferring iron plates from furnace to additional chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) have items available for the inserters to transfer. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) have enough space to accommodate items being transferred by inserters. Regularly clear or expand storage to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are continuously supplied with raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to maintain production. Monitor and refill the input inventory of furnaces as needed.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Result Being Full\n- Regularly extract produced items from furnaces to prevent them from reaching full capacity, which halts production. Implement efficient logistics to move items to storage or further processing.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position if placement fails due to existing entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertions\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. Regularly check and manage your inventory to ensure you have the required resources for operations."}
