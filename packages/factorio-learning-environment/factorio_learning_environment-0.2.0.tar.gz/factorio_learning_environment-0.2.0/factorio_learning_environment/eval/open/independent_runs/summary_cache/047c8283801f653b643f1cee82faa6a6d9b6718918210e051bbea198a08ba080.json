Check the input requirements for each furnace and gather the necessary resources before starting operations.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target area.\n\n### Errors related to power supply for lab\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Check the electrical connections and make sure there is sufficient power available for the lab to operate."}
