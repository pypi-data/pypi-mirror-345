{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a transport belt and a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled and actively smelting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n- Transport Belt connecting the wooden chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) to another wooden chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the transport belt to the wooden chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) currently without ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) to the furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) to a wooden chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal and depositing it into a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5).\n- Transport Belt facilitating the movement of coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from halting due to full chests.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Regularly check and refuel inserters to maintain operational efficiency.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the necessary ingredients to ensure continuous production. Check the inventory levels and refill as needed."}
