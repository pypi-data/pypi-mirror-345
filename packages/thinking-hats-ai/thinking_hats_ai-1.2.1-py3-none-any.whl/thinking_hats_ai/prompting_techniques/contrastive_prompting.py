            "- A BAD Response might be: 'Let's throw a huge, impractical party in the White House.\n'"
            "- A BAD Response might be: 'I am always realistic, a party in the white house isn't possible\n'"

            "Using the perspective defined by your current hat, analyze the provided ideas.\n"

            "Explain step-by-step why such ideas are problematic, contrasting them with what would be acceptable or desirable.\n"
            "Finally, propose a revised idea or additional insight that better aligns with your personaâ€™s objectives.\n"
            "Do not say, if you found a bad or good answer. Only respond with your newly generated contribution from your personas hat.\n"
