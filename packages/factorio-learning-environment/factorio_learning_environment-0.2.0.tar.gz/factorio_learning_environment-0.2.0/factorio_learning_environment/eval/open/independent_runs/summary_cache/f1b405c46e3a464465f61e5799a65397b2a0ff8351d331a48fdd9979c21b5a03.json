{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities with fluid system ID 89848\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\n- Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) for storing mined iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for transferring items\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Additional Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Storage and Inventory\n- Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups with various fluid systems and positions, primarily empty\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities being connected are valid and within range. Check that there are no obstructions or misalignments in the intended pipe path.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional power network. Ensure that the electricity network is complete and generating power.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in entities like Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Monitor storage entities such as chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Regularly clear or expand storage as needed."}
