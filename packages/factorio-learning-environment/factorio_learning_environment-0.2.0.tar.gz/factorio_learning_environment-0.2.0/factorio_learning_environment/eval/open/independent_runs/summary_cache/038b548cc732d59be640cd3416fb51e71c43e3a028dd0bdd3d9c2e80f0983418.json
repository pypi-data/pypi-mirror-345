All attempts to place a Lab (intended for supplying Automation Science Packs at position (0.5, 2.5)) have failed, and no Lab exists on the map. While existing furnaces (an iron smelting furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) and a copper smelting furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were retrieved for processing resources, none were built or modified as part of these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n  \u2013 When calling get_entities, avoid supplying unsupported parameters (such as the keyword \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional arguments. Consult the API specification to ensure that only the accepted arguments are used.\n  \n\u2022 Handling None Values\n  \u2013 Validate the return value from functions like get_entities before iterating over them. Implement a fallback (for example, using an empty list if None is returned) to prevent \u201cNoneType is not iterable\u201d errors.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Errors\n  \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab, confirm that a Lab is available in the inventory to avoid placement failures.\n  \u2013 Prior to crafting a Lab, verify that all required sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable, and copper-plate) and their production chains are fully set up. Double-check resource counts and production outputs to ensure that all recipe requirements will be met.\n  \n\u2022 Resource Production Shortfalls\n  \u2013 Ensure that additional smelting and resource conversion processes yield sufficient materials to cover the composite requirements for Lab crafting. Monitor and adjust production steps if ingredient shortages persist."}
