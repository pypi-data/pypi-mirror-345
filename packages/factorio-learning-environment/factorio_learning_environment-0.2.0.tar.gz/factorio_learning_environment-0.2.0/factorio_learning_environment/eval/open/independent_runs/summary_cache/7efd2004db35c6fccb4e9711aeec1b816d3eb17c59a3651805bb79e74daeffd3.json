{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n\nThis structure is designed to extract iron ore and smelt it into iron plates. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore and places it into the stone furnace for smelting. The stone furnace is currently out of ingredients to smelt, indicating that the supply chain might need adjustment to ensure continuous production.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving or placing entities\n- Ensure that the target location for moving or placing an entity is valid and unoccupied before attempting the action. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot move the Stone Furnace to the new location\" and \"Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will avoid errors like \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.5 y=-54.0.\"\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the tile is not already occupied by another entity. This will help avoid errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the drill's drop position.\"\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources or fuel\n- Regularly check and replenish resources and fuel for entities like furnaces and drills to avoid production halts. The burner mining drill is currently out of fuel, and the stone furnace has no ingredients to smelt, which can be resolved by ensuring a steady supply of fuel and raw materials."}
