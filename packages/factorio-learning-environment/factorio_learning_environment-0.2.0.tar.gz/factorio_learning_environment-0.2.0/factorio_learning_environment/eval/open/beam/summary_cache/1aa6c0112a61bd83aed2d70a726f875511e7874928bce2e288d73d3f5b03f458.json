{"content": "It seems that the script is not progressing beyond the initial print statement, \"Starting detailed diagnostic procedure...\". This suggests that there might be an issue early in the execution, possibly related to the retrieval of entities or the environment setup. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Entity Retrieval**: Ensure that the `get_entities` function is correctly implemented and that the entities are present in the game world. If the entities are not being retrieved, the script will not proceed past the initial checks.\n\n2. **Add Debugging Prints**: Add additional print statements immediately after each `get_entities` call to verify that entities are being retrieved correctly. This will help identify which entity retrieval is failing.\n\n3. **Check Environment Setup**: Double-check the setup of your Factorio environment to ensure all entities are correctly placed and accessible. If the environment is not set up correctly, the entities might not be found.\n\n4. **Exception Handling**: Ensure that exceptions are being caught and printed. If an exception is occurring before the assertions, it might not be visible. Double-check the exception handling block to ensure it captures and prints any errors.\n\n5. **Simplify and Test**: Simplify the script to test each part independently. For example, start by just retrieving and printing one type of entity to confirm that part of the script works.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the script with additional debugging prints:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting detailed diagnostic procedure...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Retrieve necessary entities with detailed logging\n    print(\"Retrieving entities...\")\n\n    offshore_pumps = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    print(f\"Offshore Pumps: {offshore_pumps}\")\n\n    boilers = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    print(f\"Boilers: {boilers}\")\n\n    steam_engines = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    print(f\"Steam Engines: {steam_engines}\")\n\n    electric_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    print(f\"Electric Poles: {electric_poles}\")\n\n    assembling_machines = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n    print(f\"Assembling Machines: {assembling_machines}\")\n\n    # Check for presence of entities\n    missing_entities = []\n    if not offshore_pumps:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Offshore Pump\")\n    if not boilers:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Boiler\")\n    if not steam_engines:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Steam Engine\")\n    if not electric_poles:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Electric Pole\")\n    if not assembling_machines:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Assembling Machine\")\n\n    if missing_entities:\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Missing Entities: {', '.join(missing_entities)}\")\n\n    print(\"All necessary entities are confirmed present.\")\n\n    # Continue with further operations if needed...\n\nexcept AssertionError as ae:\n    print(f\"Entity Retrieval Error: {ae}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Unexpected Diagnostic Error: {e}\")\n```\n\nBy adding these debugging statements, you should be able to identify where the script is encountering issues and take appropriate action to resolve them.", "summary_range": "[1-342]"}
