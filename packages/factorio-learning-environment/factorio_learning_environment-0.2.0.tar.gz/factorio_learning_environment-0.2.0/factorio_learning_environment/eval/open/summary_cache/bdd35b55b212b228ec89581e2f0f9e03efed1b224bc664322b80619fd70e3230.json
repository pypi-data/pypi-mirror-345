{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, with a burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding it.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved power connectivity and output handling, though output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), set to craft iron gear wheels, now connected to power network but still lacking iron plates input.\n- Input burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding into the assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) replaced after removal and re-placement to free space.\n- Output burner inserter placed at (25.5, 83.5) and fueled with coal, moving items into output chest.\n- Small electric pole placed near assembler at (25.5, 77.5), connected to power network.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production, now powered and with improved output handling, but still missing sufficient input materials.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failure to place small electric poles near steam engine and furnace due to existing entities occupying target tiles.\n- Attempt to place small electric pole next to steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) failed because a pole already exists at (0.5, 3.5).\n- To avoid these errors, always check tile occupancy before placement.\n- Increase spacing, change direction, or adjust reference position when placing entities near others to find free tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory full or out of fuel issues\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) now consistently fueled and operational.\n- Previously, inserters failed due to full inventory or lack of fuel.\n- Ensure inserters have sufficient fuel and manage their inventories to avoid insertion failures.\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels and avoid overfilling inventories.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) connected to power but still reports missing iron plates (2 units) preventing crafting iron gear wheels.\n- Input and output inventories of the assembling machine remain empty, indicating no materials fed in.\n- To mitigate, ensure required input materials are supplied to assembling machines.\n- Connect assembling machines to power network to enable operation (now done).\n- Manage input materials to assembling machines to meet recipe requirements.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory remains full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Assembling machine output inserter and chest now placed properly to handle output.\n- Ensure output belts and chests are clear and properly connected to accept items.\n- Verify electric poles connect all machines to the power network to ensure operation (now improved).\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent."}
