{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex at (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5) storing iron and copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0) for smelting\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5) moving items from chest to furnace\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing iron and copper plates\n- Additional furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0), (-21.0, -58.0) for parallel smelting\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10.0, -59.0)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) for ore storage\n- Multiple burner inserters moving items between components\n- Transport belt system for item movement\n\n### Smelting Line at (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters moving items between components\n- Transport belt system for output distribution\n\n### Power Generation System at (4.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 20.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5, 22.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting water and steam flow\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Pipe Connection Errors\n- When connecting pipes between boiler and steam engine, ensure there is a valid continuous path\n- Check that pipe endpoints match the connection points of machines\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - ensure regular fuel supply\n- Steam engine not connected to power network - connect with electric poles\n- Several inserters waiting for source items - check input supply and belt connections\n\n### Space and Blockage Issues\n- Mining drills stopped due to full chests - ensure regular emptying of output chests\n- Transport belts blocked at multiple points - clear belt blockages or add more output capacity\n- Inserters unable to output due to blocked destinations - ensure clear paths for item movement\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Multiple entities running out of fuel - implement systematic fuel distribution\n- Keep coal supply steady for burner inserters and mining drills"}
