{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal to a wooden chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) with a warning for full chest at drop position (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) with a warning for being full\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Belt System for Coal Transfer\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5) and outputs from Belt at position (x=43.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter has the necessary items to transfer. Check the supply chain leading up to the inserter to ensure it is not blocked or empty.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are part of the production line to prevent bottlenecks. Consider using additional storage or logistics solutions to manage overflow.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production. Regularly check and replenish the input inventory for furnaces to avoid downtime."}
