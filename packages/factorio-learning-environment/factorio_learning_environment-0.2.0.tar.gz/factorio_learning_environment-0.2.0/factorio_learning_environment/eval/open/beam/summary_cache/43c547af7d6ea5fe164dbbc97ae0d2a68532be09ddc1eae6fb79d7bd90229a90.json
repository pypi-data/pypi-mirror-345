{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-4.5, 18.5)\nThis structure is used to store resources. It contains the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -4.5, 18.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-3.0, 19.0)\nThis structure is used to smelt ores into plates and bricks. It consists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -3.0, 19.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Factory at position(-3.0, 19.0)\nThis structure is an extension of the Stone Furnace and is used to smelt copper ore into copper plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -3.0, 19.0) which is currently processing copper ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. For instance, the Stone Furnace could not be placed at (-4.5, 18.5) due to an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Research the required technology before attempting to craft items that are locked by technology, such as the Stone Wall.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are inserting into does not already contain items that conflict with the insertion. For example, the Stone Furnace could not accept copper ore because it already contained iron ore or vice versa.\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables\n- Make sure all variables used in your code are defined before use. For example, 'remaining_iron_plates' was not defined, which caused an error when trying to insert iron ore.\n\n### Errors when inventory is empty\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For instance, the error occurred because there was no copper ore available to insert into the Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the entity you are inserting into has enough space in its inventory. For example, the Stone Furnace could not accept more items because it was already full."}
