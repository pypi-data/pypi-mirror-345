{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings: 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections'. Status: NOT_CONNECTED.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with warnings: 'out of fuel'. Status: NO_FUEL. Steam output point at position (x=1.5, y=21.5).\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5). Status: WORKING. Connected to pipes at positions (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=-8.5, y=23.5).\n- **Pipe Groups** connecting various entities:\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), status: EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=21.5), status: EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=4.5, y=21.5), status: EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status: FULL_OUTPUT, fluid: water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at various positions (e.g., x=1.5, y=2.5; x=21.5, y=27.5), voltage: 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes. Verify that the path between the connection points is clear of any obstructions.\n- Confirm that the entities being connected are within a valid range and that the connection points are correctly aligned.\n\n### Errors Due to No Input Liquid in Steam Engine\n- Check that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of steam or water. Ensure that the boiler is fueled and operational to provide the necessary steam.\n\n### Errors Due to Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel level in the boiler and ensure it is adequately supplied with fuel to maintain operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect entities using specified prototypes. Recent failures indicate issues with placement blockages and alignment.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: List of connected pipes between entities, currently facing connection issues.\n  - `boiler.steam_output_point`: Position of the steam output point for the boiler, used in connection attempts.\n"}
