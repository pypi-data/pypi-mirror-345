{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-11.5, -3.5) - Now connected but not receiving power\n- **Boiler** at (-8.5, 0.0) - Operational with coal fuel, producing steam (status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n- **Pipe Network** (system 15581):\n  - Connected pipes between pump and boiler\n  - Status: WORKING (fluid flowing)\n\n### New Power Plant (Updated)\n- **Boiler** at (35.5, 47.0) - Fueled with coal but no water input\n- **Steam Engine** at (38.5, 46.5) - Connected to boiler but not operational (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Pipe Network**:\n  - Pipes connecting boiler to steam engine (system 14475)\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Updated)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Powered but not extracting (status: NO_POWER)\n- **Oil Refinery** at (24.5, 44.5) - Powered but missing input resources (status: NO_POWER)\n- **Chemical Plant** at (40.5, 40.5) - Powered but missing resources (status: NO_POWER)\n  - Recipe set to plastic bar production\n  - Requires coal and petroleum gas\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Unchanged)\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at (34.5, 20.5) - Unpowered\n- **Transport Belt System** moving coal (status: WORKING)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Issues (Updated)\n- Boiler status assertion failures - Verify expected status matches actual operational state\n- Refinery power validation errors - Implement proper power network checks before assertions\n- Steam engine connection problems - Validate all connection points before testing status\n\n### Construction Problems (Updated)\n- Small electric pole placement failures (0.0,0.0 and 44.5,40.5) - Clear target area completely before placement\n- Distance-related placement errors - Move within 10 tiles before attempting placement\n- Entity placement inventory checks - Track entity counts before placement attempts\n\n### Fluid System Issues (New)\n- Offshore pump connection validation - Ensure all connection points are unobstructed\n- Pipe network integrity checks - Verify fluid flow paths before testing system status\n- Steam engine input validation - Confirm fluid input before testing operation\n\n### System Validation (Updated)\n1. Always verify inventory before placement operations\n2. Implement complete clearance checks for all constructions\n3. Validate power connections before asserting operational status\n4. Check fluid system integrity after construction\n5. Verify recipe requirements before setting production\n6. Confirm entity positions before interaction attempts\n7. Validate distance requirements before placement operations"}
