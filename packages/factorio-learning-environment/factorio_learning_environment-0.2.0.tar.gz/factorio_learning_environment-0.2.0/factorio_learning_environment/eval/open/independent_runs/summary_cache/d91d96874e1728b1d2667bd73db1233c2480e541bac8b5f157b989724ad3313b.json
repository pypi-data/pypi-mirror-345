{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore (output blocked at belt 15.5,72.5)\n- **Burner inserter** at (17.5, 72.5) moving ore (output blocked)\n- **Transport belt network** connecting drill to furnace (blocked at 15.5,72.5)\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 74.0) for smelting (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-47.5, 74.5) for storage\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) extracting copper ore (working)\n- **Burner inserter** at (-48.5, 72.5) waiting for source items\n- **Transport belt network** connecting drill to furnace\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 74.0) for smelting (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-46.5, 74.5) for storage\n\n#### Power Generation Setup at (-21.5, 70.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-21.5, 70.5) supplying water (working)\n- **Boiler** at (-25.0, 80.5) converting water to steam (fueled)\n- **Steam engine** at (-25.5, 89.5) generating power (working)\n- **Pipe network** connecting components (fluid system 606 for water, 609 for steam)\n\n#### New Power Generation Setup at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) supplying water (working)\n- **Boiler** at (-6.0, 1.5) (not connected)\n- **Steam engine** at (-4.5, 6.5) (not connected)\n- **Attempted pipe connections** between components (failed)\n\n#### Storage Areas\n- **Wooden chest** at (28.5, 74.5)\n- **Burner inserter** at (27.5, 74.5) waiting for source items\n- **Wooden chest** at (-48.5, 75.5)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-46.5, 74.5)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-47.5, 74.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Placement Collisions (7 new instances)\n- Clear existing entities before placing boilers (failed at -10.0,0.0 twice)\n- Verify target position is clear using `get_entities_at()` before placement (failed at 17.5,75.5 for furnace)\n- Check for obstructions before placing steam engines (failed at -7.5,2.0)\n- Remove existing drills before placing new ones (failed at 15.5,70.5)\n\n#### Fluid System Connection Issues (4 new instances)\n- Ensure proper alignment of connection points when connecting pipes (failed at -6.0,1.5 to -4.5,6.5)\n- Verify fluid system compatibility when connecting pipes\n- Clear obstructions in pipe paths before connection attempts (failed at -7.0,1.5 to -2.5,6.5)\n- Check connection directions for offshore pumps and boilers\n\n#### Power Distribution Issues\n- Verify power pole placement covers all electrical entities (multiple drills still without power)\n- Check power network connectivity after placement\n\n#### Existing Issues (from previous report)\n- Clear backed-up transport belts (iron belt at 15.5,72.5)\n- Fuel all furnaces and inserters (multiple entities out of fuel)\n- Verify inserter pickup/drop positions (multiple instances waiting for source items)\n- Maintain proper spacing when placing near existing entities\n\n#### New Recommendations\n- Implement systematic clearing of placement areas before building\n- Develop standardized power plant blueprint with verified connections\n- Create dedicated smelting arrays for plate production\n- Establish monitoring system for power network coverage\n- Implement connection verification checks before finalizing fluid systems"}
