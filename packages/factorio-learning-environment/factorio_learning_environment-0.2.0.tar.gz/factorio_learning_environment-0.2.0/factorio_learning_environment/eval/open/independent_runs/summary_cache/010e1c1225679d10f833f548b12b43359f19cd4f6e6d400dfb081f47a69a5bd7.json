If ingredients are stored remotely (e.g., in a chest), extract them into the inventory prior to crafting.\n- Entity Placement Collisions:\n  - When placing an entity adjacent to an existing structure, ensure the target tile is unoccupied by checking spatial constraints and adjusting placement direction as needed.\n- Improper API Usage for Position Access:\n  - Do not call properties as functions. For instance, use assembly_area.center instead of assembly_area.center() to obtain the buildable area\u2019s position.\n- Inventory Validation Before Placement:\n  - Confirm that the required entity (e.g., the assembling machine) exists in inventory before attempting to place it. If not available, craft or acquire it prior to placement.\n- Technology and Recipe Prerequisites:\n  - Ensure that all necessary technologies (such as automation) have been researched to unlock the corresponding crafting recipes before attempting to craft entities like assembling machines.\n- Missing Sub-Ingredients for Complex Crafts:\n  - Verify that all sub-ingredients (for example, copper plates needed for automation science packs) are producible or already available before initiating multi-component crafting operations."}
