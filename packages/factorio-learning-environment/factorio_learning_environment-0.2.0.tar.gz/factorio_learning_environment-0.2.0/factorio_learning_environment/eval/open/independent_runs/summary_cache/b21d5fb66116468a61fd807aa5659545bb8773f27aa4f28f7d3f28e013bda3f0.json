{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a wooden chest at drop position (x=4.5, y=-58.5).\n- Stone Furnaces at positions:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore supplied.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore supplied.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore supplied.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions:\n  - Chest at position (x=5.5, y=-60.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=7.5, y=-60.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=9.5, y=-60.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=8.5, y=-60.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Chest at position (x=-4.5, y=-52.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-52.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Chest at position (x=-2.5, y=-52.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) empty.\n  - Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) empty.\n  - Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) empty.\n  - Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=-10.5, y=-50.5) empty.\n  - Chest at position (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=-8.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n- Iron Chests at positions:\n  - Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=-52.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) empty.\n  - Chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Error when inserting items into entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and other production facilities. For instance, the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the source inventory has the required items before calling this function.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `furnace`: Represents the furnace entity where items are inserted.\n  - `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory of items, e.g., `{'wooden-chest': 2, 'coal': 10, 'iron-ore': 46, 'iron-plate': 7269, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}`."}
