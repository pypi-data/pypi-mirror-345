{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Offshore Pump at position(x=-16.5, y=26.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position(x=-16.5, y=26.5) and a pipe at position(x=-16.5, y=25.5)\n\n### Boiler at position(x=1.5, y=1.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position(x=1.5, y=1.0) and multiple pipes at various positions\n\n### Boiler at position(x=1.5, y=3.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position(x=1.5, y=3.0) and multiple pipes at various positions\n\n### Pipe Group at position(x=1.5, y=-6.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes at various positions, including (x=1.5,y=-6.5), (x=2.5,y=-6.5), and (x=3.5,y=-6.5)\n\n### Pipe Group at position(x=3.5, y=-2.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes at various positions, including (x=3.5,y=-2.5), (x=5.5,y=-2.5), and (x=4.5,y=-2.5)\n\n### Pipe Group at position(x=-16.5, y=25.5)\nConsists of pipes at positions (x=-16.5,y=25.5) and (x=-15.5,y=25.5)\n\n### Pipe Group at position(x=-12.5, y=25.5)\nConsists of a pipe at position (x=-12.5,y=25.5)\n\n### Pipe Group at position(x=-5.5, y=25.5)\nConsists of a pipe at position (x=-5.5,y=25.5)\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of multiple small electric poles at positions (x=7.5,y=-0.5), (x=7.5,y=2.5), (x=7.5,y=0.5), (x=3.5,y=2.5), and (x=3.5,y=0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when accessing pipe fluid box\n- Ensure that the pipe object has a 'fluid_box' attribute before attempting to access it. The correct attribute name is 'fluid_box', not 'fluidbox'. \n\nNote: There are no other errors reported in the given execution logs. If there were other errors, they would be included in this section."}
