{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities with various positions including (-47.5, -122.5), (-46.5, -121.5), etc.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper-plate output\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with iron-plate output\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no current output\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole and a stone furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at position (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple PipeGroups with various fluid systems and positions, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (-50.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-47.5, -122.5) with water\n- PipeGroup at position (-44.5, -123.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions\n\n### Electricity Network\nElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (1.5, 25.5), (2.5, 24.5), etc.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure that the correct prototype or entity type is available before attempting to place pipes at specific positions. This error occurred multiple times at positions such as (-45.5, -120.5) and (-44.5, -119.5).\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected properly to both the power network and the fluid system. Ensure that there is sufficient input liquid for the steam engine to generate power. This issue was encountered with the assertion error indicating no power generation.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the connections of inserters to the power network. Ensure that the inserter is within the range of a powered electric pole to receive electricity. This was noted for the inserter at position (6.5, -60.5).\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are correctly connected with pipes and that there is a continuous flow of fluid. Warnings indicated issues with no input liquid and no fluid present in connections."}
