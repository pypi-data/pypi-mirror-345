{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Structure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Resources: Iron ore (10,000 units available)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (499 units)\n  - Neighbours: Burner Mining Drill, Burner Inserter\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Out of fuel\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Inventory: Iron plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is properly aligned and positioned to transfer materials between entities. Regularly check the setup to confirm that the inserter is functioning as intended.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel entities like the burner inserter and mining drill to prevent interruptions in operation. Keep a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory. Plan resource gathering accordingly to avoid interruptions in production processes.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Ensure that the inserter is correctly configured to supply the furnace with the required materials."}
