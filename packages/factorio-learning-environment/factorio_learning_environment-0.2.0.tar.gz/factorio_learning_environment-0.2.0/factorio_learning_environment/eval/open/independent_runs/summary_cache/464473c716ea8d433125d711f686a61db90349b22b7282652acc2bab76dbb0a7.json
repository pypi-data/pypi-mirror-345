{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around position 41.0, -82.0)\nComplex structure consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal, facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal from drill\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing LEFT\n  - Second inserter at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Transport belt group starting at (42.5, -81.5) extending right\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n\nThe structure is set up as an automated coal mining and processing line, though currently showing some operational issues with item flow.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing entities - multiple attempts failed due to existing objects blocking placement\n- Check terrain compatibility before placing entities - some placement attempts failed due to unplaceable terrain (water)\n\n### Material Flow Issues\n- Inserter orientation needs careful planning to ensure proper material flow\n- Current setup shows blocked outputs and waiting states, suggesting the material flow path needs optimization\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions align with connected entities (chests, belts, furnaces)\n\n### Entity Status Warnings\n- Address \"output blocked\" warnings by ensuring proper connection between entities\n- \"No ingredients to smelt\" warnings indicate material flow issues to furnace\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner entities to maintain continuous operation\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- chest: Chest\n- furnace: Furnace\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Operating normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Waiting for input\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Output blocked\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Missing required materials\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: No items present (for belts)\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Standard operation (for chests)"}
