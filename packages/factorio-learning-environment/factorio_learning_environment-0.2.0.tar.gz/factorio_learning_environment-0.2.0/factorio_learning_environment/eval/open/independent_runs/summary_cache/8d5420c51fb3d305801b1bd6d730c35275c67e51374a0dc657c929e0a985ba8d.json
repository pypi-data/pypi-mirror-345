{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections between offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the lab\n\n### Laboratory Setup at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n- Connected to the electricity grid with small electric poles\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Resources\n- Ensure you have enough resources before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are required for crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connection\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities, such as pipes and electric poles.\n- Ensure that entities are correctly positioned and connected, especially when setting up power and fluid systems.\n\n### Errors in Code and Naming\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined before use. For example, ensure 'copper_cable_needed_for_poles' is defined before using it in calculations.\n- Ensure correct entity types are used in conditions, such as checking for a 'Lab' entity.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have enough fuel, such as coal, for refueling boilers and other machinery.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that all components of a system are functioning correctly before asserting their status. For example, verify that the steam engine is working before asserting its status.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly verify the status of entities and connections to ensure they are working as expected.\n- Maintain a steady supply of essential resources like coal to avoid interruptions in power generation."}
