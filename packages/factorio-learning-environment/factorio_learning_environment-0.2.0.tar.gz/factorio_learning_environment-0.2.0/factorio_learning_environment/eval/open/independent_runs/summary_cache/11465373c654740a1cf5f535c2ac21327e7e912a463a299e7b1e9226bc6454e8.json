{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with coal inventory.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is currently working and requires coal for operation. It is connected to the Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for resource extraction.\n\n### Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently working and requires coal and iron ore for operation.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting coal into the furnace without ingredients**:\n  - Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients before attempting to refuel it. The furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) reported \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" after refueling attempts.\n\n- **Errors when inserting coal into the burner mining drill**:\n  - Ensure that the burner mining drill is not already full of fuel before inserting more coal. The burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) is working but may have limited capacity.\n\n- **Errors related to the wooden chest being full**:\n  - The burner mining drill has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (41.5, -80.5) is full. Regularly empty the chest to allow for continuous mining.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int (value: 2435)\n  - `iron-ore`: int (value: 16)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (value: 621)\n  - `wood`: int (value: 6)"}
