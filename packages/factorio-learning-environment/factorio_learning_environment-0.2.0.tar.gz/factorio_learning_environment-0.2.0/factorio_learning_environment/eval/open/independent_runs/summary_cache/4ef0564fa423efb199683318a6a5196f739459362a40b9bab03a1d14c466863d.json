{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these components, with pipes at positions such as (-47.5, -122.5), (-46.5, -121.5), (-45.5, -120.5), etc.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connecting to a wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Small Electric Poles providing power connections\n\n### Storage and Processing Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple pipe groups exist across the map, including:\n- Pipe Group at position (-50.5, -122.5)\n- Pipe Group at position (-47.5, -122.5) with water\n- Pipe Group at position (-45.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe Group at position (-48.5, -120.5)\n- Additional pipe groups scattered throughout the map\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions such as (4.5, -58.5), (9.5, -59.5), etc., currently not providing power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing pipes is free of other entities. Remove any existing entities before attempting to place a new pipe.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to a functional power network and receiving the necessary input liquid. Ensure all connections are properly established and the engine is supplied with steam.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check that the inserter is connected to a powered electric network. Ensure all electric poles are correctly placed and connected to a power source.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the required ingredients for smelting. Check the inventory and supply the necessary materials to the furnaces.\n\n### Boiler Not Connected to Input Liquid\n- Make sure that the boiler is properly connected to a water source and that the fluid system is functioning correctly. Check for any disconnections or blockages in the pipe network."}
