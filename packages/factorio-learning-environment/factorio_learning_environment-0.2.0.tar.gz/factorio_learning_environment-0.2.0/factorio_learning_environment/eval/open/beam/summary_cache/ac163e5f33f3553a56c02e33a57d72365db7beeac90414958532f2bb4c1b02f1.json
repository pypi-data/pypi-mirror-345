{"content": "I see the issue now. We cannot craft an iron chest because it requires a specific crafting machine, and we don't have access to one. Let's modify our approach to use transport belts since we have 39 of them in our inventory.\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Get the mining drill reference\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Found drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Get the drill's drop position\ndrop_pos = drill.drop_position\nprint(f\"Drill drop position: {drop_pos}\")\n\n# Place a series of transport belts from the drill's output\nbelt_positions = [\n    Position(x=drop_pos.x + 1, y=drop_pos.y),\n    Position(x=drop_pos.x + 2, y=drop_pos.y),\n    Position(x=drop_pos.x + 3, y=drop_pos.y)\n]\n\n# Place the belts\nfor pos in belt_positions:\n    belt = place_entity(\n        Prototype.TransportBelt,\n        position=pos,\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT\n    )\n    print(f\"Placed belt at: {belt.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to the drill if needed\nif drill.status == EntityStatus.NO_FUEL:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n\n# Verify setup\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\n```\n\nThis script will:\n1. Use our existing transport belts instead of trying to craft a chest\n2. Create a belt line from the drill's output\n3. Ensure the drill has fuel\n4. Set up automated transport of mined resources\n\nWould you like me to try this approach instead?", "summary_range": "[1-2762]"}
