{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting from position (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from chests\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect belts. Direct connections from chests to belts are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting actions like inserting items or placing entities. Gather necessary resources beforehand.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing raw resources\n- Ensure that all raw resources required for crafting are gathered first. For example, wood must be harvested before crafting wooden chests."}
