{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1**: Stone furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input.\n- **Furnace 2**: Stone furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**: Positioned at (x=-13.5, y=-47.5), (x=-14.5, y=-45.5), (x=-13.5, y=-45.5), (x=-11.5, y=-45.5), (x=-9.5, y=-44.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-43.5), these inserters manage the movement of items between furnaces, chests, and belts.\n- **Wooden Chests**: Positioned at (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-44.5), used for storing iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest**: Positioned at (x=-11.5, y=-44.5), used for storing iron plates.\n- **Belt Groups**: Connect the furnaces and chests, facilitating the movement of iron plates between entities.\n\n### Electricity Generator\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Boiler**: Positioned at (x=-7.0, y=23.5), currently out of fuel.\n- **Steam Engine**: Positioned at (x=-3.5, y=23.5), not connected due to lack of input liquid.\n- **Offshore Pump**: Positioned at (x=-9.5, y=24.5), supplying water to the boiler.\n- **Pipe Group**: Connects the offshore pump to the boiler, ensuring water supply.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- **Belt Group 1**: Inputs at (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) and outputs at (x=-8.5, y=-43.5), moving iron plates.\n- **Belt Group 2**: Inputs at (x=-12.5, y=-44.5) and outputs at (x=-11.5, y=-46.5), currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities such as boilers or furnaces.\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and inserters to avoid interruptions in production and power generation. Keep a steady supply of coal or other fuels in your inventory.\n\n### Errors with fluid connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established between offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines to maintain a continuous flow of water and steam.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check the connected belts and chests for the presence of required items."}
