Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity type is correct.\n\n### Errors with Managing Full Inventory\n- When managing full inventories, ensure you are passing the correct entity or entity group. Avoid passing incorrect data types like positions.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Ensure all entities that require power are properly connected to the power network. Check connections and ensure there are no missing links in the power grid.\n\n### Errors with Inserter and Lab Connectivity\n- Verify that inserters and labs are correctly connected to the power network to ensure they receive electricity. Check for any missing or misaligned connections."}
