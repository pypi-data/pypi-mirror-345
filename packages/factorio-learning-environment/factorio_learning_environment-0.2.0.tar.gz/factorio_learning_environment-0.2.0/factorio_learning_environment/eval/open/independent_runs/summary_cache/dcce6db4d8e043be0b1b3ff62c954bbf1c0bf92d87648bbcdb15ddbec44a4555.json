{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining System (around position -8, -59)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row mining iron ore:\n- First drill at (-10.0, -59.0) with wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Second drill at (-8.0, -59.0) with wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Third drill at (-6.0, -59.0) with attempted output at (-5.5, -57.5)\n\n### Coal Storage System (around position 3, -2.5)\nFour wooden chests storing coal:\n- Chest at (0.5, -2.5) containing 40 coal\n- Chest at (2.5, -2.5) containing 40 coal\n- Chest at (4.5, -2.5) containing 40 coal\n- Chest at (6.5, -2.5) containing 40 coal\n\n### Iron Smelting Line (around position 3, 0)\nComplex smelting system consisting of:\n- Four furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Four burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving items from coal storage to furnaces\n- Four output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- Additional burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5) and (7.5, 0.5) for output handling\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place them (attempted to place wooden chest without having one)\n- Remove existing entities before placing new ones in the same position (had to remove incorrectly placed furnace)\n\n### Mining system efficiency issues\n- Ensure all mining drills have proper output collection (third drill has blocked output)\n- Keep mining drills fueled to maintain continuous operation (third drill has no fuel)\n- Place collection entities (chests/furnaces) at the correct drop positions to prevent item blockage\n\n### Resource management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to prevent work stoppage\n- Ensure proper connection between input and output entities to maintain production flow"}
