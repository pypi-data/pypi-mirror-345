A water supply connection to the new Boiler was also attempted but encountered errors.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at position (x=1.5, y=19.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Assembling Machine at (x=1.5, y=19.5) reconfigured for Iron Gear Wheel production.\n\u2022 Burner Inserter at (x=1.5, y=17.5).\n\u2022 Input Chest at (x=2.5, y=17.5).\n\u2022 Output Chest at (x=1.5, y=21.5).\n\u2022 Dedicated Copper Buffer Chest at (x=-5.5, y=21.5).\n\u2022 Dedicated Transport Belt Segment at (x=0.5, y=17.5).\n\u2022 Additional Burner Inserters at (x=2.5, y=16.5) and (x=3.5, y=17.5).\n\n### Copper Extraction System (adjacent to the copper smelting furnace)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Extraction Burner Inserter at (x=-3.5, y=23.5) with pickup at (x=-3.5, y=22.5) and drop at (x=-3.5, y=24.5).\n\u2022 Copper Buffer Chest at (x=-3.5, y=26.5).\n\u2022 Chest Extraction Burner Inserter at (x=-3.5, y=27.5) with pickup at (x=-3.5, y=26.5) and drop at (x=-3.5, y=28.5).\n\u2022 Belt Source Inserter at (x=-3.5, y=25.5).\n\n### Extraction Belt Depot at position (x=3.5, y=15.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Wooden Chest at (x=3.5, y=15.5) serving as the belt depot.\n\u2022 Dedicated Transport Belt Segment at (x=4.5, y=15.5) for copper plate conveyance.\n\u2022 Depot Burner Inserter at (x=3.5, y=14.5) with pickup at (x=3.5, y=15.5) and drop at (x=3.5, y=13.5).\n\n### Belt Connection Target Setup for Copper Extraction\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Extraction Source: Wooden Chest at (x=3.5, y=15.5).\n\u2022 Extraction Inserter at (x=4.5, y=15.5) with pickup at (x=3.5, y=15.5) and drop at (x=5.5, y=15.5).\n\u2022 Manual Transport Belt Chain comprising horizontal segments (e.g. at x=7.5, x=8.5 along y=15.5) and vertical segments (from y=14.5 down to y=11.5, with noted blockages).\n\u2022 New Target Inserter at (x=8.5, y=9.5) with pickup at (x=8.5, y=10.5) and drop at (x=8.5, y=8.5).\n\u2022 Belt Chain Burner Inserter Refueling Subsystem with burner inserters at various positions.\n\n### Remote Fluid Integration System at remote region (approximate center: x=-30, y=40)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Offshore Pump at (x=-30.5, y=37.5) operating (status: WORKING).\n\u2022 Boiler at (x=-29.0, y=33.5) for fluid heating.\n\u2022 Pipe Connection established via a PipeGroup starting at (x=-30.5, y=31.5) through (x=-30.5, y=34.5) in sequential segments.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Pipe Crafting and Resource Shortage:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that sufficient sub-ingredients (such as iron plates) are available before initiating pipe crafting. The repeated crafting failures indicate that production of required iron plates must be carefully supported by smelting operations or available crafting machinery.\n\n\u2022 Fluid Connection Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the pipe inventory meets the requirements (e.g., 33 pipes) prior to attempting fluid connections.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that both source and target connection points are clear and properly aligned along the intended fluid path.\n\u2003\u2013 Reassess intermediate positions to avoid obstructions; despite an eventual attempt yielding a positive connection message, the new Boiler and Steam Engine remain unintegrated.\n\n\u2022 Water Supply Connection Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid calling Position objects as functions to prevent TypeError issues; ensure proper syntax when accessing attributes.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate the pathfinding process from the current player position (e.g., x=-1.5, y=18.5) to the water source (e.g., x=-26.0 to x=-26.5, y\u224860.25) to resolve routing errors.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that water source positions are accurately determined and reachable to establish a stable water supply connection.\n\n\u2022 Network Stabilization and Connection Reevaluation:\n\u2003\u2013 Allow sufficient stabilization time after connection attempts before reassessing system status.\n\u2003\u2013 Double-check inventory levels and positional data prior to reattempting both fluid and water connections.\n\nAdditional general guidelines on placement accuracy, resource management, and entity retrieval from previous operations remain applicable."}
