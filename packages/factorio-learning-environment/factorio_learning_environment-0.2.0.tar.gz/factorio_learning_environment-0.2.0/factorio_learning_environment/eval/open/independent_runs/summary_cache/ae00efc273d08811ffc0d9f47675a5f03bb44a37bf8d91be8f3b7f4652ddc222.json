Its role is to receive materials from the extraction process and feed them into the belt\u2010network.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Approximately Position(x = 2.5, y = 17.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A cable input chest located at Position(x = 2.5, y = 17.5)\n\u2013 A burner inserter placed at Position(x = 3.5, y = 17.5) (used with direction RIGHT)\n\u2013 An additional burner inserter at Position(x = 1.5, y = 17.5) (fuelled with coal)\n\u2013 A further burner inserter at Position(x = 2.5, y = 16.5) (oriented UP)\n\u2013 An assembling machine at Position(x = 1.5, y = 19.5)\nThis structure is designed to process inputs for the production of copper cable through seamless transfer between its components.\n\n### Belt Depot at Position(x = 3.5, y = 15.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A wooden chest placed at Position(x = 3.5, y = 15.5) serving as the depot basis\n\u2013 An adjacent transport belt segment at Position(x = 4.5, y = 15.5)\n\u2013 A depot burner inserter positioned at Position(x = 3.5, y = 14.5) whose pickup aligns with the chest\nThis depot serves as an isolated belt target, intended to collect items from the extraction system before routing them onward.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position(x = -0.5, y = 24.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A steam engine (generator) at Position(x = -0.5, y = 24.5)\n\u2013 A boiler at Position(x = -5.5, y = 24.0)\n\u2013 An offshore pump at Position(x = -7.5, y = 25.5)\nThis grouping provides electrical power by converting water into steam that drives the generator.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Belt Connection Errors\n  \u2013 When connecting transport belts, never target a SteamEngine directly. Always introduce an inserter that inputs items into the SteamEngine so that belts are connected to a valid target.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Issues\n  \u2013 Before placing an entity (for example, a wooden chest), ensure the player is within the allowed maximum distance of the target position to avoid placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Problems\n  \u2013 Verify that all variables (such as the reference for target_chest) are properly defined and consistently referenced to avoid NameError exceptions.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortages\n  \u2013 Check that the required entity (for instance, wooden-chest) is present in the inventory before attempting a placement action."}
