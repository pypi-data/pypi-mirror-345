{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) which manage the transfer of materials between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions for storing the smelted iron plates, including:\n  - (-14.5, -46.5) for primary storage.\n  - (-6.5, -47.5), (-7.5, -47.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) for secondary, tertiary, and quaternary storage, respectively.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Overflow Errors\n- Ensure that storage chests have enough capacity before inserting items. Consider monitoring chest capacities and transferring items to additional storage when nearing capacity.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities for inserters are adequately stocked with items to prevent waiting states. Regularly check and replenish resources as needed.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to avoid idle states. Maintain a steady flow of resources from mining drills to furnaces.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly monitor and manage storage chests to prevent them from becoming full. Implement overflow management strategies, such as transferring excess items to additional storage chests."}
