{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting copper ore\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Storage Facilities\n- Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab with input for automation science packs\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups for fluid transport, with some empty and others active\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting to Power Network\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect structures to the power network. In this case, ensure you have enough Small Electric Poles.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure all sub-ingredients are available before crafting. For Small Electric Poles, ensure you have enough Copper Plates, which require smelting Copper Ore in a Furnace.\n\n### Errors with Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting placement."}
