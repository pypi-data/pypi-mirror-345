Check the surrounding area for any entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors related to power connection\n- Make sure all power-generating entities (like steam engines and boilers) are properly connected to a power network. Check for any warnings indicating that they are not connected.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
