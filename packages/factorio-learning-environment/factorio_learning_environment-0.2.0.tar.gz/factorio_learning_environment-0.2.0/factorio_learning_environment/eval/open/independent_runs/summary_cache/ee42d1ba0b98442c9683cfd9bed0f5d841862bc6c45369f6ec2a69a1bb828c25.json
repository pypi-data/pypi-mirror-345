{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine and Smelter at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position: 16.0, 71.0)\n- Wooden chest (position: 16.5, 72.5) to collect iron ore\n- Stone furnace (position: 18.0, 73.0) to smelt iron ore\n- Burner inserter (position: 19.5, 73.5) to transfer iron plates from furnace to a new wooden chest at position (20.5, 73.5)\n- Burner inserter (position: 15.5, 72.5) to transfer iron ore from chest to furnace\n- Wooden chest (position: 20.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to other entities with insufficient spacing\n- Ensure there is sufficient spacing between entities when placing them next to each other. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction of placement.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to place entities at occupied positions\n- Check if the target position is occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into furnace without having the required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace.\n\n#### Common issues with entity placement\n- Be aware of nearby entities that might be blocking the placement of new entities. Consider changing the direction or reference position of the entity being placed.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from an empty chest\n- Check if the chest contains the required items before attempting to extract them.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from the wrong type of entity\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from is of the correct type and contains the required items.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full inserter inventory\n- Check if the inserter's inventory is full before attempting to insert more items. Ensure that the inserter has enough space to hold the items.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full chest\n- Check if the chest is full before attempting to insert more items. Ensure that the chest has enough space to hold the items.\n\n#### Errors when burner mining drill's output chest is full\n- Ensure that the output chest has enough space to hold the mined items. Empty the chest regularly to avoid this issue.\n\n#### Errors when inserter cannot find a nearby entity to insert items into\n- Ensure that there is a valid entity nearby that can accept the items being inserted.\n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them in the code.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- `chest`: Wooden chest entity at position (16.5, 72.5) of type `Entity`\n- `furnace`: Stone furnace entity at position (18.0, 73.0) of type `Entity`\n- `inserter`: Burner inserter entity at position (19.5, 73.5) of type `Entity`\n- `new_inserter`: Burner inserter entity at position (15.5, 72.5) of type `Entity`\n- New wooden chest entity at position (20.5, 73.5) of type `Entity` (not assigned to a specific variable)\n\nNew warnings and issues observed:\n- The burner inserter at position (15.5, 72.5) is waiting for space in the destination and has warnings for a full chest and output blocked by an item on the ground.\n- The burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\nThese issues are related to existing error tips, specifically:\n- Errors when inserting items into a full chest\n- Errors when burner mining drill's output chest is full\n- Errors when inserter cannot find a nearby entity to insert items into\n\nNo new error tips are added, as the observed issues are already covered by the existing tips."}
