{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a warning: \"chest at drop position is full\"\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) with a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) and (42.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5), working and transferring items between entities\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a warning: \"chest at drop position is full\"\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Multiple Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-13.5, -49.5)\n- Burner Inserters facilitating item movement between entities\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Iron Chests at various positions storing iron plates and other resources\n- Burner Inserters at positions such as (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), (-8.5, -44.5) for transferring items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from chests with insufficient inventory\n- Ensure that the chest contains the required quantity of items before attempting to extract. Check the inventory of the chest to confirm availability.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to prevent mining and production stoppages. Consider setting up automated systems to manage inventory levels.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If the source is empty, refuel or restock it to maintain production flow."}
