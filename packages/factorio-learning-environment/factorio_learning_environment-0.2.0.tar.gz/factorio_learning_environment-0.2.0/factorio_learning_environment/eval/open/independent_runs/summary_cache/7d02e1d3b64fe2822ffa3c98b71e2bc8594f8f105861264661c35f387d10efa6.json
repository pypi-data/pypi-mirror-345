{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (2.0, -63.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (2.0, -63.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (4.0, -63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, -61.5): Collects iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (3.5, -61.5): Additional storage for iron ore or other items.\n\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and store the output in chests for further use.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to place entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like **Burner Mining Drill** or **Wooden Chest**.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid locations\n- Check the target location for obstacles or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water) before placing entities like **Burner Mining Drill**.\n- Ensure the target location is within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from the player.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients or crafting machines\n- Crafting items like **Burner Mining Drill** requires sub-ingredients (e.g., iron plates). Ensure you have the necessary materials and access to a crafting machine or furnace.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities without the required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items (e.g., coal) in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like **Burner Mining Drill** or **Stone Furnace**.\n\n#### Errors when connecting chests directly with belts\n- Use an **Inserter** to transfer items between **Wooden Chests** instead of attempting to connect them directly with belts.\n\n#### Errors when the chest at the drop position is full\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the **Burner Mining Drill** to avoid interruptions in mining operations."}
