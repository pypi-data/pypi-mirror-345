There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the desired location is unoccupied before placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the target location for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is valid and unoccupied.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors such as \"No entity of type stone-furnace found at the specified position.\"\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that the required resources, such as coal, are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like drills.\n\n### Output blockage warnings\n- Address warnings related to output blockage by ensuring there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills or other production entities."}
