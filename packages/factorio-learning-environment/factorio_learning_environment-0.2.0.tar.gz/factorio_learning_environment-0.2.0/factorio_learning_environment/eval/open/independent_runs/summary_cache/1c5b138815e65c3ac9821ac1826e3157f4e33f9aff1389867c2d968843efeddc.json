{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron plates and coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-22.0, -67.0) and (-21.0, -62.0) for smelting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-24.5, -67.5), (-21.5, -65.5), and (-16.5, -64.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) for item transfer.\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities for item transportation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing object at the target location before placing a new entity. For example, a transport belt could not be placed at (-21.5, -65.5) due to an existing wooden chest.\n\n### NameError due to Undefined Classes\n- Ensure that all necessary classes and modules are imported and defined before use. For instance, the error \"NameError: name 'Chest' is not defined\" suggests that the class 'Chest' was not properly imported or defined in the script."}
