{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Power Generation System (Incomplete/Not Working)\nLocated around position (-9.5, 24.5) to (-4.5, 14.5), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Water pipe system from (-7.5, 24.5) to (-4.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 14.5)\nSystem is not functioning due to connection issues.\n\n###Manufacturing Area\nLocated around (23.5, 2.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 for crafting inserters\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 2.5) containing 36 inserters\n- Output wooden chest at (26.5, 2.5)\n- Two burner inserters at (21.5, 2.5) and (25.5, 2.5) for automation\n\n###Science Pack Production\nLocated at (32.5, 5.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 for crafting logistic science packs\n\n###Basic Smelting Setup\nMultiple furnaces at:\n- (0.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 0.0) containing 2 iron plates\n- (4.0, 4.0) with coal fuel\n- (6.0, 4.0)\n\n###Research Labs\nMultiple labs spread across the map, currently not powered but containing:\n- Lab 1: 1 automation science pack, 4 logistic science packs\n- Lab 2: 1 automation science pack, 4 logistic science packs\n- Lab 3: 2 automation science pack, 2 logistic science packs\n- Lab 4: 2 automation science packs\n- Lab 5: 40 logistic science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Errors with pipe placement near water\n- Keep minimum 1 tile distance from water tiles when placing pipes\n- Avoid placing pipes or underground pipes directly adjacent to water tiles\n- Use proper orientation when connecting to offshore pumps\n\n###Entity placement conflicts\n- Always check if target position is clear before placing new entities\n- Remove existing entities at target position before placing new ones\n- Use get_entity() to verify if position is occupied before placement\n\n###Power system connection issues\n- Ensure proper fluid connections between offshore pump, boiler and steam engine\n- Verify pipe connections are continuous without gaps\n- Check entity orientations match the intended flow direction\n- Remove all existing pipes before rebuilding to avoid connection conflicts\n\n###Electric network issues\n- All powered entities show NO_POWER status\n- Ensure proper connection between power producers (steam engine) and consumers\n- Verify electric pole connections form a continuous network"}
