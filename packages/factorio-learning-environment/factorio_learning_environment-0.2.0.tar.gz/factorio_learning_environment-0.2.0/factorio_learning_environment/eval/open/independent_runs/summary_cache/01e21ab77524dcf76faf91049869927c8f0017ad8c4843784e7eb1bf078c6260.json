{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe Group (fluid system 10253) connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Small Electric Poles surrounding the steam engine for power distribution\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connecting to a wooden chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Laboratory Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure pipes are correctly aligned and there are no blockages in the intended path. Check for any misplaced entities that might be obstructing the connection.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Pole Connections\n- Verify that electricity poles are within range of each other and correctly connected to form a continuous network. Ensure no nil values are being referenced in the connection logic.\n\n### No Fluid Present in Boiler Connections\n- Confirm that the pipe network is correctly set up to transport fluid from the offshore pump to the boiler. Check for any disconnections or incorrect pipe placements.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that the boiler is receiving water and fuel. Check the fluid and energy connections thoroughly to resolve any issues."}
