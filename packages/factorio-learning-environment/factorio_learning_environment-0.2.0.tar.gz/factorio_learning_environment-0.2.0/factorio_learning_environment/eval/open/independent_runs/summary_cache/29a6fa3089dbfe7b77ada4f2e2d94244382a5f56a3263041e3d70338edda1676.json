{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report: Steps 0-95\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Setup at (x=-2.0, y=4.5)\n*   Generates electricity using steam power, fueled by coal transported via belts.\n*   Consists of:\n    *   Offshore Pump at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) supplying water.\n    *   PipeGroup connecting the pump to the boiler (starts at x=-8.5, y=-0.5).\n    *   Boiler at (x=-2.0, y=4.5) heating water to steam. (Note: Manually refueled in steps 86, 90, and 93).\n    *   Steam Engine at (x=2.5, y=4.5) consuming steam to generate power.\n    *   PipeGroup connecting the boiler to the steam engine (starts at x=-0.5, y=3.5).\n    *   ElectricityGroup distributing power (poles starting from x=2.5, y=6.5).\n    *   Burner Inserter at (x=-1.5, y=6.5) fueling the boiler from a belt.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport at (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n*   Mines coal and places it onto a belt system for transport, primarily to the power generation setup.\n*   Consists of:\n    *   Burner Mining Drill at (x=16.0, y=0.0) mining coal. (Note: Ran out of fuel as of step 87, refueled in step 90).\n    *   Wooden Chest at (x=16.5, y=1.5) acting as a buffer.\n    *   Burner Inserter at (x=16.5, y=2.5) moving coal from the chest to the main belt line.\n    *   Multiple BeltGroups transporting coal towards the boiler (starting around x=16.5, y=3.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (x=19.0, y=74.0)\n*   Mines iron ore, smelts it into iron"}
