{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a result inventory containing iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and resources containing iron ore. \n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which is currently full with iron ore.\n  \n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when feeding items into the Stone Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace is not full before attempting to feed items into it. The furnace result inventory is currently full.\n\n### Errors when refueling the Burner Mining Drill\n- When refueling, ensure that the drill has enough capacity to accept fuel. The drill is operational but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full, which may affect mining operations.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. The wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) is currently full and may need to be emptied to allow for further mining.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked.\n\n#### Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron_plate`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `burner_mining_drill_position`: tuple (float, float)\n- `stone_furnace_position`: tuple (float, float)\n- `wooden_chest_position`: tuple (float, float)"}
