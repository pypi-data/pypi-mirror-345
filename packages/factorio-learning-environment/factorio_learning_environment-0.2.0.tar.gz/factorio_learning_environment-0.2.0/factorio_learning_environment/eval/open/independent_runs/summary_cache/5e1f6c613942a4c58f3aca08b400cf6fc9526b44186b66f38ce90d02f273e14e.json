{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of mined ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) for transferring ore from the chests to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is currently experiencing full output warnings, indicating that the output is not being cleared fast enough.\n- **Additional Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) which is currently not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage Area\nThis area is used for storing iron plates produced by the furnaces. It consists of:\n- **Multiple Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), and (-6.5, -47.5) for storing iron plates. Some of these chests are full, indicating a need for better storage management.\n\n#### Iron Plate Transfer System\nThis system is responsible for transferring iron plates to storage and consists of:\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-11.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) for moving iron plates from furnaces to storage chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-10.5, -46.5) and (-7.5, -47.5) for receiving iron plates from inserters.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Storage Management Issues\n- **No space available for new storage chests**: Consider rearranging or optimizing the current storage setup to make space for additional chests. Ensure that existing chests are not full to avoid production bottlenecks.\n\n#### Inserter Operation Errors\n- **Inserter waiting for source items**: Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. This may involve ensuring that the furnaces are operational and producing items.\n- **Furnace belt at drop position is blocked**: Ensure that the output from the furnaces is being cleared efficiently to prevent blockage. This may involve adding more storage capacity or improving the transfer rate to storage chests.\n\n#### Furnace Operation Warnings\n- **Furnace result is full**: Ensure that the output from the furnaces is being cleared efficiently to prevent production halts. Consider adding more storage or improving the transfer rate to existing storage solutions.\n- **No ingredients to smelt**: Ensure that the furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production. This may involve improving the supply chain from mining drills to furnaces."}
