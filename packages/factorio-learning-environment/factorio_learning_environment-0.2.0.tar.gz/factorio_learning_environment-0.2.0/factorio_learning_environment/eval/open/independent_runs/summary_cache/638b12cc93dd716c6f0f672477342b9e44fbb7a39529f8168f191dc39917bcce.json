{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The execution logs indicate that the agent attempted to place several entities, but all placement attempts failed. As a result, there are no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest, Stone Furnace, Inserters, and Output Chest**: Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity being placed. Verify that there is enough space and that the terrain supports the entity type.\n\n### Errors related to movement\n- **Error moving to areas**: Ensure that the position object is correctly referenced and callable. Double-check the syntax and data types used in movement commands to avoid errors such as \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" and \"'Position' object is not callable.\"\n\n### Errors with BuildingBox\n- **No viable place for Wooden Chest with BuildingBox**: Adjust the size of the BuildingBox or use multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to find a suitable placement area. Ensure that the specified center position is valid and accessible.\n\nThese tips should help in mitigating the errors encountered during the execution steps and facilitate successful placement and movement in future actions."}
