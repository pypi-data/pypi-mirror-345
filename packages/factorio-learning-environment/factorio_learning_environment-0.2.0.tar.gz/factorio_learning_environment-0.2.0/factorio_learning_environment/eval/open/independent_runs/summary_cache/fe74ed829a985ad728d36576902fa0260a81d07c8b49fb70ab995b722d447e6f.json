{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (39,998 units)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without checking inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them. This will prevent errors like \"Cannot place [Entity] at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- Double-check the positions and existence of entities before attempting to interact with them. For example, ensure that a Stone Furnace is present at the specified location before trying to get or move it.\n\n### Errors when output is blocked\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills or other production entities to prevent output blockage.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients\n- Make sure that all necessary ingredients are available for the production processes in furnaces or assembling machines to avoid production halts."}
