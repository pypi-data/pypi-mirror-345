{"content": "# The setup is complete! We have:\n- 40 units of coal remaining in the inventory.\n- Two stone furnaces are operational, each with 4 units of coal as fuel and 9 units of iron ore ready to be smelted.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Monitor Smelting Process**: We should wait for the furnaces to finish smelting the iron ore into iron plates. \n2. **Check Inventory**: After a certain period, we will check the inventory to see how many iron plates have been produced.\n\n### 1. Wait for Smelting\nWe will wait for a maximum of 30 seconds to see if the furnaces produce the iron plates. \n\n### 2. Check Inventory After Waiting\n```python\n# Wait for smelting process\nfor _ in range(30):  # Maximum wait time of 30 seconds\n    if inspect_inventory()[Prototype.IronPlate] >= 10:  # Check if we have at least 10 iron plates\n        break\n    sleep(1)\nelse:\n    raise Exception(\"Smelting timeout - check fuel and inputs\")\n\n# Check the inventory after the wait\nprint(f\"Final Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis will allow us to confirm the successful smelting of iron plates and check the final inventory status.", "summary_range": "[1-10]"}
