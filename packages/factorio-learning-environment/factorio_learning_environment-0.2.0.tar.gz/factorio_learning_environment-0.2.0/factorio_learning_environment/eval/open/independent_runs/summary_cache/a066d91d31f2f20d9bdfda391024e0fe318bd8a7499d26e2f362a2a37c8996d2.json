{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a transport belt at (x=39.5, y=-83.5) and a wooden chest at (x=40.5, y=-83.5). The chest is used for collecting mined coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest at (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n- Transport belt system connecting various entities.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) supplied with copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest at (x=12.5, y=0.5).\n- Transport belt system connecting various entities.\n\n### Intermediate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=2.5, y=0.5), (x=7.5, y=0.5), and (x=12.5, y=0.5) used for storing intermediate products like iron plates and copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with missing entities\n- Double-check the position and existence of entities before attempting to interact with them. For example, ensure that a wooden chest exists at the specified position before trying to access it."}
