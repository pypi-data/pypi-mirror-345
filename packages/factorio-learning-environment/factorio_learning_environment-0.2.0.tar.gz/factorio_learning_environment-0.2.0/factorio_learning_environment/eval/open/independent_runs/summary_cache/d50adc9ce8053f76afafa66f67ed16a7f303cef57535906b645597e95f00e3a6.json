{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore and transferring it to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=0.5) intended to refuel the stone furnace with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned with both its source and destination entities. The pickup and drop positions should be correctly set to facilitate the transfer of items.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Items\n- Verify that the source entity (e.g., chest) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and fueled.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the setup of the inserter feeding the furnace. Make sure the inserter is correctly aligned and operational, and that the chest contains iron ore.\n\n### Refueling Issues\n- Maintain an adequate supply of fuel (coal) in your inventory to ensure continuous operation of inserters and mining drills. Regularly check and refuel entities as needed.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly monitor inventory levels in source entities to prevent downtime."}
