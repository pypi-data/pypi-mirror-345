{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at (15.5, 70.5) - UPDATED\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) now powered and operational (producing 42 iron ore per minute)\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 73.5) now contains 52 iron ore\n- Small electric pole at (13.5, 70.5) now properly connected\n- Stone furnace moved to (16.0, 76.0) (still unfueled)\n- Burner inserter added at (15.5, 74.5) (fueled with 9 coal)\n- Transport belt path remains from drill to chest (17.5, 72.5 to 25.5, 72.5)\n\n### Power generation setup at (-9.5, -0.5) - UPDATED\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) operational\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 3.5) now out of fuel (was previously fueled with coal)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5, 3.5) still operational but boiler fuel depleted\n- Pipe network remains operational but boiler inactive\n- Power pole network now properly connected to mining setup\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel management issues (updated)\n- Monitor boiler fuel levels to prevent power interruptions (new failure)\n- Ensure furnaces have fuel before expecting operation (3 total failures)\n- Verify inserter fuel status when using burner inserters\n\n### Production chain verification (updated)\n- Check all components are properly connected (now with power issues resolved)\n- Verify fuel supply chains for all burner devices\n- Test production flow after making changes to setups\n\n### Placement collision errors (continued)\n- Still verify target position is clear before placing entities (24 total occurrences)\n- Clear old entities completely before placing new ones (3 total failures)\n\n### Inserter operation (updated)\n- Ensure proper spacing when placing inserters (9 total failed attempts)\n- Verify inserter fuel status before operations (burner inserters)\n- Check inserter directionality when connecting production chains\n\n### Belt connection rules (continued)\n- Cannot connect belts directly to inserters (2 total occurrences)\n- Verify source and destination entity types before belt connections\n\n### Power system monitoring (updated)\n- Now need to monitor fuel levels for continuous power (new issue)\n- Verify power network coverage when adding new devices\n- Check power pole spacing requirements"}
