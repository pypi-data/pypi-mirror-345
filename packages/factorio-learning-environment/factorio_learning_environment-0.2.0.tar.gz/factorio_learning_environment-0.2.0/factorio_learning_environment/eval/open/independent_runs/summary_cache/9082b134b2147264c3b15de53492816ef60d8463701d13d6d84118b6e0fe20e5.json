{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -21.5, 28.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is currently not connected and has no input liquid, while the boiler is out of fuel and also not connected.\n\n### Pipe groups\n- **PipeGroup at position(-14.5, 15.5)**: Status is EMPTY, consists of pipes at the following positions:\n  - (x=-14.5, y=15.5)\n  - (x=-12.5, y=14.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=14.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=20.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=23.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=24.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=25.5)\n  \n- **PipeGroup at position(-9.5, 19.5)**: Status is FULL_OUTPUT, consists of pipes at the following positions:\n  - (x=-9.5, y=19.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=20.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=22.5)\n\n- **PipeGroup at position(-13.5, 20.5)**: Status is EMPTY, consists of pipes at the following positions:\n  - (x=-13.5, y=20.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=23.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=24.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=25.5)\n\n- **PipeGroup at position(-11.5, 23.5)**: Status is EMPTY, consists of pipes at the following position:\n  - (x=-11.5, y=23.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors related to pipe connections\n- Check the status of pipes and ensure they are properly connected before relying on them for fluid transport. If a pipe group is marked as EMPTY or NOT_CONNECTED, investigate the surrounding connections and ensure there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors with boiler and steam engine\n- Ensure that the boiler has fuel and is connected to a water source via pipes to function properly. If the boiler is out of fuel or has no input liquid, it will not produce steam for the steam engine."}
