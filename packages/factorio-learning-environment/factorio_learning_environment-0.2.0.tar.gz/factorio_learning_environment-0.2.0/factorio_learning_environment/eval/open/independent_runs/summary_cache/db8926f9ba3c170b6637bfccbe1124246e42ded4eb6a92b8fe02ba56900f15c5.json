In this case, a 'Chest' object does not have an 'outputs' attribute. Verify the entity types and their attributes before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
