{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill at position(5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to connection issues\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is connected to a water source and that there are no obstructions (like pipes) preventing the connection to the boiler and steam engine.\n- Check for placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes. Clear any obstructing entities before reconnecting.\n- Verify that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to the power network to avoid 'not connected' errors.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
