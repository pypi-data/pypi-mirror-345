{"content": "\"\"\"\nAh, I see the problem. We can't place the inserter directly at the drill's drop position because there's already entities there (the furnace and another inserter). Let's try a different approach:\n\n1. We need to place the inserter where it can:\n   - Reach the drill's drop position (20.296875, -17.49609375)\n   - Reach the furnace input\n   - Not collide with existing entities\n\"\"\"\n\n# Get our reference points\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\nprint(f\"Drill at {drill.position} with drop at {drill.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Move to drill\nmove_to(drill.position)\nprint(\"Moved to drill\")\n\n# Try placing inserter with more spacing to avoid collision\ninserter = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    reference_position=drill.position,  # Use drill position instead of drop position\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT,  # Place to the right\n    spacing=2  # Increase spacing to avoid collision\n)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to inserter\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\nprint(\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Show final setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities in area: {get_entities(position=drill.position, radius=5)}\")", "summary_range": "[1-2944]"}
