{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n*(Unchanged from previous report, as no new structures were built in these steps.)*  \n\n#### Electricity Generator at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Boiler** at (x=-5.0, y=2.5) (fueled with coal)  \n- **Steam engine** at (x=0.5, y=6.5)  \n- **Small electric pole** at (x=3.5, y=6.5)  \n- **Pipe network** (fluid system 3794 for water, 3796 for steam)  \n  - Pipes connect boiler to steam engine, but steam engine input is blocked at (x=-6.5, y=2.5).  \n\n#### Oil Extraction and Processing Facility at position (x=17.5, y=40.5)  \n- **Pumpjack** at (x=17.5, y=40.5) (powered, extracting crude oil)  \n- **Storage tank** at (x=22.5, y=44.5) (connected via pipes)  \n- **Oil refinery** at (x=29.5, y=48.5) (powered, but crude oil input low at x=30.5, y=51.5)  \n- **Petroleum gas storage tank** at (x=35.5, y=49.5) (receiving gas from refinery)  \n- **Chemical plant** at (x=41.5, y=52.5) (unpowered, missing coal input from chest at x=39.5, y=52.5)  \n- **Wooden chest** at (x=37.5, y=52.5) (empty)  \n- **Wooden chest** at (x=38.5, y=52.5) (contains 94 coal, but no inserter to transfer to plant)  \n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Entity Placement Errors  \n- **Repeated inserter placement on occupied tiles**  \n  - Clear obstructing entities (e.g., pipes/poles) before placing inserters at (x=40.5, y=52.5).  \n- **Invalid `get_entity` calls for non-existent entities**  \n  - Verify entity existence with `find_entities` before fetching (e.g., storage tank at x=35.5, y=49.5).  \n- **Attempting to place chests on occupied tiles**  \n  - Remove existing chest at (x=38.5, y=52.5) before placing a new one.  \n\n#### Fluid System Issues  \n- **Steam engine input blocked at (x=-6.5, y=2.5)**  \n  - Reconnect boiler output (x=-6.5, y=2.5) to steam engine input (x=-2.0, y=6.5) with unobstructed pipes.  \n- **Chemical plant fluid connection error**  \n  - Ensure source entity has fluid before connecting to chemical plant (e.g., petroleum gas input).  \n\n#### Power Grid Gaps  \n- **Chemical plant unpowered despite nearby chest**  \n  - Place small electric pole near (x=41.5, y=52.5) and inserter between chest and plant.  \n\n#### Resource Shortages  \n- **Boiler coal insertion failed due to empty inventory**  \n  - Harvest coal before attempting to fuel boilers.  \n\n#### API Usage  \n- **Invalid `get_entity` calls for non-existent poles/chests**  \n  - Verify entity existence with `find_entities` before fetching.  \n- **Transport belts cannot be connected directly to chests**  \n  - Use an inserter to transfer items from chests to belts.  \n\n#### New Errors in Steps 64-71  \n- **Undefined variable `chest_inserter`**  \n  - Declare variables before referencing them (e.g., `chest_inserter`).  \n- **Incorrect attribute access for `input_connection_points` on `SteamEngine`**  \n  - Use `fluidbox` or `connections` instead of `input_connection_points`.  \n- **Repeated failed inserter placement at (40.5, 52.5)**  \n  - Remove blocking entities (e.g., pipes) before retrying.  \n\n---\n\n### NAMESPACE  \n*(No new functions defined by the agent in these steps.)*"}
