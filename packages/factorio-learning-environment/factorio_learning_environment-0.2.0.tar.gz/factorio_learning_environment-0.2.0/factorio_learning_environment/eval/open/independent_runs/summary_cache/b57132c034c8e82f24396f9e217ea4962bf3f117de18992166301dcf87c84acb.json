{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (41.0, -82.0) facing down\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) containing 230 coal\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5) moving items from drill to chest\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position(-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-18.0, -53.0) facing down\n- Input wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Input burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5) facing right\n- Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n- Output burner inserter at (-13.5, -50.5) facing right\n- Output wooden chest at (-12.5, -50.5) containing 804 iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nMultiple belt groups forming transport paths throughout the map. All belt groups are currently empty and not actively transporting items. The network spans:\n- Horizontal belt sections at various y-levels (-54.5 to -1.5)\n- Vertical belt sections connecting different y-levels\n- Multiple parallel belt lines forming pathways\n- Belt groups connecting various production areas\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Always check if a tile is occupied before placing new entities\n- Remove existing entities before trying to place new ones at the same position\n- When placing entities next to each other, verify there is enough space and no blocking entities\n\n### Errors with Item Insertion\n- Verify required items (like coal or materials) are in inventory before attempting insertion\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner devices\n\n### Errors with Belt Systems\n- Plan belt connections carefully to avoid placement conflicts\n- Ensure you have enough transport belts in inventory before attempting to connect distant entities\n- Remove problematic or unused belt sections before attempting new belt layouts\n\n### Entity Connection Errors\n- Verify space availability and clear path when connecting entities\n- Consider spacing parameters when placing entities next to each other\n- Check for blocking entities in the connection path\n\n### General Tips\n- Keep track of inventory contents before performing operations\n- Monitor fuel levels in all burner devices to maintain operation\n- Clean up unused or blocking entities before new construction\n- Verify entity positions and orientations when modifying existing structures"}
