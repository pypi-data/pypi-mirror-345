{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\n\n#### Furnace at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (52.0, -79.0)\n\n#### Chest Setup at position (53.5, -78.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (53.5, -78.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (54.5, -78.5)\n\n#### Chest Setup at position (56.5, -78.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (56.5, -78.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts to a wooden chest\n- Cannot connect belts directly to a wooden chest. Use an inserter to input items into the chest.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to connect belts with invalid paths\n- Ensure the path between the start and end points for belt connections is valid and unobstructed. Use appropriate entities like inserters for transferring items to chests.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `get_connection_amount(belt_start, belt_end, belt_type)`: Used to calculate the number of belts required to connect two points. Fails when attempting to connect directly to a wooden chest or when the path is invalid.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `required_belts`: Type `int`, used to store the number of belts needed for a connection.\n- `belt_start`: Type `Position`, starting point for belt connection.\n- `belt_end`: Type `Position`, ending point for belt connection.\n- `belt_type`: Type `Prototype`, specifies the type of belt to use (e.g., `TransportBelt`, `UndergroundBelt`)."}
