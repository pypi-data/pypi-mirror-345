Check the target location is clear.\n- Avoid placing pipe-to-ground where the entity footprint overlaps with water. Choose a different, suitable location.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that the underground pipes are correctly aligned and within range to connect. Verify the connection path is valid.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place pipes. Check inventory levels for required components.\n\n### Electricity Network Connection\n- Ensure all electricity-related entities are properly connected to the electric network. Verify connections and plug into the network as needed."}
