{"content": "I notice that both mining drills are out of fuel. Let's fix that first:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Add fuel to both mining drills\n# First mining drill at (-15.0, 23.0)\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0), quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to first mining drill\")\n\n# Second mining drill at (-11.0, 25.0)\nmove_to(Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0))\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0), quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to second mining drill\")\n\n# Verify mining drills are working\ndrill1 = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\ndrill2 = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0))\n\nif drill1:\n    print(f\"First mining drill status: {drill1.status}\")\nif drill2:\n    print(f\"Second mining drill status: {drill2.status}\")\n\n# Check our updated inventory\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should get both mining drills operational again. After this, we can verify if we need to address any other issues with the production line.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Both mining drills were out of fuel\n2. We have coal in our inventory to fuel them\n3. The iron chest is collecting iron ore successfully (51 pieces)\n4. Some inserters are waiting for source items, which should resolve once the mining drills are working", "summary_range": "[1-656]"}
