{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), connected to a series of transport belts.\n- Transport Belts forming a BeltGroup from position (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5), facilitating the movement of mined iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) with no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for input materials.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-10.5, y=-48.5), positioned to insert items into the stone furnace, currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5) for storage purposes.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=-7.5, y=-49.5) and (x=-5.5, y=-49.5), both out of fuel, intended for moving items between entities.\n\n### Additional Belt Systems\n- Multiple BeltGroups and individual belts connecting various positions, indicating an attempt to set up a comprehensive transport network for resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal when none is available in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Belts to Entities\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to entities like Stone Furnaces or Wooden Chests. Use inserters to facilitate the transfer of items between belts and these entities.\n\n### Undefined Variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. The error with `drill_to_belt_inserter` suggests that this variable was not defined. Double-check your code for any undefined variables and correct them by defining them appropriately.\n\n### Inserter Fuel Management\n- Keep track of the fuel levels in your inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which causes them to stop functioning. Regularly refuel inserters to maintain operational efficiency."}
