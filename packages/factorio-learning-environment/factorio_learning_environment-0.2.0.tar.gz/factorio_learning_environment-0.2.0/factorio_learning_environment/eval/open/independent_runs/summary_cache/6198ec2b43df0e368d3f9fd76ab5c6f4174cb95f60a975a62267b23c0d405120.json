{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with various pipes positioned at (19.5, -2.5), (18.5, -2.5), (18.5, -3.5), (20.5, -5.5), etc.\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (24.5, -7.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) with copper plate production\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) with copper plate production\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) with iron plate production\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -12.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at Position (4.5, -9.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, containing water\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -2.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, containing water\n\n### Electrical Network\n- ElectricityGroup with id 2226, consisting of poles at various positions including (21.5, -14.5), (23.5, -12.5), (18.5, -15.5), etc.\n\n### Lab Facility\n- Lab at unspecified position, currently not powered, with input of automation science packs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before placing an entity. For example, the lab could not be placed at Position (12.5, -5.5) due to an obstruction.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For instance, there was an attempt to insert coal into a boiler without having coal in the inventory."}
