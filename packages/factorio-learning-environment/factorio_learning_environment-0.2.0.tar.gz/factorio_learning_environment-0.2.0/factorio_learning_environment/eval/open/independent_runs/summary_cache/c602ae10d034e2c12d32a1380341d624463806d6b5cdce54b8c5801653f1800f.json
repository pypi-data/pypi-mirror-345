{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) and (-14.5, -45.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Transport Belts connecting furnaces and chests\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump and boiler\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to work. Check if the inserter is properly fueled and positioned.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Avoid attempting to harvest resources when the inventory is full. Manage inventory space by storing excess items in chests.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel inserters to ensure they continue operating efficiently.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Verify that the target entity has the specified quantity of items available for extraction before attempting to extract.\n\n### Furnace Output Blocked\n- Ensure that there is sufficient space in the output inventory of furnaces to prevent blockage and halt production.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or sufficient space for inserter outputs to prevent blockage."}
