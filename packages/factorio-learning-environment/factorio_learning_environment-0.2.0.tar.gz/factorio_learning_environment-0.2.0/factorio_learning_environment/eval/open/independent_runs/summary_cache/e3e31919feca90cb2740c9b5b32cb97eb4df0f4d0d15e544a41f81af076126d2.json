{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 (extracting water)\n- Boiler at x=-5.0 y=2.5 (converting water to steam)\n- Steam engine at x=0.5 y=6.5 (generating electricity)\n- Output pipe at x=-6.5 y=2.5 (connecting boiler to steam engine)\n- Power pole at x=3.5 y=6.5 (distributing electricity)\n- Burner inserter at x=-2.5 y=2.5 (feeding coal to boiler)\n\n### Coal Mining System\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at x=16.0 y=0.0 (mining coal)\n- Burner inserter at x=16.5 y=1.5 (moving coal from drill)\n- Wooden chest at x=16.5 y=2.5 (storing coal)\n- Burner inserter at x=16.5 y=3.5 (moving coal from chest to belt)\n- Transport belt system connecting coal storage to boiler inserter\n\n### Iron Mining System\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=15.5 y=70.5 (mining iron ore)\n- Inserter at x=15.5 y=72.5 (moving iron ore to furnace)\n- Stone furnace at x=16.0 y=74.0 (smelting iron ore)\n- Small electric pole at x=17.5 y=68.5 (providing power to mining drill)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity placement in occupied positions\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing entities\n- Use the entity dimensions to calculate proper placement positions\n- For the power pole placement error, ensure the target location is clear of other entities\n\n### Errors with connecting entities directly\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to machines like boilers or furnaces\n- Always use inserters as intermediaries between belts and machines\n- When connecting entities, ensure the drop position is not already occupied by another entity\n\n### Errors with pipe connections\n- Ensure there is a clear path for pipe connections between fluid-handling entities\n- Check that pipe connection points are not blocked by other entities\n- When placing pipes, verify the target location is free of obstacles\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- When placing inserters next to entities with pipes, be mindful of pipe connection points\n- Adjust spacing or direction parameters when using place_entity_next_to() to avoid conflicts\n- Consider the orientation of the target entity when placing inserters\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Ensure all electrical entities are connected to the power network\n- Place electric poles within connection range of electrical machines\n- The inserter in the iron mining system needs power to function"}
