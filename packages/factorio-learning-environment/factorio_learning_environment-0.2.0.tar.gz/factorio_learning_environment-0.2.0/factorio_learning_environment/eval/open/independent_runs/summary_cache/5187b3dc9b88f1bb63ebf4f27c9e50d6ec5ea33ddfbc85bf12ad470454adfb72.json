For example, connecting a small electric pole requires the item to be present in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when Crafting without Required Ingredients\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available before crafting. For instance, crafting a small electric pole requires wood, which is a raw resource that must be gathered first. Ensure you have enough wood in your inventory before attempting to craft small electric poles."}
