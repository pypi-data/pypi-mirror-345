Recent operations have seen coal being inserted and smelting events producing additional iron plates \u2013 the furnace is now recorded with fuel Inventory({'coal': 6}) and a furnace result Inventory({'iron-plate': 34}), but it currently reports NO_INGREDIENTS.\n- Stone furnace at position(3.0, 1.0) that smelts copper ore into copper plates (fuel: 2 coal, produced 6 copper plates, awaiting further ingredients).\n\n### Research Lab at position(6.5, 6.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position(6.5, 6.5) performing \u201cautomation\u201d research with input {automation-science-pack: 10} and status NO_POWER.\n- ElectricityGroup connecting small electric poles at positions (9.5, 6.5), (10.5, 7.5), and (8.5, 6.5) with voltage 0.\n\n### Steam-Powered Electricity Generator at position(2.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position(2.5, 21.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED and warnings [\u201cnot connected to power network\u201d, \u201cno input liquid\u201d, \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d].\n- Boiler at position(-6.0, 24.5) now updated with status NO_FUEL and warnings [\u201cout of fuel\u201d]; its fluid box contains water (\u2248187.10 units at 15\u00b0C).\n- Offshore Pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) operating with status WORKING.\n- Pipeline Network comprising:\n   \u2022 Original segments from earlier constructions at positions (\u20133.5, 22.5), (\u20131.5, 22.5), (1.5, 23.5), (0.5, 24.5), (\u20130.5, 20.5), and (\u20132.5, 23.5).\n   \u2022 Latest connection attempts:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Dedicated four-segment chain (Step 1304): defined chain points (p1: x=-5.0, y=24.0; p2: x=-3.0, y=23.0; p3: x=-0.5, y=22.0; p4: x=0.0, y=21.5) resulted in pipe segments placed at nearest buildable centers (\u20133.5, 24.5), (\u20132.5, 24.5), (2.0, 25.5), and (1.5, 25.0) although subsequent connections between segments failed.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Simplified two\u2010segment chain (Step 1309): attempts to place a mid\u2010segment near (\u20133.75, 23.0) and a target segment near (0.0, 21.5) were aborted due to distance constraints.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Closer reattempt (Step 1310): by moving nearer, a mid-segment pipe was successfully placed at (\u20131.25, 25.5) and a target segment at (\u20130.5, 25.0); while the mid-to-target connection succeeded, the source-to-mid connection failed.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Repositioned four-segment chain (Step 1311): with chain points p1=(\u20136.0, 24.5), p2=(\u20133.0, 23.5), p3=(\u20130.5, 22.5), and p4=(0.0, 21.5), pipe segments were successfully placed at (\u20132.5, 26.0) for both p1 and p2, (4.0, 27.0) for p3, and (\u20132.5, 22.0) for p4; however, none of the attempted segment connections were successful.\n- Manual Fuel Feeding System: Wooden chest at position(\u20134.5, 25.5) designated for fuel storage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n- Pipeline Connection and Construction:\n  \u2022 Always verify that both source and target connection points are clear and buildable before joining pipeline segments.\n  \u2022 When computed chain points fall in unbuildable spots, use nearest_buildable functions and ensure the positions provided are within the maximum placement range (approximately 10 units); if distance errors occur, reposition closer to the target.\n  \u2022 For multi\u2010segment pipelines, recheck that all intermediate segments are placed with clear line-of-sight and without obstructions to facilitate smooth connections between pipe groups.\n  \u2022 Repeated failures to connect segments indicate the need to reposition entities or clear potential blockages before reattempting the connection.\n\n- Resource and Crafting Management:\n  \u2022 Prior to crafting items (e.g. pipes), verify that all required sub\u2010ingredients (such as iron plates) are available; consider initiating preparatory smelting or resource extraction to meet crafting demands.\n  \u2022 Monitor inventory levels vigilantly, especially when a crafting operation requires multiple steps, to avoid shortages during sequential placement tasks.\n\n- Connection Specific Adjustments:\n  \u2022 In cases where connection attempts between source and intermediary segments fail repeatedly, focus on adjusting individual segment placements to align their positions accurately.\n  \u2022 Use the successful connection steps (e.g. in the mid-to-target link from Step 1310) as a reference for fine-tuning placements in future pipeline builds."}
