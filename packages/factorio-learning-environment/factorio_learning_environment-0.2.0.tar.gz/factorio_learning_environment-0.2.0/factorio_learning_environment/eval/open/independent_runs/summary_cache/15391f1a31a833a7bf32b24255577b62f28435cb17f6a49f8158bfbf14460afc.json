{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests have been unsuccessful. The inventory remains unchanged, indicating that no structures have been successfully built.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Burner Mining Drill Placement Errors**: Ensure that the position for placing the Burner Mining Drill is valid and not obstructed. Check that the target position is suitable for the drill and that there is enough space.\n- **Stone Furnace Placement Errors**: Verify that the Stone Furnace is being placed in a valid position, ideally directly below a drill if intended for mining operations. Ensure the area is clear and suitable for placement.\n- **Wooden Chest Placement Errors**: Confirm that the position for placing the Wooden Chest is valid and unoccupied. Ensure there is ample space and the area is suitable for placement.\n\n### Errors related to BuildingBox\n- **BuildingBox Size Issues**: When defining the BuildingBox for the Burner Mining Drill, ensure that the dimensions are correctly specified and compatible with the map's available space. Consider using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if space is constrained.\n\n### Errors in API Usage\n- **Type Errors in Code**: When using functions like `int()`, ensure that the arguments provided are of the correct type, such as strings or numbers, and not incompatible types like 'ModelPrivateAttr'.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- **Finding Buildable Spots**: If a buildable spot cannot be found, consider adjusting the BuildingBox size or exploring different areas on the map for placement. Ensure that the chosen location is viable for the intended structure.\n\nBy addressing these errors and ensuring correct placement and API usage, the agent can successfully build structures and progress in the game."}
