{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for harvesting iron ore.\n\n### Iron plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=4.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal supply\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Coal stored in the furnaces at positions (x=2.0, y=0.0), (x=4.0, y=0.0), and (x=6.0, y=0.0) for fueling the furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces. The error \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" indicates that the agent attempted to insert iron ore without having any in its inventory.\n\n### Errors related to furnace status\n- Monitor the status of the furnaces. Warnings such as \"furnace source is full\" or \"furnace result is full\" indicate that the furnaces cannot accept more items. Ensure that there is space in the furnace source and result inventories before inserting items.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
