{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -86.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (43.0, -86.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -84.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (43.5, -84.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (42.5, -84.5)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, -56.5)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-17.0, -52.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (-16.5, -50.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -51.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -51.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-11.5, -48.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting into a full chest\n- Ensure the chest has enough space before attempting to insert items. Check the inventory capacity and remove items if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when mining with a full chest\n- Empty the chest at the drop position to allow the mining drill to continue operating.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without fuel\n- Ensure the furnace has sufficient fuel before attempting to smelt items. Add coal or other fuel sources as needed.\n\n#### Errors when accessing attributes on a string\n- Verify the object type before accessing attributes. Ensure the object is of the expected type and has the required attributes.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `extract_items(position: Position, item: str, amount: int) -> bool`: Extracts items from a chest or mining drill at the specified position. Success: Items are extracted and added to inventory. Failure: Position is invalid or entity does not contain the specified items.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `inventory: dict`: Current inventory of the agent, containing items and their quantities.\n- `entities: list`: List of entities on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
