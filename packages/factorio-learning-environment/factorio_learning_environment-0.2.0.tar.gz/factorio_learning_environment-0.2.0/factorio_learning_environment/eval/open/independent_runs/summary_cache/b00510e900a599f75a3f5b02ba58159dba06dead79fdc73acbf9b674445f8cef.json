{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nA large mining setup consisting of:\n- Three burner mining drills in a row at positions:\n  - (-10, -59)\n  - (-8, -59)\n  - (-6, -59)\n- Three stone furnaces positioned to receive ore directly:\n  - (-9, -57) receiving from first drill\n  - (-7, -57) receiving from middle drill\n  - (-5, -57) receiving from last drill\nAll components are operational and working, with proper fuel supplies.\n\n### Coal Distribution System at (0, -2.5)\nA row of storage chests containing coal:\n- Four wooden chests at positions:\n  - (0.5, -2.5)\n  - (2.5, -2.5)\n  - (4.5, -2.5)\n  - (6.5, -2.5)\nEach chest contains 40 coal units.\n\n### Smelting Line Complex at (0, 0)\nA production line consisting of:\n- Four stone furnaces at positions:\n  - (0, 0)\n  - (2, 0)\n  - (4, 0)\n  - (6, 0)\n- Four burner inserters for input at:\n  - (0.5, -1.5)\n  - (2.5, -1.5)\n  - (4.5, -1.5)\n  - (6.5, -1.5)\nConnected to coal storage chests above\n- Additional burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) for output handling\n- Output storage chests at:\n  - (0.5, 2.5) containing 42 iron plates\n  - (2.5, 1.5)\n  - (4.5, 1.5)\n  - (6.5, 1.5)\n- Side loader inserter at (7.5, 0.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing new entities\n- When replacing entities, remove the existing entity first before placing a new one at the same position\n\n### Mining System Optimization\n- Ensure furnaces are placed at exact drop positions relative to their associated mining drills\n- Verify entity status after placement to confirm proper operation\n- Pay attention to warning messages about blocked outputs and missing sink entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices\n- Keep track of inventory space and resource distribution"}
