{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: Full output with 100 iron plates\n  - Fueled with coal\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: Full output with 100 iron plates\n  - Fueled with coal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Waiting for space in destination\n  - Connected to Furnace 2\n- **Additional Storage Chests**\n  - Chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) with 50 iron plates\n  - Chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) with 415 iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Extracting iron ore\n- **Wooden Chests** for ore storage\n  - Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) with 1 iron ore\n  - Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) with 183 iron ore\n- **Burner Inserters** for ore transfer\n  - Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not full to allow continuous operation. Consider adding additional storage or managing output to prevent blockage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source for the inserter is adequately supplied with items to prevent idle time. Regularly check and refill the source as needed.\n\n### Fuel Management for Mining Drills and Furnaces\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and furnaces to maintain continuous operation and avoid downtime.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor and manage inventory levels to ensure that production facilities are not halted due to full output inventories. Consider expanding storage or processing capacity as needed."}
