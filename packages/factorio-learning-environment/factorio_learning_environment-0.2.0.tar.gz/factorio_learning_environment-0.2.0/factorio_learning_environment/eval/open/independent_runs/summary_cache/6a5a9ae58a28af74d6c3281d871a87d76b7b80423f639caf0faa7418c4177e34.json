{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) ready to transfer items from the chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) extracting resources, with its output directed towards a wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) receiving output from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring items from the wooden chest.\n- **BeltGroup** with inputs and outputs, facilitating the transport of coal and other materials across positions, including belts at positions (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5), (x=49.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5), (x=43.5, y=-84.5) to (x=45.5, y=-84.5), and (x=45.5, y=-85.5) to (x=47.5, y=-85.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when mining drill output is blocked\n- Ensure that the area around the mining drill's output is clear of items on the ground to prevent blockage. Regularly check and clear any obstructions to maintain efficient output flow.\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Verify that inserters have a clear path and are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities."}
