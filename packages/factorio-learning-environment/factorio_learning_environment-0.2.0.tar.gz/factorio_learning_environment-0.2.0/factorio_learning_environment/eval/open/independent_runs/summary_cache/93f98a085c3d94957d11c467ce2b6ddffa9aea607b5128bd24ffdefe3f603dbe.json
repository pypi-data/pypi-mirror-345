{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a status indicating no ingredients to smelt. The furnace has produced 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Network at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- PipeGroup with a fluid system ID of 9799, covering positions:\n  - (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=23.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions:\n  - (x=-4.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-3.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-1.5, y=22.5)\n  - ... (additional positions omitted for brevity)\n  - (x=0.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=0.5, y=20.5)\n  - (x=-1.5, y=16.5)\n- Voltage: 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure that the position selected for placing an offshore pump is suitable for its placement. Repeated errors indicate that the selected positions were not suitable for the offshore pump.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Placement\n- Verify that the position for placing a boiler is suitable and unoccupied. Multiple attempts to place boilers at unsuitable positions were made.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Connection failures indicate misalignment or incorrect positioning.\n\n### Errors with Electric Pole Connections\n- Check that electric poles are placed correctly to ensure connectivity. Placement issues have prevented successful connections.\n\n### Boiler Placement API Misuse\n- Ensure that the correct data types are used when invoking boiler placement functions. Errors indicate incorrect argument types were provided."}
