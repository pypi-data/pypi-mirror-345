Always add an inserter to feed items into the steam engine and use that as the connection endpoint.\n\u2022 Placing Entities Out of Range\n\u2003\u2013 Move closer to the designated target position before attempting to place an entity; this avoids distance\u2010related placement failures.\n\u2022 Inconsistent or Undefined Target Variables\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that target entity variables (e.g. for chests) are defined and referenced consistently to prevent naming errors.\n\u2022 Insufficient Inventory for Placement\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the necessary item (such as a wooden chest) is available in inventory before attempting placement."}
