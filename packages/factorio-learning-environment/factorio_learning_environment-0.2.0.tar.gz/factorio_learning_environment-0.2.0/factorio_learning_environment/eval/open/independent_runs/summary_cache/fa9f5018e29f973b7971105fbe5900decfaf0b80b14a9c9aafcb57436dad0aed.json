{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple recovery updates attempted to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but all placement and crafting efforts failed due to missing inventory and resource shortages. \n\u2022 Although smelting operations were performed using furnaces retrieved at Position(5.0, 5.0) (for iron plate smelting) and Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) (for copper plate smelting), these furnaces are pre\u2010existing game entities and were not constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Accuracy\n\u2003\u2013 When invoking get_entities, ensure the function is called with the correct parameters. Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments. Validate against the function\u2019s expected signature to prevent TypeErrors.\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Checks\n\u2003\u2013 Before attempting to place an entity (e.g., a Lab), confirm that the required item is present in the inventory. Implement checks to handle cases where the inventory returns None, which can prevent iteration errors.\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Validation\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available in sufficient quantities before initiating a craft. Address shortages by gathering or processing raw resources beforehand.\n\u2022 Robust Exception Handling\n\u2003\u2013 Incorporate error handling around API calls and crafting processes to catch exceptions immediately. This includes providing fallback strategies (such as converting a None return to an empty list) to avoid cascading failures during recovery updates."}
