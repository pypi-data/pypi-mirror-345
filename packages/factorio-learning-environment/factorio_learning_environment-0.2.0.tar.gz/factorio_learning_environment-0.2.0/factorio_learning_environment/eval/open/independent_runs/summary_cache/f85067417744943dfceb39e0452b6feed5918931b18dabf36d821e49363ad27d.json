{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', indicating it is not connected to a fluid source.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel', indicating it is not operational due to lack of fuel.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) which is operational and working, supplying water to the system.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting various entities to manage fluid flow, with segments at positions such as (x=3.5, y=17.5) and (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n- **Electricity Group** with poles distributed at positions such as (x=3.5, y=20.5) and (x=14.5, y=20.5), indicating the setup for electricity distribution, though currently with zero voltage.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Connectivity\n- Ensure all fluid connections are properly established. The steam engine is not receiving any fluid due to missing connections. Verify all pipes are correctly placed and connected to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- The boiler is out of fuel, preventing it from operating. Regularly check fuel levels and refill as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Distribution\n- The electricity poles are set up, but there is zero voltage. Ensure that the power generation system is operational and connected to the electricity network to supply power.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the logs provided.\n- **Important Variables**: None explicitly assigned in the logs provided."}
