{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0) - Status: NO_FUEL\n- Offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Small electric poles (multiple positions)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) - Status: WORKING\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. For example, a boiler cannot be placed at (-4.5, 23.0) because another entity already exists there.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors related to boiler and steam engine connections\n- Ensure that the boiler is fueled and connected properly to the steam engine to avoid issues with power generation."}
