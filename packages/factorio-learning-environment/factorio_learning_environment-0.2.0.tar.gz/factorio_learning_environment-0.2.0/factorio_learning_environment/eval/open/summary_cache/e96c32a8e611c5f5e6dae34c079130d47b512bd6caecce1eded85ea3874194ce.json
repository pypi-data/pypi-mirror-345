{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore but with frequent full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage and input/output buffers for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), fueled and operational, moving items between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric poles at (15.5, 75.5) and (17.5, 72.5) connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace output persists, limiting throughput.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, though output congestion remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5), fueled with coal and operational.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5), connected to boiler by pipes and generating power.\n- Small electric poles placed near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly added poles at (0.5, 6.5) and (17.5, 72.5), forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates to assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational, intended to move assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine reports shortage of iron plates preventing iron gear wheel production despite iron plates being inserted into input chest.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and inserter setup, but lacks effective input material flow into the assembler.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Multiple failures to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) and mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) due to tile occupancy or water tiles.\n- Failed attempts to place burner inserter next to furnace at (18.0, 75.0) blocked by mining drill at (17.5, 72.5).\n- To avoid these errors, verify tile occupancy and terrain before placement. Increase spacing, change placement direction, or select alternate reference positions to find valid placement tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters sometimes wait for source items due to lack of input materials in connected chests or machines.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel and source inventories to prevent stoppages and waiting states.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) connected to power but unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates in its input inventory.\n- Despite iron plates being inserted into input chest at (21.5, 75.5), assembler input inventory remains empty.\n- Output chest at (25.5, 82.5) remains empty; attempts to extract iron gear wheels fail due to none being produced.\n- Ensure inserters or belts properly transfer iron plates from input chest to assembling machine input. Verify inserter pickup/drop positions and connections.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, limiting smelting throughput.\n- Power network improved with additional poles at (0.5, "}
