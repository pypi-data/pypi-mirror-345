Duckduckgo search using fzf. This is a wrapper around the duckduckgo command-line util [ddgr](https://github.com/jarun/ddgr) which uses the fuzzy search tool, [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), to select a result and then writes the url of the result to standard output.


# Attribution
This tool is effectively a thin wrapper around [ddgr](https://github.com/jarun/ddgr) and [python fzf](https://github.com/nk412/pyfzf)

# Installation
```
pipx install ddgz
```

# Usage
```
ddgz hello world
```

You likely want to use the result, my motivation was to place it on the clipboard while editing documents, for which I use this.

```
ddgz | xclip -selection clipboard -i
```

I personally define a snippet (which I call `ddcli`) for the above using my zsh snippet manager [zshnip](https://github.com/facetframer/zshnip).


# Alternatives and prior work
ddgr can output results to JSON, this can be used for arbitrary purposes.

I tried to find tools to search google. I found [googler](https://github.com/jarun/googler) but this was deprecated and I could not install this with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
