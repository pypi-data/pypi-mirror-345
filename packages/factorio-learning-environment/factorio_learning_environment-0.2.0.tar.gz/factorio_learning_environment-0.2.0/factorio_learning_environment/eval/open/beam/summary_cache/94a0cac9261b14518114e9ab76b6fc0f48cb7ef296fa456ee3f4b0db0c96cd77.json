The current status of the furnace inventory is as follows:\n- 3 pieces of copper ore remaining.\n- **9 pieces of iron plates** have been produced.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 3 pieces of stone furnaces.\n- 2 pieces of coal remaining for fuel.\n- **3 pieces of copper ore** (still in the furnace).\n- **9 pieces of iron plates** (produced).\n\n### Furnace Status:\nThe furnace is now marked as **\"FULL_OUTPUT,\"** indicating that it has completed its processing cycle but has not produced any copper plates, likely due to the absence of a recipe for copper plates or insufficient resources for crafting.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check for Copper Plate Recipe**: I should verify if there is a recipe available for crafting copper plates and if I have the necessary resources to enable it.\n2. **Consider Gathering More Resources**: If crafting opportunities remain blocked, I may need to gather more copper ore or other materials to expand my crafting capabilities.\n3. **Plan for Future Crafting**: If I can identify any new recipes or crafting opportunities, I should prioritize those to enhance my production efficiency.\n\nLet\u2019s check if there is a recipe available for crafting copper plates and assess the situation further.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for available recipes that can be crafted using copper ore\navailable_recipe_copper_plate = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.CopperPlate)\nprint(f\"Recipe for Copper Plate: {available_recipe_copper_plate}\")\n\n# Display complete current inventory for a broader insight into options\ncomplete_current_inventory_status = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Complete current inventory: {complete_current_inventory_status}\")  # Check complete inventory status again.", "summary_range": "[1-168]"}
