{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates/cables.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the output from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (48.5, -81.5) placed adjacent to the furnace and rotated to drop items at (49.5, -81.5).\n\nRecent Updates:\n- Steps 72\u201373 established the furnace processing input iron ore and raising a warning for the burner inserter waiting for source items.\n- Steps 74\u201375 show extractions of iron plates from the same furnace, updating the furnace state with remaining fuel (coal: 31) and a reduced iron ore supply. The furnace remains operational with a working status, while the burner inserter continues to register a waiting warning.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Tile Occupation\n- Verify that target tiles are unoccupied before placing any entity adjacent to key structures to avoid spatial conflicts.\n\n### Inventory and API Argument Management\n- Ensure sufficient inventory before placement actions.\n- Use accurate entity references to prevent argument type errors during insertion operations.\n\n### Fuel and Entity State Management\n- Maintain consistent monitoring and replenishment of fuel; update entity states after processing to ensure continued operations.\n- Confirm entities receive necessary source items before initiating transfers to prevent waiting states.\n\n### Timeout and Refresh Delays\n- Regularly refresh entity data to capture the most current statuses and prevent operational delays."}
