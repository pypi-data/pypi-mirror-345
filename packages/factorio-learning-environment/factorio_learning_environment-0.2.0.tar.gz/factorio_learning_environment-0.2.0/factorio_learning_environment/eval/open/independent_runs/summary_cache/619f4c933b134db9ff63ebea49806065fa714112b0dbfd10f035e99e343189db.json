{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump (position -9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING, providing water to the system.\n- Small Electric Pole (position -8.5, 23.5) - Provides power to nearby entities.\n- Pipe connections to Boiler (position -11.5, 25.0) and other pipes.\n\n### Boiler at position (-11.5, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -11.5, 25.0) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT, converting water into steam.\n- Pipe connections to Offshore Pump (position -9.5, 24.5) and Steam Engine (position -11.5, 18.5).\n\n### Steam Engine at position (-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine (position -11.5, 18.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED, requires steam from Boiler.\n- Pipe connections to Boiler (position -11.5, 25.0).\n\n### Lab at position (unknown)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position unknown) - Status: NO_POWER, requires power to operate.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles providing power to various structures.\n\n### Pipe Groups\nConsists of various pipes connecting the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities due to placement issues\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect (e.g., Offshore Pump to Boiler, Boiler to Steam Engine) are placed correctly and within the required range for connection.\n\n### Errors related to Lab not receiving power\n- Make sure that the Lab is connected to a power source. Check the connections and ensure that there are no breaks in the power network.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities that might block placement."}
