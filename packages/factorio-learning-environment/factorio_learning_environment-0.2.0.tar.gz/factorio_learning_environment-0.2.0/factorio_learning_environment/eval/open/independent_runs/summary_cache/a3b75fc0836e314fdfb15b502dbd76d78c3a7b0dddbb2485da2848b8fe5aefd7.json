Repeated errors occurred due to attempting to connect belts directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine object. Always ensure that an inserter (which inputs items into the machine) is used as the connection target.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Distance  \n  \u2013 An error placing a wooden chest at (3.5, 15.5) was reported because the player\u2019s position (0, 0) was too far (15.89 units, exceeding the maximum allowed distance of 10). Move closer to the target position before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage  \n  \u2013 A placement error occurred when no wooden chest was found in the inventory. Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before placing an entity.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Error  \n  \u2013 A NameError (\u201cname 'target_chest' is not defined\u201d) indicates a mismatch or omission in variable naming. Ensure that variable names used in target assignments are defined consistently."}
