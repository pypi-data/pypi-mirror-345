{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Water Source\n- A new water source has been identified at position x=-9.0, y=25.0. However, no structures have successfully been placed to utilize this water source yet.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Offshore Pump Placement\n- Multiple attempts to place an offshore pump were unsuccessful due to unsuitable positions. Ensure that the position selected for placing the offshore pump is adjacent to a water source and is free from obstructions. Consider checking the terrain and proximity to water before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors in Boiler Placement\n- Attempts to place a boiler at positions such as x=-12.5, y=25.0 and x=-16.0, y=24.0 were unsuccessful due to unsuitable positions. Verify that the intended placement area is clear of other entities and is suitable for the boiler's requirements. Ensure that the boiler is placed on solid ground and connected to both a water source and a steam engine if applicable.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve the efficiency of its setup and avoid unnecessary resource expenditure."}
