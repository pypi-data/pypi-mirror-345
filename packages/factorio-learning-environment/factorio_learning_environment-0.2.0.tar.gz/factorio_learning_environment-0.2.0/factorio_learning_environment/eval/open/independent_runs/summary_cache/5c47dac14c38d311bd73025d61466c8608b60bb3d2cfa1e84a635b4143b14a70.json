{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-8.0, -59.0)\nConsists of:\n- 3 Burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), and (-6.0, -59.0)\n- 3 Wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\nAll drills are operational with coal fuel and mining iron ore resources\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (3.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- 4 Stone furnaces in a row at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- 4 Input burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5)\n- 4 Output burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- 4 Input wooden chests with coal at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- 4 Output wooden chests collecting iron plates at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5)\nAll furnaces are operational with coal fuel and processing iron ore into plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with item insertion\n- When inserting items into entities, ensure the item count is a positive integer value\n- Verify the target entity has enough space before attempting to insert items\n\n### Inserter placement issues\n- The input inserters are showing \"output blocked\" warnings because there are items on the ground blocking their drop positions\n- Ensure there is proper clearance for inserters to drop items at their target locations\n\n### Entity output handling\n- Some inserters are in \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" state\n- Make sure destination containers have enough capacity to receive items\n- Consider adding more storage capacity or improving item flow when entities get blocked"}
