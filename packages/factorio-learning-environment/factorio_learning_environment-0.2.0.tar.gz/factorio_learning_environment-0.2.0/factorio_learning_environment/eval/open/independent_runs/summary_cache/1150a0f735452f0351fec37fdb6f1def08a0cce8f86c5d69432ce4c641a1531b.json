{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-10.5, y=-48.5) connected to the stone furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=-7.5, y=-49.5) and (x=-5.5, y=-49.5) connected to the wooden chest\n\n### Belt Systems\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT, consisting of 4 belts\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5), direction RIGHT, consisting of 6 belts\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-17.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-52.5), direction UP, consisting of 7 belts\n- Individual belts connecting various positions such as (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5), direction UP\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Connection of Belts to Objects\n- Ensure belts are not directly connected to objects like Wooden Chests or Stone Furnaces. Use inserters to facilitate the transfer between belts and these objects.\n\n### Errors in Inspecting Belt Inventory\n- When attempting to inspect the inventory of a belt, ensure that the belt is correctly initialized and that the inventory is accessible. Avoid attempting to index a nil value.\n\n### Refueling and Resource Management\n- Regularly check fuel levels and resource availability in mining drills, furnaces, and inserters to prevent production halts due to lack of fuel or resources."}
