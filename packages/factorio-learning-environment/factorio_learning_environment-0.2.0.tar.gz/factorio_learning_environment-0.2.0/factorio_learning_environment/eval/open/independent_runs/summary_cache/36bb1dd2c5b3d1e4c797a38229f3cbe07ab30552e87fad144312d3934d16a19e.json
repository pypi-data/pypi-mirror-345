{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler and steam engine, positions include (-8.5, 22.5), (-9.5, 22.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), and (-7.5, 22.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to small electric poles at positions (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Lab Facility\n- Lab at position with status NO_POWER, connected to the electricity network but not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free from other objects before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent placement failures due to existing objects in the way.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before crafting or placing entities, verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory. For instance, ensure you have enough copper cables before attempting to craft small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connections\n- Ensure that all components of the power network are properly connected. This includes making sure that steam engines are connected to the power network and that labs and inserters are receiving power.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Recipes\n- Verify that all ingredients required for crafting are available in the necessary quantities to avoid assertion errors during crafting processes."}
