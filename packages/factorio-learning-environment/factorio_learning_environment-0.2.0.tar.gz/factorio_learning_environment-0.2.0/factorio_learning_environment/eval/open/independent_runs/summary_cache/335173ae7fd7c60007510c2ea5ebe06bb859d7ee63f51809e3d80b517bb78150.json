{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and another at position (-18.0, -70.0) for smelting iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) and another at position (-21.0, -62.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) for transferring items from furnace to chest.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of Transport Belts and Wooden Chests for copper ore transport and storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for storing copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) for transferring iron ore from chest to processing.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chests at various positions for storing different resources like coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n\n### Belt Systems\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups for transporting resources across the map:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5) and from (-21.5, -67.5) to (-21.5, -69.5).\n- Additional BeltGroups at various positions for resource transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connection\n- Ensure continuous placement of transport belts without gaps. Check alignment and connectivity between belts at positions like (-20.5, -67.5) and (-21.5, -66.5) to avoid gaps.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel Burner Mining Drills and Inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Ingredient Supply to Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of ingredients to avoid warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\" Check the supply lines and inserters feeding into the furnaces.\n\n### Inserter Source Item Availability\n- Ensure that source items are available for inserters to pick up, preventing them from waiting for source items and stalling operations."}
