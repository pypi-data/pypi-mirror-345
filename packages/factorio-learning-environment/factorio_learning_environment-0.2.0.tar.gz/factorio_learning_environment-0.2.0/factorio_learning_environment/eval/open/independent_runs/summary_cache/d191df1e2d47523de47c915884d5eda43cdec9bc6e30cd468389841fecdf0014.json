{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nThis structure is designed for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is fueled by coal and is responsible for extracting iron ore. It is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): These chests are used to store the extracted iron ore. The chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) contains iron ore, while the other is empty.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): This furnace processes iron ore into iron plates. It currently has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): This inserter is responsible for moving items between entities. It is currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Extracting Iron Ore\n- Ensure that the target wooden chest contains iron ore before attempting to extract. Check the chest's inventory to confirm the presence of iron ore.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Consider expanding storage capacity if necessary.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Maintain sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills and other coal-dependent entities. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed to avoid interruptions in operations."}
