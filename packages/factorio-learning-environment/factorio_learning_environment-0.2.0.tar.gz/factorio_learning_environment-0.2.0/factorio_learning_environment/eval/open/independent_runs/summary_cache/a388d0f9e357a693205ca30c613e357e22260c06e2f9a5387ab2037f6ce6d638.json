The error indicates that the furnace at position (0, 0) is full, which prevents the insertion of coal.\n- Check the inventory of the furnace before inserting items to avoid overfilling. The current inventory status shows that the furnace is full (50/50 items) at position (0, 0).\n- When inserting coal into furnaces, ensure that the furnace is not already at capacity to prevent failed insertions."}
