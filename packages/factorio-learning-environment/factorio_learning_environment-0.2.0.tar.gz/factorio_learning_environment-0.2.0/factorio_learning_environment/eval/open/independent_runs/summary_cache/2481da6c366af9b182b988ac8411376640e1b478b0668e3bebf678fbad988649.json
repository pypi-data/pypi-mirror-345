Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. Gather necessary raw materials if they are not available.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing raw resources\n- Some items require raw resources that cannot be crafted and must be gathered. Ensure you have gathered all necessary raw materials before attempting to craft complex items."}
