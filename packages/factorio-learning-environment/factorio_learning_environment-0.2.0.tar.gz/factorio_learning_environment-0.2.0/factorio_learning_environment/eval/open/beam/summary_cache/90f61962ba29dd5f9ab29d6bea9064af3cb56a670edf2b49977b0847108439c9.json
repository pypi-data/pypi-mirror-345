{"content": "I can now analyze the interaction patterns with the Factorio AI based on our attempts:\n\nKey Findings:\n1. Inventory Management:\n- Always check inventory contents before attempting operations\n- The inventory shows up as a dictionary with item types as keys\n- Items we've seen: stone-furnace, coal, stone, iron-ore, iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel\n\n2. Crafting:\n- Successfully crafted iron gear wheels using iron plates (2 plates \u2192 1 gear)\n- The recipe system works but shows as \"enabled=False\" in the output\n- Crafting automatically deducts required resources from inventory\n\n3. Furnace Operations:\n- Can extract items from furnaces successfully\n- Furnaces have separate storage for: fuel, source materials, and results\n- Can check furnace status including warnings and current state\n- Need to move_to() furnace position before interactions\n\n4. Common Errors:\n- Most frequent error: trying to insert items we don't have in inventory\n- Need to use .get() method with dictionaries to avoid KeyErrors\n- Always verify resource availability before attempting insertions\n\nSuccessful Patterns:\n```python\n# Pattern 1: Safe inventory checking\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nif inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 2:\n    # Safe to craft\n\n# Pattern 2: Safe extraction\nif furnace.furnace_result.get('iron-plate', 0) > 0:\n    move_to(furnace.position)\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, quantity=25)\n\n# Pattern 3: Safe crafting calculation\nnum_plates = inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\nnum_possible = num_plates // 2\nnum_to_craft = min(num_possible, desired_amount)\n```\n\nRecommendations for Future:\n1. Always check inventory before operations\n2. Use defensive programming with .get() method\n3. Move to locations before attempting interactions\n4. Extract resources before attempting to insert new ones\n5. Keep track of inventory changes after operations\n6. Verify recipes and requirements before crafting\n\nThese patterns should help create more robust interactions with the Factorio AI in future attempts.", "summary_range": "[1-202]"}
