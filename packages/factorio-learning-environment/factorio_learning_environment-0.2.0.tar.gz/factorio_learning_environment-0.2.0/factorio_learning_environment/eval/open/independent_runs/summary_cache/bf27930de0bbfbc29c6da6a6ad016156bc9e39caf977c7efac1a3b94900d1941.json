{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Pipe connections between these components, including PipeGroups at various positions such as (-50.5, -122.5), (-44.5, -123.5), and others.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper-plate output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with iron-plate output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no current output.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Small Electric Pole at Position (5.5, -60.5) and a Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0).\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5).\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with automation-science-pack input, currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe and Electricity Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups and an ElectricityGroup, interconnecting various parts of the map.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before attempting to place a pipe. Clear any existing objects that might block the placement.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Steam Engine to Electric Pole\n- Verify that the connection path between the steam engine and the electric pole is clear and that both entities are correctly aligned for connection.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Check that the steam engine is properly connected to a power network and has a sufficient input of steam. Ensure all components in the power generation chain are operational and correctly configured.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that the inserter is connected to a powered electric pole and that the power network is active. Check for any disconnections or power shortages in the network."}
