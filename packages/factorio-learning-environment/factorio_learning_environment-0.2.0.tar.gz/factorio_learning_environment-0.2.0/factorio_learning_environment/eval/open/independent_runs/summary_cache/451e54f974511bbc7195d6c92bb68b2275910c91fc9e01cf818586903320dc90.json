{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Group at position (x=0.5, y=1.5) and (x=5.5, y=4.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric pole at position (x=0.5, y=1.5)\n- Electric pole at position (x=5.5, y=4.5)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Lab at position (x=6.5, y=6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x=6.5, y=6.5) with current status: no power.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with fuel: coal (18), status: no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with fuel: coal (7), status: no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new entities\n- Ensure that the first argument for placing an entity is a valid Prototype object. Review the prototype definitions before attempting to place entities like electric poles or wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when the lab is not powered\n- Check the power connections to the lab. Ensure that electric poles are properly placed and connected to a power source to avoid the lab being unpowered.\n\n### Errors when inserting into entities\n- When attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the second argument is a valid Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Verify the target entity before performing the insert operation.\n\n### Errors due to existing entities blocking placement\n- Ensure that the area where you want to place an electric pole or any other entity is clear of existing entities. If there are entities in the way, consider relocating them or choosing a different position."}
