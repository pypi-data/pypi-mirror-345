{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts to place furnaces and other entities have failed due to various errors, as detailed in the error tips section below.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place a chest. Multiple attempts to place chests at various coordinates (e.g., x=14.0 y=3.0, x=16.0 y=3.0, etc.) failed because the tile was already occupied.\n\n### Errors when placing transport belts\n- Verify that the starting position for transport belts is clear and unoccupied. Placement attempts at positions like x=0.5 y=0.0 and x=2.5 y=0.0 were unsuccessful.\n\n### Errors when placing furnaces\n- Confirm that the intended position for furnace placement is buildable and free of obstructions. Numerous attempts to place furnaces at positions such as x=0.0 y=0.0, x=10.0 y=10.0, and x=21.0 y=21.0 failed due to the area not being buildable or already occupied.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace is correctly placed and operational before attempting to insert items like coal. Errors occurred when trying to insert coal into non-existent or improperly placed furnaces.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Before placing any entity, identify a clear and buildable area. The agent identified several potential buildable areas but failed to place entities due to obstructions or incorrect assumptions about the buildability of the area.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in setting up structures and managing resources effectively."}
