{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore. It is currently fueled with coal and is operational. It drops mined resources into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores extracted iron ore and iron plates. It is currently full, which may impede further mining operations.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is currently out of fuel, which prevents it from operating.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): This furnace processes iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled and operational, currently containing a small amount of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Ensure Sufficient Fuel Supply\n- The inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) frequently runs out of fuel, which halts the transfer of iron ore to the furnace. Ensure that there is a consistent supply of coal or other fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Manage Inventory Space\n- The wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) is full, which can stop the mining drill from depositing more resources. Regularly check and clear the chest to prevent overflow and interruptions in mining operations.\n\n### Monitor Resource Processing\n- The furnace has repeatedly produced 0 iron plates after processing, indicating potential issues with resource input or fuel supply. Ensure that the furnace is consistently supplied with both iron ore and fuel to maintain production efficiency."}
