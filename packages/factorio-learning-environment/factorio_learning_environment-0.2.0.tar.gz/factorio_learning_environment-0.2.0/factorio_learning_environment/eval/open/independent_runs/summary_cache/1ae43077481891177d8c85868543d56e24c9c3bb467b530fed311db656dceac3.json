{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5) - currently working\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=4.0) - working with coal, but requires regular refueling\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=7.5) - working and generating power\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole (x=1.5, y=7.5)\n\nThe system is operational but requires regular coal refueling to maintain power. The boiler has been running out of fuel periodically, causing power outages across the factory. Coal was added in steps 104, 107, and 110 to restore power.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (x=18.5, y=73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=18.5, y=73.5) mining iron ore - currently not working due to full chest\n- Wooden chest (x=18.5, y=75.5) collecting iron ore from the drill (currently contains 791 iron ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=19.0, y=77.0) with coal, currently working with 15 iron ore\n- Inserter (x=19.5, y=78.5) to move iron plates from furnace to chest - working\n- Wooden chest (x=19.5, y=79.5) for iron plate storage (currently contains 4 iron plates)\n- Chest output inserter (x=19.5, y=80.5) to extract plates from chest - waiting for space in destination\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=19.5, y=81.5) with belts extending to (x=14.5, y=78.5) - currently contains 32 iron plates\n- Additional belt system from (x=8.5, y=75.5) to (x=9.5, y=77.5) connecting to the circuit assembly\n- Small electric poles (x=21.5, y=73.5), (x=20.5, y=75.5), (x=21.5, y=78.5), (x=21.5, y=80.5)\n\nThe system is partially working with the furnace smelting iron ore into plates, but the mining drill is not working due to the full chest, and the output belt is partially blocked.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (x=-48.5, y=78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=-48.5, y=78.5) mining copper ore - currently not working due to full chest\n- Wooden chest (x=-48.5, y=80.5) collecting copper ore from the drill (currently contains 791 copper ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=-48.0, y=82.0) with 4 coal, currently working with 15 copper ore\n- Inserter (x=-47.5, y=83.5) to move copper plates from furnace to chest - working\n- Wooden chest (x=-47.5, y=84.5) for copper plate storage (currently contains 3 copper plates)\n- Chest output inserter (x=-47.5, y=85.5) to extract plates from chest - waiting for space in destination\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=-47.5, y=86.5) extending to (x=-22.5, y=86.5) - currently contains 103 copper plates\n- Small electric poles (x=-45.5, y=78.5), (x=-46.5, y=80.5), (x=-45.5, y=83.5), (x=-45.5, y=85.5)\n\nThe system is partially working with the furnace smelting copper ore into plates, but the mining drill is not working due to the full chest, and the output belt is blocked.\n\n### Circuit Production System\nConsists of:\n\n#### Copper Cable Assembly (x=-6.5, y=74.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (x=-6.5, y=74.5) set to produce copper cables - currently has ingredient shortage\n- Input inserter (x=-8.5, y=74.5) to feed copper plates - waiting for source items\n- Output inserter ("}
