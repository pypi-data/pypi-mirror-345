{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (x=1-3, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of two parallel smelting setups:\n- Furnace at (1,1) with burner inserter at (1.5,2.5) outputting to wooden chest at (1.5,3.5)\n- Furnace at (3,1) with burner inserter at (3.5,2.5) outputting to wooden chest at (3.5,3.5)\nAdditional chest at (5.5,3.5) with burner inserter at (5.5,2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (x=2-4, y=7-9.5)\nTwo parallel smelting setups:\n- Furnace at (2,7) with burner inserter at (2.5,8.5) outputting to wooden chest at (2.5,9.5)\n- Furnace at (4,7) with burner inserter at (4.5,8.5) outputting to wooden chest at (4.5,9.5)\nConnected by transport belts from (2.5,8.5) to (4.5,8.5)\n\n### Assembly Line System (x=8.5-21.5, y=10.5-15.5)\nComplex production setup with:\n- Copper cable assembling machine at (14.5,14.5)\n- Electronic circuit assembling machine at (21.5,15.5)\n- Multiple wooden chests and burner inserters for item movement\n- Connected by multiple belt groups for material transport\n\n### Power Generation System (x=2.5-13.5, y=35.5)\nComplete electricity generation setup:\n- Offshore pump at (2.5,35.5) providing water\n- Boiler at (7.0,35.5)\n- Steam engine at (13.5,35.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups carrying water (system 3483) and steam (system 3486)\n- Electricity network (id=13736) connecting various electrical entities\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Assembly Machine Resource Shortages\n- Ensure proper supply chains are set up for assembly machines\n- Copper cable machine needs copper plates\n- Electronic circuit machine needs iron plates and copper cables\n\n### Fluid System Connectivity Issues\n- One offshore pump at (-5.5,26.5) shows \"No fluid present in connections\"\n- Ensure proper pipe connections between fluid producers and consumers\n\n### Inserter Efficiency Issues\n- Multiple inserters show \"waiting for source items\"\n- Some inserters report \"chest is full\" warnings\n- Design buffer storage and throughput to prevent bottlenecks\n\n### Belt System Optimization\n- Multiple belt groups are empty\n- Ensure proper material flow through transport belt networks\n- Review belt layouts to optimize material movement between production areas"}
