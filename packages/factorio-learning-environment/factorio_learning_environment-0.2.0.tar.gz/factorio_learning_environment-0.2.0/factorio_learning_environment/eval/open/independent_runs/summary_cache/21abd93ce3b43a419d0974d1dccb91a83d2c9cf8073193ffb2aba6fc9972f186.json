{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a furnace located at (5.0, 5.0) used to process iron ore into iron plates. This furnace was employed during the recovery steps to boost the iron-plate count through smelting operations.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace located at (-27.0, -60.0) used to process copper ore into copper plates. It was used in the copper plate production step to resolve the resource shortage for subsequent crafting requirements.\n\nNo Lab has been successfully placed or crafted on the map despite multiple attempts.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Parameter Inconsistencies with get_entities  \n  \u2013 Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments such as 'radius' and ensure the parameters match the function\u2019s expected signature to prevent TypeErrors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures  \n  \u2013 Verify that the inventory contains a Lab before attempting to place one. Ensure placement commands target locations that are unoccupied and eligible for the Lab entity.\n\n\u2022 Iteration on a NoneType Result  \n  \u2013 Confirm that calls retrieving collections (such as labs = get_entities(...)) return a valid list. Fallback to an empty list when a None value is encountered prior to iterating.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Resources for Lab Crafting  \n  \u2013 Ensure that all prerequisite items (iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, etc.) are available and that their production chains (smelting and crafting) are operating properly before reattempting Lab creation."}
