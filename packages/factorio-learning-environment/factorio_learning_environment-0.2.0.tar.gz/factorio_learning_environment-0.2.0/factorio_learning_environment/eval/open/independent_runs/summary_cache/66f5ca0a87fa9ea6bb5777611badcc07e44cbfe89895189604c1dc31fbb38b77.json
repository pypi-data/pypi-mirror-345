For example, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full chest\n- Check the inventory of the target chest before inserting items to ensure there is enough space. If the chest is full, clear some space before attempting to insert more items.\n\n### Errors when inserting incorrect item types\n- Verify the type of item you are inserting matches the expected input for the target entity. For instance, ensure you are inserting iron ore into a furnace expecting iron ore, not coal."}
