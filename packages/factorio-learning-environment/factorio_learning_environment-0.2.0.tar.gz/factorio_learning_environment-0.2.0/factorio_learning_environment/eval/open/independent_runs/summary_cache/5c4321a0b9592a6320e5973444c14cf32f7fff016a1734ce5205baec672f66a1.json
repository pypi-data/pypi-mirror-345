{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (14.5, 22.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (14.5, 22.5)\n- Boiler at position (not specified in logs)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with notable pipe positions at (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and (14.5, 22.5)\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the power network, with notable pole positions at (3.5, 20.5) and (14.5, 20.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0), each with coal as fuel and producing iron plates\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storage\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (not specified in logs) with automation science packs but currently without power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move closer to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting placement. Remove any existing entities blocking the desired position.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Placement\n- Verify that the target location for placing a steam engine is not obstructed by other entities or unplaceable terrain such as water.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for any misplaced pipes or obstructions.\n\n### Errors with Entity Retrieval\n- Confirm the presence and correct positioning of entities before attempting to retrieve them using the API. Double-check coordinates for accuracy.\n\n### Errors with Power Network Connection\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to connect entities to the power network. Verify the connectivity between electric poles and the steam engine.\n\n### Errors with BuildingBox Initialization\n- Ensure that all parameters used in initializing structures like BuildingBox are correctly defined and of the expected data type.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Functionality\n- Investigate why the steam engine is not functioning even after successful placement and connection. Check for any missing components or incorrect configurations in the setup."}
