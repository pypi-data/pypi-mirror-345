{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) providing iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for ore storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-13.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) waiting for source items to transfer to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities have sufficient resources to supply to the inserters. Regularly check and refill the source chests to avoid production delays.\n\n### Source is Empty\n- Monitor the resource levels in source entities like chests and mining drills. Refill them promptly to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly extract items from the furnace output to prevent production halts due to full output inventory.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entities (e.g., chests or belts) have enough space to accommodate items being transferred by inserters. Regularly clear or expand storage to avoid blockages."}
