The complete inventory status is as follows:\n\n### Complete Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of stone remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Furnace Status:\n- The furnace is currently displaying a status of **\"NO_INGREDIENTS\"** and has a warning indicating **\"no ingredients to smelt.\"** This confirms that without Copper Ore, it cannot proceed with any smelting operations.\n- The furnace is still holding **1 piece of stone** and **18 Iron Plates**, but it is not processing due to the lack of required ingredients.\n\n### Observations:\n- The absence of Copper Ore indicates that it was either not properly tracked after previous operations or was lost during the interactions.\n- The furnace is not operational for Copper processing, which is critical for further production.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Locate Copper Ore**: I need to find a nearby Copper Ore deposit to gather more resources.\n2. **Harvest Copper Ore**: Once located, I will harvest the Copper Ore to enable smelting in the furnace.\n3. **Reinsert Copper Ore**: After gathering, I will reinsert the Copper Ore into the active furnace to initiate the smelting process.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to locate and harvest Copper Ore. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Find the nearest Copper Ore resource patch\ncopper_resource_position = nearest(Resource.CopperOre)\n\n# Move to the identified Copper Ore resource position\nmove_to(copper_resource_position)  # Navigate to the nearest Copper Ore location \n\n# Harvest the Copper Ore resource\nharvest_resource(nearest(Resource.CopperOre), quantity=10)  # Attempting to gather Copper Ore \n\n# Check the overall inventory again after harvesting to confirm collected Copper Ore\noverall_inventory_after_copper_harvest = inspect_inventory()  # Check overall inventory after harvest.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after harvesting Copper Ore: {overall_inventory_after_copper_harvest}\")  # Confirm total inventory after harvesting Copper Ore. \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.
