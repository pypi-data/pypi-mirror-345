{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Coal Mine at position(15.5, -0.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Stone Mine at position(-46.5, -0.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Copper Ore Mine at position(-46.5, 70.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Copper Plate Smelting Factory at position(16.0, 69.0)\nConsists of three stone furnaces at positions (16.0, 69.0), (18.0, 69.0), and (20.0, 69.0)\n\n### Automation Science Pack Factory\nConsists of two assembling machines at positions (0.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator at position(-4.5, 0.0)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5), a boiler at position(-4.5, 0.0), and a steam engine at position(-4.5, 3.5)\n\n### Power Pole at position(-2.5, 3.5)\nConsists of a small electric pole at position(-2.5, 3.5)\n\n### Additional Furnaces\nConsists of two stone furnaces at positions (5.0, 0.0) and (7.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variable Errors\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. For example, 'entity' was not defined in previous steps.\n\n### Harvesting Errors\n- Make sure to move to the target entity before harvesting.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available before crafting. \n- Ensure that the required sub-ingredients can be crafted.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Check if the target position is occupied before placing an entity.\n- Verify that the entity to be placed is available in the inventory.\n\n### Insertion Errors\n- Verify that the item to be inserted is available in the inventory.\n- Verify that the correct item is being inserted.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item to be extracted.\n\n### Entity Retrieval Errors\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before trying to retrieve it.\n- Ensure that the entity exists on the map before trying to retrieve it.\n- Ensure that the entity is correctly indexed when retrieving from a list.\n\n### Pipe Connection Errors\n- Ensure that the source and target entities for pipe connection are correctly identified and are not blocked.\n- Verify that the target entity is able to receive the fluid from the source entity.\n\n### New Errors\n- In Step 120, the agent failed to craft iron-gear-wheel due to missing iron-plate.\n- In Steps 122, 124, and 127, the agent tried to insert copper ore into a furnace without having copper ore in the inventory.\n- In Step 125, the agent used an undefined variable 'entity'.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item_type, entity, quantity)`: Inserts a specified quantity of an item into an entity. \n    - Failure modes: No item to insert from the inventory.\n- `craft_item(item_type, quantity)`: Crafts a specified quantity of an item.\n    - Failure modes: Unable to craft due to missing required sub-ingredients or ingredients.\n- `connect_entities(source_entity, target_entity, connection_type)`: Connects two entities with a specified connection type (e.g., pipe).\n    - Failure modes: No valid connections between source and target entities.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler`: The boiler entity in the Electricity Generator structure.\n- `steam_engine`: The steam engine entity in the Electricity Generator structure.\n- `assembling_machine`: The assembling machine entity in the Automation Science Pack Factory structure.\n- `furnace1`, `furnace2`: Furnace entities in the Additional Furnaces structure."}
