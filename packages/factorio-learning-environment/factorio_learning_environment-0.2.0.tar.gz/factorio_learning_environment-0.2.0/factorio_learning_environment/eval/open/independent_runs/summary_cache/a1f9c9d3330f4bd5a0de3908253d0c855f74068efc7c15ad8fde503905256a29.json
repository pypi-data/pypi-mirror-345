{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5) connected to the furnace\n- Burner Inserter at position (-7.5, -49.5) connected to a wooden chest\n- Burner Inserter at position (-5.5, -49.5) with no connected entities\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to a transport system:\n  - Belt from position (-15.5, -54.5) to (-13.5, -54.5)\n  - Belt from position (-12.5, -54.5) to (-10.5, -54.5)\n  - Additional belts forming a transport network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Stone Furnaces\n- Ensure you use an inserter to connect belts to a stone furnace. Direct connections from belts to furnaces are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Ensure you have sufficient resources in your inventory before attempting operations such as inserting items into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before attempting to refuel inserters or furnaces."}
