{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0), fueled with coal and operational, with frequent full output inventory warnings.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage and input/output buffers for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), fueled and operational, moving items between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to the power network.\n- Continuous insertion of coal into furnace and active extraction/insertion of iron plates between chests and furnace observed.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt drop position remains unresolved, causing mining drill to wait for space.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with stable power and inserter fueling, but output congestion persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5), fueled with coal and operational.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5), connected via pipes to boiler, generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and at (15.5, 75.5) connected to the power network.\n- Regular coal insertion into boiler confirmed.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supporting factory operations.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power network via small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates directly to assembler input.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty with no iron gear wheels produced.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational, intended to move assembled items into output chest.\n- Repeated insertion of iron plates into assembler input chest and assembler itself.\n- Assembling machine reports shortage of iron plates preventing crafting, despite iron plates being inserted.\n- No iron gear wheels present in assembler output or output chest, indicating no production.\n- Burner inserters fueled and operational.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and inserter fueling stable, but no actual crafting occurs due to missing or unrecognized input materials.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt drop position\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked due to full furnace output inventory and belt congestion.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and chests downstream to accept smelted iron plates.\n- Ensure continuous removal of iron plates from furnace output to prevent stoppage.\n\n### Missing or unrecognized input materials in assembling machine\n- Despite iron plates being inserted into the input chest at (21.5, 75.5) and directly into the assembler at (25.5, 80.5), the assembling machine input inventory remains empty.\n- As a result, no iron gear wheels are produced and output chest at (25.5, 82.5) remains empty.\n- Verify correct insertion method and that iron plates are properly transferred into the assembler\u2019s input inventory.\n- Confirm assembler recipe is correctly set and that input chests are properly connected to the assembler.\n- Avoid attempting to extract iron gear wheels from output chest when none exist to prevent exceptions.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles (unchanged)\n- Continue verifying tile occupancy before placing entities like small electric poles.\n- Adjust placement parameters or spacing to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management (unchanged)\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and operational.\n- Maintain monitoring of inserter fuel and inventory to prevent stoppages.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo new user-defined functions have been introduced in the recent steps."}
