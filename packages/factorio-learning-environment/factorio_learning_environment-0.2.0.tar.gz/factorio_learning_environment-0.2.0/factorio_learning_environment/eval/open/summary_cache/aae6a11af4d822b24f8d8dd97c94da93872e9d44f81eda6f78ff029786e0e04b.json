{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates from the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) oriented right, transferring iron plates from furnace to chest\n\nThis structure forms a compact iron plate production line where raw iron ore is mined, smelted, and output stored.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserter next to occupied tile\n- When placing the burner inserter next to the furnace at (16.0, 73.0), the position (17.5, 73.0) was already occupied by the wooden chest, causing placement failure.\n- To avoid this, check for entity occupancy before placement, increase spacing, or adjust direction or reference position to find a free tile.\n\n### Fuel management errors\n- The burner mining drill and burner inserter frequently ran out of fuel, causing stoppages.\n- Ensure continuous insertion of coal into all fuel-consuming entities to maintain operation.\n\n### Extraction errors due to missing variable definition\n- The variable `extracted_ore` was referenced before assignment, causing a NameError.\n- Always initialize and assign variables before use in conditional checks.\n\n### Extraction failures from drill drop position\n- Attempts to extract iron ore from the drill\u2019s drop position failed due to no valid entity containing iron ore at that location.\n- Confirm correct extraction positions and that the drill has output items before extraction attempts.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
