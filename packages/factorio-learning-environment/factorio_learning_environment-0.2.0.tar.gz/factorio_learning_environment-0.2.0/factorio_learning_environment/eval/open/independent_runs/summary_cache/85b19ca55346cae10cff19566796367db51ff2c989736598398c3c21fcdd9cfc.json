{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=38, y=-83)\n- Mining drill at (38.0, -83.0) with coal fuel supply\n- Output chest containing coal\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -83.5) moving items from position (39.5, -83.5) to (41.5, -83.5)\n- Transport belt system consisting of multiple connected belts from (41.5, -83.5) to (46.5, -83.5)\n\n### Multiple Belt Transport Groups\n1. Main Belt Group\n- Input positions: (20.5, -84.5), (41.5, -83.5)\n- Output position: (51.5, -83.5)\n- Actively transporting coal and iron ore\n\n2. Secondary Belt Group\n- Input position: (48.5, -80.5)\n- Output position: (43.5, -80.5)\n- Actively transporting iron ore and coal\n\n3. Additional Belt Networks (Currently Empty)\n- Network connecting (-10.5, -50.5) to (19.5, -80.5)\n- Network connecting (-11.5, -50.5) to (17.5, -80.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Placement Errors\n- Always check and clear existing entities before placing new belts\n- Verify target position is empty before attempting to place transport belts\n- When rebuilding belt systems, ensure complete clearance of old belts before placing new ones\n\n### Belt Congestion Issues\n- Monitor belt saturation and clear congested belts when necessary\n- Implement regular belt clearing routines when rebuilding or reorganizing transport systems\n- Ensure proper spacing between belt segments to prevent backup\n\n### Inserter Placement and Operation\n- Clear the destination belt tile before placing or reconfiguring inserters\n- Verify inserter drop position is clear and properly aligned with transport belts\n- Monitor inserter warnings about blocked destination positions\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\nNone explicitly defined in the logs\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Mining drill status: EntityStatus\n- Belt group status: EntityStatus\n- Inserter status: EntityStatus\n- Inventory contents: Dict[str, int]\n- Entity positions: Position(x: float, y: float)"}
