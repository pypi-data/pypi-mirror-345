Continue monitoring both furnaces as they process their remaining iron ore.\n2. Once they finish, we should gather more iron ore to keep production going.\n3. Assess our inventory of iron plates to determine if we can craft additional entities or expand our factory operations.\n\nLet's wait a little longer to see how many iron plates are produced as both furnaces finish processing their iron ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the furnaces to finish processing\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration if needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-94]"}
