{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently without power and output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and working, but frequently full on source inventory and output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational, moving iron plates between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Persistent output blockage at furnace belt drop position causing mining drill stoppage and power issues.\n\nThis structure handles iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with inserters fueled and operational but still suffering from output blockage and power connectivity issues at the mining drill.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal but currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) not connected to power network and without input fluid, thus not generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5), connected but insufficient to power steam engine.\n\nThis structure is intended for steam power generation but currently non-operational due to boiler fuel shortage and steam engine not connected to power network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) lacking power and iron plate input, thus not crafting.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) holding iron plates but not feeding the assembling machine.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled with coal but waiting for source items.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5) connected to power network but not powering assembling machine.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production but remains inactive due to lack of power and input materials.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Multiple failed attempts to place small electric poles near steam engine (0.5, 6.5), iron ore mining area (around 17.5, 72.5), furnace (18.0, 75.0), and assembling machine (25.5, 80.5) due to existing entities occupying target tiles.\n- To avoid these errors, always check tile occupancy before placement and consider increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or selecting alternative reference positions.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and operational.\n- Some inserters experience output blockage due to no sink entity to accept output items, causing them to wait.\n- Maintain clear output paths and ensure destination chests or belts have sufficient capacity to prevent inserter stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) remains unpowered and without input iron plates, preventing crafting.\n- Input and output inventories of the assembling machine are consistently empty.\n- Ensure assembling machine is connected to power network and iron plates are supplied to its input chest to enable production.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage and no power reception.\n- Furnace at (18.0, 75.0) frequently has full source inventory and output inventory, preventing further smelting.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, causing steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) to have no input fluid and no power generation.\n- Steam engine is not connected to power network, further preventing power supply to mining"}
