{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal and currently working. It has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n  - Neighbors with a wooden chest and a burner inserter.\n  \n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Contains iron ore and is positioned to receive ore from the mining drill.\n  - Inventory currently holds 8 units of iron ore.\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Refueled with coal and aligned to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n  - Status indicates it is waiting for source items, suggesting a possible issue with the supply chain.\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Refueled with coal but not receiving iron ore, resulting in a status of \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n  - Positioned to receive iron ore from the burner inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Double-check the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly set.\n\n### Errors with Chest Inventory Management\n- Regularly monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining operation. Consider using additional storage solutions or more frequent extractions to manage inventory levels.\n\n### Errors with Resource Availability for Smelting\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain from the mining drill to the furnace to identify any blockages or misalignments.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Empty or Low Inventory\n- Before attempting to extract items from a chest, verify that the chest contains a sufficient quantity of the desired item to avoid extraction errors."}
