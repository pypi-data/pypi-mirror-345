{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore and smelt it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is not occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and functionality\n- Double-check the alignment and direction of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning properly.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly refuel entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities have a sufficient supply of coal or other fuel types.\n\n### Errors with full or empty chests\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt the mining process. Similarly, ensure that chests are not empty when they are expected to supply materials to other entities."}
