{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with a current inventory of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore between chests.\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the chests.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions storing different resources such as iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure chests are emptied regularly to avoid stoppages in mining operations. For example, the chest at position (52.5, -84.5) is full, preventing further coal mining.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items to prevent them from idling. For instance, the burner inserter at position (-16.5, -69.5) is waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) is currently lacking ingredients to process.\n\n### General Placement and Inventory Management\n- Regularly check the status of all entities to ensure they are functioning optimally and that inventories are managed efficiently to prevent bottlenecks."}
