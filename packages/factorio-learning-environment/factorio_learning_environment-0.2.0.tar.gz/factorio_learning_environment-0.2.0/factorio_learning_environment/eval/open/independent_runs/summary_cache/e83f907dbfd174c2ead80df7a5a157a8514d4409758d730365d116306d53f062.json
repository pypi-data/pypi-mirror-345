{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The logs indicate that attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces have been unsuccessful, and no entities have been successfully placed on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, Burner Mining Drills, and Stone Furnaces is not occupied by another entity or is a valid buildable area. Check the surroundings and clear any obstructions before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors related to finding buildable spots\n- When attempting to place a Burner Mining Drill, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. If no viable location is found, consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to fit the available area.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from the map\n- Verify the existence of entities like Stone Furnaces at the specified positions before attempting to interact with them. Ensure that the coordinates are correct and that the entity type matches the expected prototype.\n\n### Errors in movement commands\n- When issuing movement commands, ensure that the coordinates are correctly formatted and that the indices used are integers. Avoid using strings or incorrect data types in position specifications.\n\n### Errors in production setups\n- Check the setup for producing iron plates to ensure that all necessary components are correctly placed and operational. Verify that the inputs and outputs are properly connected and that there is a continuous flow of materials.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in building and managing structures on the map."}
