Ensure that the upstream supply is sufficient to keep the inserters operational. Check the supply lines and ensure that resources are being transported efficiently to these inserters.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- The chests at drop positions for the mining drills are full. Ensure to regularly empty the chests at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining operations without interruptions. Consider expanding storage capacity or increasing the frequency of resource collection.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Furnaces at positions (43.0, -82.0), (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) have warnings for no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that the supply of raw materials to these furnaces is consistent and sufficient to maintain production."}
