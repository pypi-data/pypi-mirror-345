{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-6.0, -0.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-2.5, -0.5)\n- Connected by a PipeGroup with pipes at positions [(-7.5, -2.5), (-6.5, -2.5), (-8.5, -0.5), (-7.5, -0.5), (-7.5, -1.5)]\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at Position (15.5, 70.5) and (18.5, 70.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric Mining Drill at position (15.5, 70.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (15.5, 72.5)\n- Electric Mining Drill at position (18.5, 70.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 72.5)\n- Both drills are powered by an Electricity Group with poles at positions [(18.5, 20.5), (20.5, 22.5), (22.5, 24.5), ..., (25.5, 69.5), (13.5, 71.5), (23.5, 71.5)]\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (16.0, 74.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 74.0) fueled by coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (16.5, 75.5) to collect iron plates\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Facility at Position (19.5, 77.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling Machine 2 at position (19.5, 77.5) set to produce iron gear wheels\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 75.5) to feed iron plates into the assembler\n- Wooden Chest at position (21.5, 77.5) to collect iron gear wheels\n- Connected to the power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities at Occupied Positions\n- Ensure the target position for placing an entity is unoccupied. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Production\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available and correctly inserted into production entities like furnaces and assemblers to ensure they are operational.\n\n### Inserter Operational Errors\n- Check that inserters are correctly positioned and have a source item to pick up. Ensure they are powered and not waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the items you are trying to insert into entities. Verify that the source inventory is not empty.\n\n### Errors when Asserting Power Supply\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to a power source and that the power source is operational.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Electric Poles\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with electric poles are within range and correctly indexed.\n\n### Errors when Finding Nearest Entities\n- Make sure that the entities you are trying to find, such as steam engines, are placed on the map before attempting to locate them.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions between the source and target entities when connecting them with pipes. Verify that the target entity can receive fluids from the source.\n\n### NameError for Undefined Functions\n- Before using a function like `shift_entity`, ensure it is defined. Consider using existing functions like `get_entity`, `rotate_entity`, or `pickup_entity` if applicable.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities at a Distance\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when Assembling Machine is Not Producing\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has all required ingredients in its input inventory. Check that the machine is powered and the recipe is correctly set.\n\n### Errors with Assembler Not Producing Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that the assembler has a continuous supply of required ingredients. Regularly check and replenish the input inventory to maintain production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions Defined by the Agent\n- `get_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any`: Retrieves an entity at a given position.\n- `rotate_entity(entity: Any, direction: Any) -> Any`: Rotates an entity in the specified direction.\n- `pickup_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any`: Picks up an entity from a given position.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `power_source_position`: Position of the nearest power source.\n- `pipes_to_steam_engine`: Connection status between boiler and steam engine using pipes.\n- `chest_1`: Instance of a wooden"}
