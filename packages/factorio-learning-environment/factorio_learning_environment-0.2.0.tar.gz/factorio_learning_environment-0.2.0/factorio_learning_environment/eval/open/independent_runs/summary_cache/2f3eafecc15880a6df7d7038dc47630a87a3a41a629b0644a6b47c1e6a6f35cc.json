Check for blockages or misaligned pipes between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a power source. Ensure that small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to provide power.\n\n### Errors with Placement Blockage\n- Before attempting to connect pipes or place entities, ensure the target tiles are unoccupied and free of blockages to avoid connection failures."}
