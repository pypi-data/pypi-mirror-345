{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the boiler and steam engine, with fluid system ID 70748\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Unit at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to move items between the chest and furnace\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science packs but currently not conducting research\n\n### Storage Units\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates and copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Sub-Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, copper-plates are needed for crafting copper-cables which are required for small-electric-poles.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items\n- Verify that there is a nearby entity capable of accepting the item you are trying to insert. For instance, ensure that the furnace is ready to accept copper plates.\n\n### Power Supply Issues\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters, are connected to a power source to function correctly. Check the electricity network connections and resolve any disconnections or lack of power supply.\n\n### Furnace Warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" by ensuring that the furnace has the necessary raw materials to process."}
