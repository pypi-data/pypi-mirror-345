For example, 'PipeGroup' does not have a 'direction' attribute.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Double-check the connections between pipes to ensure they are correctly aligned and within reach.\n\n### Errors when connecting steam engines\n- Ensure that all necessary components are present in the inventory before attempting to connect entities like steam engines to electric poles.\n\n### Errors with steam engine power generation\n- Verify that the steam engine has all necessary inputs and connections to generate power. Check for fluid presence and connectivity to the power network."}
