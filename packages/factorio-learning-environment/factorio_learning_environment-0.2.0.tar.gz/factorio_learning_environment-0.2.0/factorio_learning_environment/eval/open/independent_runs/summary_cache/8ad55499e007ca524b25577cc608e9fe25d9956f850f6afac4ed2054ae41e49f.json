{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with a fuel inventory of coal. The furnace has warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full.\" It currently has a status of \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" with a result inventory containing iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Group\n- Located at position x=-12.5, y=21.5, this group consists of pipes connecting multiple positions: (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5). The status of the pipe group is \"EMPTY.\"\n\n### Electricity Group\n- This group includes electric poles positioned at various coordinates such as (x=-7.5, y=17.5), (x=-6.5, y=16.5), (x=-8.5, y=16.5), and others up to (x=1.5, y=18.5). The group is identified by id 51719 and has a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving to a new area\n- Ensure that the indices used for movement are integers. Avoid using strings as indices.\n\n### Errors when finding suitable positions for offshore pumps\n- Double-check the terrain and ensure that the location is suitable for placing an offshore pump. Consider moving to a different location if the current one is unsuitable.\n\n### Errors when placing boilers and steam engines\n- Verify that the position is suitable for placing boilers and steam engines. Ensure that the terrain and space are appropriate for these entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes and entities\n- Ensure that the connections between pipes and entities like offshore pumps and boilers are valid. Check the alignment and compatibility of the entities being connected.\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Verify that electric poles are placed correctly to ensure connectivity. Check for any placement issues that might prevent the poles from connecting effectively.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to incorrect data types\n- Ensure that the data types used for positions and other attributes are correct. Avoid using non-numeric types where numeric values are expected."}
