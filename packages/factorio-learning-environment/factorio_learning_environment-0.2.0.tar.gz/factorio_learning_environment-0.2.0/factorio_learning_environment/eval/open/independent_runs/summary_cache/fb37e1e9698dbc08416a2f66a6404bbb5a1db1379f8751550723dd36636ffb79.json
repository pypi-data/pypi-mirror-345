{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, with pipes at positions such as (x=20.5, y=-10.5), (x=21.5, y=-10.5), etc.\n- Small Electric Poles at positions like (x=24.5, y=-6.5) and (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) that puts into assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) to assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Wooden Chests at various positions such as (x=-3.5, y=0.5), (x=8.5, y=0.5), and (x=-3.5, y=2.5)\n- Inserters at positions like (x=7.5, y=5.5) and (x=9.5, y=5.5)\n- PipeGroups and ElectricityGroups connecting various entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, trying to insert copper ore into a furnace without having any in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to missing resources in assembling machines\n- Make sure to supply the necessary ingredients to your assembling machines to avoid production halts. For instance, the assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) requires copper plates to produce copper cables.\n\n### Errors due to no fuel in boilers\n- Keep your boilers fueled to ensure continuous electricity generation. The boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) is currently out of fuel, which can disrupt power supply.\n\n### Errors due to no ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) is currently lacking ingredients to process.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source entity for inserters has items available to be moved. Inserters at positions like (x=-3.5, y=1.5) are waiting for source items, indicating a potential supply chain issue."}
