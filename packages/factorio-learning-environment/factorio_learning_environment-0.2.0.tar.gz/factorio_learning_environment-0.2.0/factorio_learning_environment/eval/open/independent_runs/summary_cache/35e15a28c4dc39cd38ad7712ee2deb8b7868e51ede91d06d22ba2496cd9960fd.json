{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) for coal collection\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) for iron ore collection\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) for copper ore collection\n- Burner inserter at (20.5, 22.5) for chest output\n- Belt system running from (21.5, 17.5) to (21.5, 21.5)\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) for copper plate storage\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) for furnace output\n- Belt system running from (22.5, 21.5) to (24.5, 18.5)\n\n### Unused Furnaces\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Cannot place inserters where transport belts already exist. Check the target position is clear before placing new entities\n- When placing entities next to existing structures, ensure proper spacing and direction parameters to avoid conflicts with existing entities\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Inserters are showing \"output blocked\" warnings. Ensure there is a valid destination entity (like a chest or belt) at the drop position\n- Configure inserter drop positions to align with valid input positions of target entities\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" status. Ensure proper input material flow through inserters and belts\n- Verify the complete production chain is properly connected and all components (mining drills, inserters, belts, furnaces) are correctly aligned"}
