Although a burner inserter was placed several times (at positions such as 1.5, 0.5 and others) to work with the furnace\u2019s pickup zone, final logged state shows only the input chest and furnace present on the map.\n\n### Stone Furnace for Copper Smelting at position(5.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 5.0, 0.0) that processes copper ore and coal to produce copper plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Entity Placement and Alignment Conflicts \u2013 When placing components (for example, input chests), verify that the target tile is free from conflicts with adjacent automation (such as an existing burner inserter). Adjust spacing or direction to avoid overlapping entities.\n\u2022 Reconfiguration Overlaps \u2013 Completely remove interfering or residual entities from previous setups before placing new ones to prevent alignment issues.\n\u2022 Reference and Spacing Parameter Validation \u2013 Ensure that reference positions and spacing values are correct. Errors such as attempting to index a nil reference indicate that the referenced entity may not exist at the expected location.\n\u2022 Undefined Function Usage \u2013 Confirm that utility functions (e.g., shift_entity) are defined before use. If a required function is not available, either define it or substitute it with a supported alternative.\n\u2022 Invalid Prototype Handling \u2013 Ensure that functions expecting a valid entity prototype receive the correct type rather than a string (as seen with shift_entity_local), to avoid attribute errors.\n\u2022 Fuel Supply and Inventory Insertion Controls \u2013 As noted previously, confirm that sufficient fuel is available and that correct inventory contents are present before attempting fueling or insertion operations."}
