{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Storage Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n- **Transport Belts** connecting the mining drill to the chest and further distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Furnace** at position (61.0, -54.0) with ingredients: iron-plate\n- **Furnace** at position (64.0, -53.0) with ingredients: iron-ore and iron-plate\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (62.5, -53.5) and (65.5, -52.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (61.5, -52.5) for storing produced items\n\n### Belt Network\n- Multiple **BeltGroups** connecting various parts of the facility, including:\n  - From position (43.5, -81.5) to (49.5, -79.5)\n  - From position (49.5, -79.5) to (59.5, -69.5)\n  - From position (59.5, -69.5) to (65.0, -51.0)\n  - From position (59.5, -69.5) to (66.0, -51.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure that the path for the transport belts is clear and valid before attempting to connect segments. Verify that there are no obstacles or invalid paths in the intended route.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Regularly check inventory levels to prevent blockages due to full inventories. Consider using additional storage solutions or managing production rates to avoid overproduction.\n\n### Extraction and Insertion Errors\n- Ensure that there is space in the target inventory before attempting to extract or insert items. This can be managed by frequently clearing output chests and ensuring that there is demand for the produced items.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-powered entities, such as burner mining drills and inserters, are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the logs provided.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory levels of various items.\n- `furnace_ingredients`: Dict[str, Dict[str, int]] - Tracks the ingredients present in each furnace.\n\nThis report summarizes the current state of the agent's structures and provides tips for improving efficiency and reducing errors in future operations."}
