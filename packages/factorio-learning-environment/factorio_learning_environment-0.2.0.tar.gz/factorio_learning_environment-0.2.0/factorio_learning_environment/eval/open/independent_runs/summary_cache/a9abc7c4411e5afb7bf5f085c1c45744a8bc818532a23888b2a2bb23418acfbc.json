{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (-82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Input chest (iron-chest) at (41.5, -83.5) containing coal\n- Output chest (wooden-chest) at (41.5, -80.5) containing coal\n- Additional storage chest (iron-chest) at (41.5, -84.5) containing coal\n\n### Iron Smelting System around (-81.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input chest (wooden-chest) at (45.5, -79.5) containing iron ore\n- Output chest (wooden-chest) at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n- Three burner inserters:\n  - At (44.5, -79.5) feeding first furnace\n  - At (46.5, -79.5) feeding second furnace \n  - At (48.5, -80.5) moving completed plates to output chest\n- Additional storage chest (wooden-chest) at (45.5, -84.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing inserters or other entities, verify the target position is clear of other entities\n- Multiple attempts to place inserters at occupied positions (45.5, -80.5), (45.0, -80.0), (45.0, -79.5) failed\n- Consider checking entity collision boxes before placement\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drill is out of fuel and has a full output chest - implement chest emptying logic\n- Furnaces have fuel but no ingredients - need to ensure proper material flow\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `first_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `second_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n\n### System States\n- Chest inventories are being monitored\n- Furnace states (fuel, ingredients) are being tracked\n- Inserter pickup/drop positions are verified\n\nThe agent appears to be implementing an automated smelting system but is having issues with entity placement coordination and resource flow management."}
