{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully built during these steps. The agent repeatedly attempted to establish a Laboratory at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to advance research, but all placement and crafting attempts failed.  \n\u2022 Although interactions occurred with furnace units\u2014an iron-smelting furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper-smelting furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\u2014these were existing infrastructure used for smelting operations and were not newly created.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Consistency \u2013 When using get_entities, avoid mixing unsupported keyword arguments and positional parameters. Review the function\u2019s signature so that only permitted arguments (and in the correct order) are supplied.  \n\u2022 NoneType Handling \u2013 Ensure that entity-retrieval functions never return None before iterating over their results. Implement checks or fallback mechanisms to avoid errors such as \u201c'NoneType' object is not iterable.\u201d  \n\u2022 Inventory Verification \u2013 Before attempting to place or supply a structure (e.g. the Laboratory), verify that the required item is actually present in the inventory to prevent placement errors.  \n\u2022 Crafting Dependency Management \u2013 Track and satisfy all prerequisite ingredients for a complex item. Verify that sufficient raw resources and intermediate components (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available prior to initiating Lab crafting to avoid cascading resource errors."}
