{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the boiler and steam engine, facilitating steam flow\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for copper ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for producing copper cables\n- Inserter at Position (x=13.5, y=0.5) for feeding copper plates into the assembling machine\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) to the assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. For example, coal was missing when trying to refuel the boiler.\n\n### Inserter Errors\n- Ensure that inserters have a source item available and a destination with space to deposit items. Inserters may wait indefinitely if these conditions are not met.\n\n### Assembling Machine Input Shortage\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for the assembling machine to function. The machine requires copper plates to produce copper cables, which were missing.\n\n### Furnace Errors\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Furnaces reported having no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for a consistent supply of raw materials."}
