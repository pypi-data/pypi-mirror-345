{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 19.5) - Now operational with water flow\n- **Boiler** at (18.0, 22.5) - Fueled with coal but still missing water input\n- **Steam engine** at (22.5, 22.5) - Fully operational with power output\n- **Secondary offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Remains disconnected\n\n### Oil Production Complex (Critical Update)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Now producing crude oil (219.94 units)\n- **Oil refinery** at (27.5, 40.5) - Powered but showing FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE\n- **Failed pipe connection** between (17.5,40.5) and (27.5,40.5) - Multiple blockage points\n\n### Chemical Production Area (Updated)\n- **Chemical plant** at (37.5, 22.5) - Configured for sulfur but missing inputs\n- **Storage tank** at (32.5, 22.5) - Now connected to pipe network but empty\n- **Output chest** at (40.5, 22.5) - Still unused in production chain\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Pipe Placement Failures (Critical)\n- **Position (18.5,40.5) blockage** - Clear existing entity before pipe placement attempts\n- **Distance limitations** - Move within 10 tiles (current max: 16.28 tiles) before placement\n- **Underground pipe spacing** - Ensure minimum 4-tile spacing between entry/exit points\n\n### Fluid System Initialization\n- **Priming requirement** - Pumpjacks require initial crude oil to establish flow\n- **Empty source connection** - Cannot connect empty fluid sources to chemical plants\n- **Directional validation** - Verify pumpjack output faces UP (current: correct)\n\n### Power Network Optimization\n- **Generator isolation** - Steam engine at 22.5,22.5 producing but not connected to chemical plant\n- **Voltage monitoring** - Current network voltage at 1,794,536 (optimal)\n\n### Connection Protocol\n- **Pre-placement inspection** - Implement tile clearance verification before placement\n- **Adjacent position testing** - Systematically test all adjacent positions when blocked\n- **Entity removal** - Use pickup_entity() before attempting to replace existing pipes\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `connect_fluid_system()` - Requires path clearance verification\n- `verify_power_connection()` - Needs voltage level checks\n\n### Variables\n- `pumpjack_pos` - Operational but connection remains critical failure point\n- `refinery_pos` - Input connection still failing despite crude oil availability\n- `chemical_plant_pos` - Input configuration needs water/petroleum verification\n- `blocked_pipe_pos` - (18.5,40.5) identified as persistent blockage point"}
