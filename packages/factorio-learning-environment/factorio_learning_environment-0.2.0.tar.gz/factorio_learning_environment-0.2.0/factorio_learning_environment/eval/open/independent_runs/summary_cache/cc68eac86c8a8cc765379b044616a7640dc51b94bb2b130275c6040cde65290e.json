{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 4})\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Entity(name='stone-furnace', direction=DOWN, position=Position(x=-14.0, y=-49.0))\n  - Drop Position: Position(x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: [Ingredient(name='iron-ore', count=40000)]\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is free before attempting to place entities like Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables or incorrect references\n- Verify that all variables are correctly defined and referenced in the code. For example, ensure that 'ore_furnace' is defined before use.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items before attempting to insert them into entities. For instance, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills or other production entities to prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors when refueling or inserting items\n- Make sure to have the correct items in your inventory before attempting to refuel or insert them into entities."}
