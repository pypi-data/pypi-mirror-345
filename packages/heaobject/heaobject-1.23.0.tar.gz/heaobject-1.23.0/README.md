# HEA Object Library
[Research Informatics Shared Resource](https://risr.hci.utah.edu), [Huntsman Cancer Institute](https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/), Salt Lake City, UT

The HEA Object Library contains data and other classes that are passed into and out of HEA REST APIs.


## Version 1.23.0
* Made heaobject.root.DesktopObject.super_admin_default_permissions implementations non-final everywhere.
* Added heaobject.root.DesktopObject.get_owner_permissions class method to allow variation in the permissions that an
  object's owner gets (in particular, only heaobject.registry.Collection objects support object creation).
* Added heaobject.root.Permission.non_class_permissions class method.
* Added heaobject.root.NonCreatorSuperAdminDefaultPermissionsMixin class.

## Version 1.22.0
* Replaced heaobject.root.Permission.CHECK_DYNAMIC with a desktop object property,
  heaobject.root.DesktopObject.dynamic_permission_supported.
* Added has_any method to heaobject.root.Permission to simplify checking for whether the current user has any of
  those permissions for a given desktop object.
* Added /*super-admin administrator group to heaobject.group, and added a desktop object property,
  heaobject.root.DesktopObject.super_admin_default_permissions for what permissions the administrator has for an
  object by default. The default implementation returns the empty list. Many desktop object classes override the
  default implementation to return specific permissions.
* Altered heaobject.root.PermissionContext to use the new dynamic_permission_supported and
  super_admin_default_permissions properties.
* Added support for the in operator to the heaobject.root.PermissionGroup protocol and
  heaobject.root.DefaultPermissionGroup class.
* Added group_id_from method to heaobject.root.PermissionContext to convert from a group as represented by the
  heaobject.group module to a heaobject.person.Group id.
* Added the following properties to the heaobject.registry.Resource class: display_in_system_menu,
  display_in_user_menu, and collection_mime_type.
* Fixed heaobject.registry.Resource.manages_creators to accept a string "boolean" value and convert to a boolean.
* Make heaobject.registry.Collection.mime_type read-write.
* New heaobject.setterlogic module with reusable functions for implementing setters. The initial implementation
  supports lists and sets of strings.
* Documented heaobject.person.Person.group_ids.
* Made heaobject.person.Role.id, name, and role raise a ValueError when attempting to set them to the empty string.
* Removed redundant id property implementation in heaobject.person.Group.
* Clarified that the heaobject.person.Group.id and group are expected to have a one-to-one relationship.
* Documented heaobject.person.Group.display_name.
* Made heaobject.person.Group.group raise a ValueError when attemptingn to set it to the empty string.
* Added is_admin_group function to the heaobject.group module.
* Changed the heaobject.group.is_system_group function's parameter name from id_ to group.

## Version 1.21.1
* Addressed bug in determining whether a share applies to a permission context.

## Version 1.21.0
* Fixed regressions in heaobject.root.HEAObject.get_attributes() running under Python 3.10, and improved documentation
  of get_attributes() and related functions.
* Bumped mypy version and dealt with the resulting type checking errors.
* Set check_untyped_defs = True in mypi.ini and fixed resulting errors.
* Added get_groups method to heaobject.root.PermissionContext.
* Added creator_groups and collection_accessor_groups properties and related add/remove methods to
  heaobject.registry.Resource.
* Added is_collection_accessor method to heaobject.registry.Resource.
* Added resource_type_and_id methods to all AWSDesktopObject implementations.
* heaobject.root.PermissionContext is no longer generic.
* heaobject.root.PermissionAssignment now has group and basis attributes that represent group permissions.
* heaobject.root.PermissionAssignment has two new methods: applies_to and get_applicable_permissions.
* Added new regions to heaobject.aws.RegionLiteral.
* Added covariant version of heaobject.root.DesktopObjectTypeVar, called DesktopObjectTypeVar_cov.

## Version 1.20.2
* Make heaobject.trash.AWSS3FolderFileTrashItem not break if the actual_object_type_name is
  heaobject.folder.AWSS3Project.

## Version 1.20.1
* Remove collaborator_id field that mistaken put in folder.

## Version 1.20.0
* Added new field for context path for all SearchItem derived objects.
* Restructured inheritance pattern for AWSS3SearchItemInFolder.

## Version 1.19.0
* heaobject.aws.S3StorageClass has a new attribute, requires_restore, that is True or False depending on whether
  objects with that storage class must be restored prior to being retrieved. This is needed mainly because of the
  Glacier IR storage class, which is an archived storage class but does not require a restore.
* Fixed heaobject.data.AWSS3FileObject.retrievable having the wrong value when the object's storage class is Glacier
  IR.
* Automatically set heaobject.data.AWSS3FileObject.archive_detail_state to
  heaobject.aws.S3ArchiveDetailState.NOT_ARCHIVED when the object's storage_class is set to
  heaobject.data.S3StorageClass.GLACIER_IR.
* Set heaobject.data.AWSS3FileObject.storage_class to None if heaobject.data.AWSS3FileObject.archive_detail_state is
  set to something other than heaobject.aws.S3ArchiveDetailState.NOT_ARCHIVED when the storage class is an archived
  class but does not require a restore to make retrievable. AWS does not permit restoring an object that has the
  Glacier IR storage class.
* Bumped mimetype_description version to 0.1.1, which necessitated a small change to heaobject.mimetype to maintain
  backward compatibility. It has updated mimetype matching logic, which might result in changes to the reported
  mimetype of a desktop object.

## Version 1.18.0
* Created heaobject.aws.S3StorageClassDetailsMixin with attributes to distinguish archived from unarchived objects.
* Added heaobject.root.EnumWithDisplayName.
* Changed heaobject.aws.S3StorageClass enum to inherit from EnumWithDisplayName (no API change).

## Version 1.17.4
* Removed S3EventNameMixin using string literal for event name
* Added copy_old_to_new method to heaobject.activity.DesktopObjectAction to simplify activity handling code.

  argument.

## Version 1.17.0
* Rewrote the heaobject.storage module.
* Added multiple datetime-related utility functions to heaobject.util.
* Added to_bool, get_locale, raise_if_not_subclass, and type_name_to_type to heaobject.util.
* Added a Sentinal class to heaobject.util to distinguish between omitted and None keyword arguments.
* When setting any HEA object attribute with a timezone-naive datetime, the system timezone is now assumed and added to
  the datetime object.
* Refactored Credentials and AWSCredentials.

## Version 1.16.0
* New heaobject.activity.DesktopObjectSummaryView object.
* New heaobject.util.raise_if_none_or_empty_string and raise_if_empty_string functions.
* heaobject.root.is_heaobject_type and is_desktop_object_type now have an optional type_ property.

## Version 1.15.0

* Pulled the AWSCredentials.expiration attribute up to Credentials.
* More flexible API for customizing attribute permissions calculation.
* Added Permission.SHARER to the ACCESSOR_PERMS list.

## Development environment

### Build requirements
* Any development environment is fine.
* On Windows, you also will need:
    * Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019, found at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/. Select the C++ tools.
    * git, found at https://git-scm.com/download/win.
* On Mac, Xcode or the command line developer tools is required, found in the Apple Store app.
* Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12: Download and install Python from https://www.python.org, and select the options to install
for all users and add Python to your environment variables. The install for all users option will help keep you from
accidentally installing packages into your Python installation's site-packages directory instead of to your virtualenv
environment, described below.
* Create a virtualenv environment using the `python -m venv <venv_directory>` command, substituting `<venv_directory>`
with the directory name of your virtual environment. Run `source <venv_directory>/bin/activate` (or `<venv_directory>/Scripts/activate` on Windows) to activate the virtual
environment. You will need to activate the virtualenv every time before starting work, or your IDE may be able to do
this for you automatically. **Note that PyCharm will do this for you, but you have to create a new Terminal panel
after you newly configure a project with your virtualenv.**
* From the project's root directory, and using the activated virtualenv, run `pip install wheel` followed by
  `pip install -r requirements_dev.txt`. **Do NOT run `python setup.py develop`. It will break your environment.**

### Running unit tests
Run tests with the `pytest` command from the project root directory.
