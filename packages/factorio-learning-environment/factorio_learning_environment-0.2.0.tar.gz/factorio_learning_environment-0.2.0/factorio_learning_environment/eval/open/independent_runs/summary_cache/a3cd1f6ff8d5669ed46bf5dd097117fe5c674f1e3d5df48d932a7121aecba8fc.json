Connected to a series of pipes that require further connections.\n- **Pipe Group**: Connects from position (21.5, -10.5) to (20.5, -6.5), currently empty.\n\n### Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Not connected to any fluid systems, with warnings of no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Lab at position (10.5, -4.5)\n- Not powered and has no input materials for research.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the entity you want to place is available in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all the required materials in your inventory before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Errors when trying to find non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to locate exists on the map.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients in furnaces\n- Make sure to have the necessary fuel and ingredients in your inventory before attempting to use a furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the items you wish to insert into a structure in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft without unlocking technology\n- Ensure that you have researched the necessary technology before attempting to craft items that require it.\n\n### Errors when attempting to use unavailable assembling machines\n- Ensure that you have assembling machines available in your inventory before attempting to place or use them.\n\n### Errors due to lack of crafting machines for specific recipes\n- Some items require specific crafting machines or smelting in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when reconnecting pipes\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly aligned and connected to form a complete circuit. Check for any misplaced or missing pipes that could disrupt the connection.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables in code\n- Verify that all variables are properly defined before use. For instance, ensure that 'crafted_poles' is defined before referencing it in your code.\n\n### Errors in connecting pipes to steam engines and boilers\n- Ensure that pipes are properly aligned and connected to both steam engines and boilers. Check for any missing connections or incorrect placements that may prevent fluid flow.\n\n### Errors when attempting to pick up non-existent entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to pick up exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up."}
