{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the electricity network\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for coal storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for additional storage\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at Position (x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs for coal transportation\n- Various belts connecting different positions\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions to distribute electricity\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Steam Pipes\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Verify that there are no missing connections or blockages.\n\n### Boiler Not Working Due to Fuel or Water Supply Issues\n- Regularly check the fuel and water supply to the boiler to ensure it is operational. Ensure pipes are not empty and are correctly connected to the water source.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Electricity Network\n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly connected to the electricity network using small electric poles. Check for any missing connections.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Misplaced Pipes\n- Remove any misplaced pipes that may cause connection issues and ensure proper placement to facilitate fluid flow."}
