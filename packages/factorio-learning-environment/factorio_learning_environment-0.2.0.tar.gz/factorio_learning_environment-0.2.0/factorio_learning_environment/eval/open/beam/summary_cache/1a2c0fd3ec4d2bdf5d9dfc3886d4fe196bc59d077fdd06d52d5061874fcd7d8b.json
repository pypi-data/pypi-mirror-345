{"content": "\"\"\"\nIt appears that I encountered an error when trying to insert the remaining **10 units of iron ore** into the furnace. The error message indicates that there are **no iron ore units available in my inventory**. This suggests that the iron ore I thought was in my inventory was not properly accounted for after the previous operations.\n\n### Current Inventory Status Recap:\n- **Coal**: 5 units\n- **Stone**: 15 units\n- **Iron Plates**: 5 units\n- **Copper Cables**: 18 units\n- **Iron Gear Wheels**: 15 units\n- **Iron Ore**: 0 units (missing)\n\n### Observations:\n- I successfully extracted the iron plates from the furnace, but it seems that the iron ore was not correctly managed during the last operations.\n- The furnace still has **10 units of iron ore**, which means I can continue smelting without needing to add more from my inventory.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Continue monitoring the furnace** to see how many more iron plates it can produce with the remaining iron ore.\n2. **Extract the produced iron plates** as they become available.\n\nLet's wait a bit longer to see how the smelting process progresses and then check the furnace status again.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Sleep for another short period to allow further smelting to progress\nsleep(5)  # Wait for an additional 5 seconds for the smelting process to progress\n\n# Check the status of the furnace again after waiting to see produced iron plates\nprint(f\"Furnace Status after waiting again: {inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)}\")  # Check the state of the furnace after processing\n# Extract the produced iron plates from the furnace if available\nproduced_iron_plates = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity).get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)  # Check how many iron plates are present\nif produced_iron_plates > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace_entity.position, quantity=produced_iron_plates)  # Extract the produced iron plates from the furnace\n\n# Check the final inventory status after extraction\nprint(f\"Current Inventory after extraction: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check current inventory status after extraction from the furnace", "summary_range": "[1-204]"}
