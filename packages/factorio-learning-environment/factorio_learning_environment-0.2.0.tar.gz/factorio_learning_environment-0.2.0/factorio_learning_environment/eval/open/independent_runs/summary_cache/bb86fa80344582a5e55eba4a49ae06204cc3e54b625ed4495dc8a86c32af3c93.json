{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) storing coal (217 units)\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) storing iron ore (789 units)\n\n### Copper Processing Line 1 at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) storing copper ore (140 units)\n\n### Copper Processing Line 2 at (24, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Input wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5) storing copper ore (401 units)\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) storing copper plates (53 units)\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving items from input chest to furnace\n\n### Unused Furnaces at (-10, 20)\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ingredients to operate. Multiple furnaces are showing NO_INGREDIENTS status\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills to prevent work interruption\n- Check if inserters are properly oriented and positioned to effectively move materials between chests and furnaces\n\n### Entity Placement and Configuration\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with source and destination entities\n- When placing inserters, ensure proper orientation immediately to avoid need for later rotation\n- Consider the complete production line layout before placing entities to minimize need for adjustments\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal distribution across burner entities to maintain continuous operation\n- Ensure proper material flow between connected entities in production lines"}
