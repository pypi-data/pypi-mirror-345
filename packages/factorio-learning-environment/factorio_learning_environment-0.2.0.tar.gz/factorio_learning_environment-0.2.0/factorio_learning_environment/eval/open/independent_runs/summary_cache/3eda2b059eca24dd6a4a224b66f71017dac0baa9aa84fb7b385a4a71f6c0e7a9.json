{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected with pipe groups for water and steam flow\n- Currently producing approximately 75 water and 70 steam per minute\n\n### Iron Production Line at (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 76.0) with 50 coal\n- Output inserter at position (18.5, 77.5)\n- Wooden chest for iron plates at position (18.5, 78.5)\n- Additional inserter at position (19.5, 78.5) for further transport\n- Transport belt at position (17.5, 74.5)\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-47.5, 75.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position (-47.5, 75.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (-47.0, 79.0) with 50 coal\n- Output inserter at position (-46.5, 80.5)\n- Wooden chest for copper plates at position (-46.5, 81.5)\n- Additional inserter at position (-45.5, 81.5) for further transport\n- Transport belt at position (-47.5, 77.5)\n- Transport belt at position (-44.5, 81.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Assembly Line at (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position (25.5, 80.5) with copper cable recipe\n- Input inserter at position (23.5, 80.5)\n- Output inserter at position (27.5, 80.5)\n- Wooden chest for copper cables at position (28.5, 80.5)\n\n### Electronic Circuit Assembly Line at (35.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position (35.5, 80.5) with electronic circuit recipe\n- Copper cable input inserter at position (33.5, 80.5)\n- Iron plate input inserter at position (35.5, 78.5)\n- Output inserter at position (37.5, 80.5)\n- Wooden chest for electronic circuits at position (38.5, 80.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on water or occupied tiles\n- Check the terrain before placing entities to ensure there's no water underneath\n- Example: Could not place assembling-machine-2 at (-15.0, 80.0) as entity footprint overlaps water\n\n### Errors with transport belt connections\n- When connecting entities with transport belts, ensure the source and target positions are clear\n- Cannot connect to a chest directly with belts - need to use an inserter as an intermediary\n- Example: Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a Prototype.WoodenChest object as a source\n\n### Errors with inserter placement and connections\n- Ensure inserters' pickup and drop positions are clear before attempting to connect them\n- Check that inserters are properly oriented to pick up from source and drop to target\n- Example: Cannot connect to source inserter drop_position as it is already occupied by another entity\n\n### Errors with entity placement collisions\n- Before placing an entity, check if there are existing entities that might block placement\n- Consider the footprint size of the entity being placed\n- Example: Could not place transport-belt as there is an existing object in the way\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- When connecting belts, ensure there's enough space between entities\n- Consider using underground belts to bypass obstacles\n- Example: Could not place transport-belt next to existing belt with spacing 0 due to collision with furnace"}
