{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), refueled with coal, responsible for mining iron ore.\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), receives iron ore and produces iron plates. Currently has a fuel inventory of coal and is actively working.\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), also receives iron ore and produces iron plates. It is actively working but currently has no fuel inventory.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transfers items between the mining drill and Furnace 1.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), waiting for source items, involved in transferring items from Furnace 2.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), used for storage of iron plates and other materials.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), used for storing iron plates transferred from the furnaces.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transfers items from the mining drill to the storage chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter has a steady supply of source items to transfer. Check the connected entities to ensure they are producing or have the necessary items available.\n\n### No Iron Plates Available in Input Chest\n- Verify that the input chest has a sufficient supply of iron plates. If not, ensure that the production line feeding into the chest is operational and not blocked.\n\n### No Iron Ore Available in Ore Chest\n- Ensure that the mining drill is operational and has sufficient fuel to continue mining iron ore. Check the connections to ensure the ore is being transferred correctly.\n\n### Refueling Issues\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production."}
