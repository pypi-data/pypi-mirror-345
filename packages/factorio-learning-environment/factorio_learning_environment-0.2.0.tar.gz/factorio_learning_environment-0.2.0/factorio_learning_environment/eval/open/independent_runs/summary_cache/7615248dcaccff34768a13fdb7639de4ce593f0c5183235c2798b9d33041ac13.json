{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility (Secondary)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered\n- Multiple Pipe Groups across various positions, primarily empty or not fully connected\n- Electricity Group with small electric poles connecting various entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Boiler and Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly connected between the boiler and the steam engine. Check for any obstructions or incorrect placements that might block the steam output.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Working\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and receiving the necessary input liquid. Ensure that there is fluid present in the connections.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- When connecting pipes, ensure that the start and end positions are correct and that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Check that the inserter is within the range of an electric pole and that the electric network is active to provide power.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces and Mining Drills\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt and that mining drills have fuel and an empty drop position to continue operation."}
