If they are too far, consider relocating them closer to a power source.\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure there is a clear space at the target location before attempting to place an electric pole. If there is an existing object in the way, relocate the object or choose a different position for the pole.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Always check the surrounding area for existing entities before placing new structures to avoid placement failures."}
