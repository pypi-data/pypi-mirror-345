The function takes 3 positional arguments: the two positions to connect and the prototype of the entity to connect with.\n\n### Errors when using connect_entities but being given float values\n -  Make sure to pass integer values to the connect_entities function. The function does not accept float values.\n\n### Errors when using Position object but trying to access 'position' attribute\n -  Make sure to access the x and y attributes of the Position object directly, without trying to access a 'position' attribute.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   Important variables:\n    *   `offshore_pump`: The offshore pump entity.\n    *   `boiler`: The boiler entity.\n    *   `Prototype.Pipe`: The prototype of the pipe entity.\n*   Utility functions:\n    *   `connect_entities`: A function that connects two positions with a pipe entity. It takes 3 positional arguments: the two positions to connect and the prototype of the entity to connect with.\n    *   `print`: A function that prints a message to the console. It takes a string as an argument."}
