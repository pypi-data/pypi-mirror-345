{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation (Updated)  \n- **Burner mining drills**:  \n  - At (16.0, 71.0) (`WORKING`, fuel: 12 coal, output blocked by ground items).  \n  - At (19.0, 71.0) and (22.0, 71.0) (`WORKING`, fuel: 5 coal each, output blocked).  \n- **Stone furnaces**:  \n  - At (16.0, 73.0) (`WORKING`, fuel full: 50 coal, processing iron ore).  \n  - At (19.0, 73.0) and (22.0, 73.0) (`WORKING`, fuel: 49 coal each, low ore input).  \n- **Output system**:  \n  - **Burner inserters** at (19.5, 74.5) and (22.5, 74.5) (`WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`).  \n  - **Wooden chests** at (16.5, 75.5) (153 iron plates), (19.5, 75.5), and (22.5, 75.5) (both 217 iron plates).  \n\n#### Power Generation Setup (Unchanged)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) with connected pipes.  \n- **Boiler** at (-7.0, 0.5) (`WORKING`).  \n- **Steam engine** still unplaced.  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Placement and Proximity Issues  \n- **Entity too far to place**: Repeated attempts to place inserters (e.g., at (16.5, 74.5)) from (0, 0). Move within 10 tiles.  \n- **Blocked placement**: Burner inserter at (16.5, 72.5) failed due to existing objects. Clear tiles before placement.  \n\n#### Inventory Management  \n- **Furnace fuel overflow**: Attempted to insert coal into furnace at (16.0, 73.0) while fuel was full (50/50). Check inventory before inserting.  \n- **Chest overflow**: Manual removal of iron plates from chests at (19.5, 75.5) and (22.5, 75.5). Add output routing (belts/chests).  \n\n#### Production Bottlenecks  \n- **Drill output blocked**: All drills drop ore on ground. Add chests/belts to collect output.  \n- **Inserter inactivity**: Inserters idle due to lack of furnace output. Ensure furnaces are fueled and fed.  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Stabilize fuel supply**: Coal must reach all drills/furnaces to prevent cascading halts.  \n- **Debug tools**: Use `debug` mode to inspect entity connections and item flow.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \nNo new functions or variables were defined.  \n\n---  \n**Key Updates**:  \n- All drills and furnaces now operational but with persistent output blockages.  \n- Chests nearing capacity (217 plates).  \n- Throughput stable at ~57 iron plates/minute."}
