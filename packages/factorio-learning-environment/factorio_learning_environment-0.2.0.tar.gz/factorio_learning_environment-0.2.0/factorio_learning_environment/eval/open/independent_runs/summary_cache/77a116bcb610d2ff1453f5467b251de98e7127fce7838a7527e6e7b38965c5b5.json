For example, wood is needed to craft a wooden chest, and it must be gathered first.\n- Research the necessary technologies before crafting advanced items. For example, the assembling machine requires automation technology to be unlocked.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you are within the maximum distance to place an entity. If the target position is too far, move closer before placing the entity.\n\n### Errors related to furnace operations\n- Make sure to insert the correct type of raw materials into the furnace to avoid operation failures. For example, ensure that coal and iron ore are available for smelting.\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Keep track of your inventory and ensure you have enough items before performing operations that require specific quantities, such as crafting or inserting into chests."}
