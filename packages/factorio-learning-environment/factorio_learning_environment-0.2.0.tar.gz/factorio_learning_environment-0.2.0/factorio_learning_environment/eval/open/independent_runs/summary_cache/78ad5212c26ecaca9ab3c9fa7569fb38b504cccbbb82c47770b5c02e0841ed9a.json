{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Smelting Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Stone Furnace at (41.0, -82.0) processing ores.\n\u2022 Burner Inserter at (41.5, -83.5) transferring furnace output.\n\u2022 Wooden Chest at (41.5, -84.5) storing processed items.\n\u2022 Wooden Chest at (42.5, -81.5) serving as additional storage.\n\n### Lab Setup at position (45.5, -79.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Lab at (45.5, -79.5) receiving automation science packs for research (electrical connection now shows ID 87).\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Production Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Boiler at (42.5, -79.0) fueled with wood, with connection points at (40.5, -78.5) and (44.5, -78.5) and a steam output at (42.5, -81.0). It continues to flag warnings for missing input liquid and connection issues.\n\u2022 Steam Engine (Generator) placed at (48.5, -75.5) with associated connection points at (48.5, -78.0) and (48.5, -73.0); it is not receiving power and displays warnings on missing liquid and unconnected connections.\n\n### Electricity Pole Network\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Small Electric Pole positioned at (48.5, -79.5) adjacent to the Lab.\n\u2022 Small Electric Pole positioned at (46.5, -75.5) adjacent to the Generator.\n\u2022 ElectricityGroup connecting poles at positions (46.5, -75.5), (48.5, -79.5) and (48.5, -80.5).\n\n### Offshore Pump Water Supply Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Offshore Pump placed at (-17.5, 26.5) with a connection point at (-17.5, 25.5) and warnings indicating missing fluid connections.\n\u2022 PipeGroup at approximately (-15.5, 23.5) linking the offshore pump to the boiler\u2019s intended water input; the fluid system registers water output.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Timeout and Undefined Reference \u2013 Ensure that evaluation steps complete within time limits and that all referenced variables (e.g. boiler vs. boiler_entity) are correctly defined prior to use.\n\u2022 Entity Placement Collisions \u2013 When placing entities such as electric poles or offshore pumps, verify that the target locations are free of obstructions and adjust spacing or reference positions as needed.\n\u2022 Insufficient Inventory for Connections \u2013 Verify inventory for required items before attempting connection operations; errors in connecting poles or pipes often stem from missing necessary items.\n\u2022 Resource Acquisition and Crafting Failures \u2013 Address crafting failures by ensuring availability of all required sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, copper-plate, copper-cable, electronic-circuit) and by confirming that production facilities (smelting setups or crafting machines) are properly configured.\n\u2022 Mismatched Resource Queries \u2013 When querying resources (like water patches), use the correct entity references and check that the queried location actually contains the resource."}
