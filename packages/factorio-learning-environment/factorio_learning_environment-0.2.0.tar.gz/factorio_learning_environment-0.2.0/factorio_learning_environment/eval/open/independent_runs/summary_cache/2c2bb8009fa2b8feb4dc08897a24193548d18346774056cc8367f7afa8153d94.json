For example, the lab could not be placed at (0.5, 1.5) due to an obstruction.\n- Verify that you have the required item in your inventory before placing an entity. For instance, a small electric pole could not be placed at (3.5, 0.5) because there were no small electric poles left in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when finding nearest entities\n- If you receive an error stating that a specific entity cannot be found (e.g., \"Could not find nearest small-electric-pole\" or \"Could not find nearest steam-engine\"), ensure that those entities are present on the map and within the search range.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to connect entities. For example, an error occurred while trying to connect a small electric pole to a power source because the necessary item was not available."}
