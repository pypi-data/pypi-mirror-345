{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 3 Burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), (-6, -59)\n- 3 Wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\nAll drills are operational and mining iron ore (39997 resources available)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 4 Stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0)\n- 4 Input burner inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- 4 Coal storage chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- 4 Output chests at positions (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- 1 Output burner inserter at position (0.5, 1.5)\nThe furnaces are fueled with coal but currently lack iron ore input. Some furnaces have produced iron plates (stored in result inventory)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters at occupied positions\n- Before placing inserters, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- The agent tried placing inserters at (6.5, 0.5) and (2.5, 1.0) where entities already existed\n- Consider scanning the area first or maintaining a map of occupied positions\n\n### Furnace efficiency issues\n- The furnaces lack iron ore input despite having fuel\n- Consider adding inserters to feed iron ore from the mining complex to the furnaces\n- Ensure the input/output logistics chain is complete and properly connected"}
