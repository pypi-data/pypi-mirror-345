Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Always check if target location is clear before placing entities\n   - Remove existing entities at target location before placing new ones\n   - Use position checking functions before attempting to place entities\n\n2. Inventory Management\n   - Verify required items are in inventory before attempting placement\n   - Example: Attempted to place long-handed-inserter without having it in inventory\n\n3. Entity Space Requirements\n   - Consider the full space requirement of entities when placing them\n   - Some entities like furnaces require 2x2 spaces\n   - Leave appropriate gaps between entities for inserters and belts\n\n4. System Design Issues\n   - Ensure proper alignment of inserters with their pickup and drop positions\n   - Verify transport chain connections before building complex systems\n   - Test smaller segments before building complete transport chains\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails if location is occupied or item not in inventory\n- rotate_entity(): Changes entity direction. Successfully used for inserter rotation\n\nImportant Variables:\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- belt1: TransportBelt\n- long_inserter: LongHandedInserter\n\nSystem States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Entity is functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Output is blocked\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: No input items available\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: For furnaces without materials\n- EntityStatus.NO_FUEL: For fuel-dependent entities without fuel\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: For transport systems without items\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Default state for storage entities"}
