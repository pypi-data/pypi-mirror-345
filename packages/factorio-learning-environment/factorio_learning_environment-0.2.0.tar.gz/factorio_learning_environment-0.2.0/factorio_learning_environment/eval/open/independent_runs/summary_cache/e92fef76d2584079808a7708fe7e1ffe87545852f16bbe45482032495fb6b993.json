Check the specific coordinates mentioned in the error message.\n- When using `place_entity_next_to`, be mindful of potential collisions with existing entities or items dropped on the ground near the reference entity. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the placement direction if collisions occur.\n\n### Errors when picking up items\n- Auto-pickup (by walking over items) might not always work reliably or"}
