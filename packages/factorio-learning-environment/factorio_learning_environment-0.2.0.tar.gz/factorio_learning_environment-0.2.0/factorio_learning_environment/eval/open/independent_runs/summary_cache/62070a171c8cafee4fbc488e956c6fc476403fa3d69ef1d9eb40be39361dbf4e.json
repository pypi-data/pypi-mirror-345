{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- **Pipe Network** connecting the boiler and steam engine:\n  - Pipes at positions (x=1.5, y=21.5), (x=0.5, y=21.5), (x=2.5, y=21.5), (x=3.5, y=21.5), and (x=-0.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe-to-ground at position (x=16.5, y=17.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for fluid system 19859 at position (x=3.5, y=17.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for fluid system 19870 at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles at positions (x=12.5, y=23.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=21.5, y=27.5), and (x=27.5, y=26.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the connection points between entities are correctly aligned and that there are no obstructions preventing the connection. The error \"Failed to connect {'Pipe'} from pipe at x=1.5 y=21.5 to steam-engine at x=17.5 y=20.5\" suggests a misalignment or obstruction.\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Systems\n- Check that the fluid systems are correctly configured and that all necessary connections are made to allow fluid flow. The steam engine's warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections' indicate a lack of proper fluid supply.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **connect_entities**: A function intended to connect entities such as pipes and steam engines. Failure occurred due to misalignment or obstruction in the connection path.\n- **pipes**: List of pipe entities intended for connection, type: List[Pipe]\n- **boiler.steam_output_point**: Position intended for steam output connection, type: Position\n- **steam_engine**: Target entity for steam connection, type: Entity\n\nImportant Variables:\n- `pipes`: List of pipe entities available for use, type: List[Pipe]\n- `boiler.steam_output_point`: The designated output point for steam from the boiler, type: Position\n- `steam_engine`: The steam engine entity intended to receive steam, type: Entity"}
