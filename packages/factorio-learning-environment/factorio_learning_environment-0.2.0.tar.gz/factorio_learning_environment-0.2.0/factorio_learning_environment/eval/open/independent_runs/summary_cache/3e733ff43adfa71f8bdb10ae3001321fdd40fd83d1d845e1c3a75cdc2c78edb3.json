{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Processing System at (-28, -61) area\nTwo parallel automated mining and smelting lines (unchanged from previous report)\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing System at (-18, -49) area\nTwo mining lines with updated collection system (unchanged from previous report)\n\n### Power Generation System (In Progress) at (-66.5, -97.5)\nUpdated setup of steam-based power generation:\n- Offshore pump at (-66.5, -97.5) - Currently working\n- Boiler at (-61.5, -93.0) - Not connected\n- Multiple pipe groups:\n  - Working water pipe group at (-64.5, -97.5)\n  - Empty pipe groups at various positions: (-63.5, -98.5), (-61.5, -99.5), (-66.5, -94.5), (-63.5, -95.5), (-63.5, -93.5)\n\n### Research Setup\n- Lab placed at (-3.5, -46.5), currently without power (unchanged)\n\n### Additional Processing\nTwo stone furnaces at (0,0) and (2,0) for iron plate production (unchanged)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Connection Errors\n- Ensure you have the required items (like pipes) in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- When connecting fluid systems, plan the pipe layout to ensure continuous connection between source and destination\n\n### Resource Collection Issues\n- Verify the target chest actually contains the items before attempting extraction\n- Check chest inventories before attempting to extract items\n- Consider implementing a waiting mechanism if resources are being actively produced\n\n### Production Chain Issues\n- Ensure all components of a production chain are properly fueled and connected\n- Monitor resource production and consumption rates to maintain steady flow\n- Keep production chains supplied with required raw materials\n\n### Power System Setup\n- Complete water system connections before attempting to start power generation\n- Ensure continuous pipe connections between offshore pump and boiler\n- Verify boiler has both water input and steam output connections properly set up\n\n### Crafting Requirements\n- Remember that iron plates cannot be hand-crafted and require a furnace\n- Plan crafting sequences considering both direct materials and intermediate products\n- Maintain sufficient stock of basic materials needed for crafting\n\n### System Design\n- Leave adequate space between parallel production lines\n- Consider fluid and power distribution paths when planning layout\n- Ensure proper spacing for inserter pickup and drop positions\n- Plan for future expansion when placing initial structures"}
