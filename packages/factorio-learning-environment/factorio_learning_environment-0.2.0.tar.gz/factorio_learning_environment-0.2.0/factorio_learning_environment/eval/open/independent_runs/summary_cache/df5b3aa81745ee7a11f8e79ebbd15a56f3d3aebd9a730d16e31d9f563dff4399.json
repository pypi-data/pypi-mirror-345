{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (9 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (92 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Wooden Chest**: Ensure the target location is not occupied before attempting to place a Wooden Chest. This error occurred multiple times.\n- **Burner Inserter**: Verify that the placement area is clear and suitable for a Burner Inserter. This error was repeated.\n- **Transport Belt**: Check that the desired location for the Transport Belt is free of obstructions and suitable for placement.\n\n### Furnace Production Issues\n- Ensure that the furnace setup is correct and that it has the necessary resources and fuel to continue production. There were instances where the furnace stopped producing iron plates, indicating a setup issue.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drill\n- Address the warning of the output being blocked by an item on the ground. Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent production halts."}
