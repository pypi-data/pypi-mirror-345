{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Station at position(0,0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions(0,0) and (2,0) for smelting iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position(0.5,-1.5) feeding iron ore into first furnace\n- Burner inserter at position(2.5,-1.5) feeding iron ore into second furnace\nBoth furnaces have coal fuel but are currently idle with no ingredients.\n\n### Automated Coal Mining Station at position(41,-82)\nAn automated coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(41,-82) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at position(41.5,-80.5) collecting mined coal (currently contains 74 coal)\n- Burner inserter at position(41.5,-79.5) oriented upward\nThe system is operational with the drill actively mining coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at position(-18,-53)\nAn automated iron ore mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-18,-53) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at position(-17.5,-51.5) collecting mined iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position(-16.5,-51.5) oriented right to feed ore onto transport belts\nThe system is operational with the drill actively mining iron ore.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nA complex belt network connecting the iron ore mining to the smelting area with multiple parallel lines:\n- Mining area connection (-15.5,-51.5) to (-13.5,-52.5)\n- Main transport line from (-17.5,-51.5) to (-13.5,-44.5)\n- Middle section (-9.5,-49.5) to (-7.5,-44.5)\n- Final approach section (-6.5,-46.5) to (-5.5,-42.5)\n- End delivery section (0.5,-8.5) to (2.5,-2.5)\nCurrently transporting small amounts of iron ore through some sections.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Placement and Connection Issues\n- Remove existing belts before attempting to place new ones at the same position\n- Ensure you have transport belts in inventory before attempting to create connections\n- When rebuilding belt networks, clear problematic sections completely before reconstruction\n- Verify belt orientations match the intended flow direction\n\n### Resource Extraction Issues\n- Move to the correct position before attempting to extract items\n- Verify the target entity exists and contains the desired resource\n- Check container inventories before attempting extraction\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Remove blocking entities before placing new structures\n- Verify space is available for new entity placement\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in mining drills and inserters\n- Maintain adequate fuel distribution to all machines\n- Keep track of iron ore production and transport\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before construction\n- Maintain sufficient materials for planned belt connections\n- Keep track of available resources for crafting needs\n\n### System Configuration\n- Verify correct orientation of inserters relative to belts and chests\n- Monitor automated system status regularly\n- Ensure proper connections between system components"}
