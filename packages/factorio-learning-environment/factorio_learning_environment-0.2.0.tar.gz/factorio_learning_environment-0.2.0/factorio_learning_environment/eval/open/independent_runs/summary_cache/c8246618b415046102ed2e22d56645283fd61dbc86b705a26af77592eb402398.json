{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- The mining drill is currently out of fuel, and the furnace has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- The mining drill is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have sufficient items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines. The error at step 863 occurred because there was no coal available in the inventory to insert into the iron drill.\n\n### Errors Due to Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of your mining drills and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Both the copper and iron mining drills, as well as the furnaces, frequently ran out of fuel.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) is currently out of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure the source inventory has the required items before calling this function to avoid errors.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.
