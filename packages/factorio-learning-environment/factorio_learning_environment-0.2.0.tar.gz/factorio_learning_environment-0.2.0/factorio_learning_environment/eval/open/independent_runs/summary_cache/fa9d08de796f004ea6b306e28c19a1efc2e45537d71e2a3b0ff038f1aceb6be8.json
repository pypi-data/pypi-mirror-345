{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore from the ground. It is currently fueled with coal and operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest is used to store the extracted iron ore from the mining drill. It currently contains iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is aligned to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is fueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it is currently not receiving iron ore and is not operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and aligned to transfer items from the source (wooden chest) to the destination (stone furnace). Regularly check the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Chest\n- Before attempting to extract items from a chest, ensure that the chest contains the items. Attempting to extract when the chest is empty or the quantity is zero will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with Full Chest\n- Monitor the chest's capacity to prevent it from becoming full. If the chest at the drop position of the mining drill is full, it will halt the mining operation. Regularly empty the chest to maintain continuous mining.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to operate. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, check the inserter setup and ensure that the chest has iron ore available for transfer."}
