{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: Out of fuel\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Drop Position: (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Resources: 10,000 units of iron ore\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Position (5.5, -60.5): Contains 183 iron plates\n  - Position (4.5, -58.5): Contains 494 iron ore\n  - Additional chests at positions (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5) each containing 183 iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Position (-4.5, -52.5): Contains 500 iron plates\n  - Position (-5.5, -52.5): Contains 232 iron ore\n  - Position (-2.5, -52.5): Contains 200 iron ore\n- **Iron Chest**:\n  - Position (-3.5, -52.5): Contains 1,476 iron plates\n\n### Smelting Facility\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Position (-15.0, -48.0): Fueled with 15 coal, contains 34 iron plates, no ingredients to smelt\n  - Position (-13.0, -48.0): Fueled with 11 coal, contains 34 iron plates, no ingredients to smelt\n  - Position (-11.0, -48.0): Fueled with 10 coal, contains 1 iron plate, no ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills are adequately fueled to continue operations. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Errors due to Full Storage\n- Regularly monitor the storage capacity of chests. Empty chests that are full to prevent halting of mining operations.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients for Smelting\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials to process. Check and maintain the supply chain to avoid interruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the final inventory state with quantities of items like 'wooden-chest', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
