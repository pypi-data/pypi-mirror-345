Check for any obstructions or entities occupying the intended location before attempting to place the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established. Ensure that the offshore pump is connected to the steam engine and that all necessary pipes are in place to facilitate fluid flow.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the electricity network. Check that small electric poles are correctly placed to provide power to inserters, labs, and other entities.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Supply\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and replenish fuel supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage inventories to prevent chests from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
