{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) that is actively mining coal.\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) that is receiving coal from the burner mining drill. Note that this chest is currently full, which may hinder further mining operations.\n  \n### Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) that is currently not operational due to lack of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to full chest**: The wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) is full, which prevents the burner mining drill from depositing coal. To mitigate this, ensure that the chest is emptied regularly to allow for continuous mining.\n  \n- **Errors when the burner mining drill runs out of fuel**: The burner mining drill has shown instances of not collecting more coal due to an empty inventory. Always ensure that the burner mining drill has sufficient fuel to operate effectively.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: None reported.\n  \n- **Variables Assigned**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: object (type: BurnerMiningDrill)\n  - `wooden-chest`: object (type: WoodenChest)\n  - `stone-furnace`: object (type: StoneFurnace)"}
