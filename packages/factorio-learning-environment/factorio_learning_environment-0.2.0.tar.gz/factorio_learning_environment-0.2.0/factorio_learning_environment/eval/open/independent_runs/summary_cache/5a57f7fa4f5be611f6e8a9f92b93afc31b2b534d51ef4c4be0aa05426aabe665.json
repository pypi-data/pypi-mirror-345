{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Steam engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Pipe groups connecting various components:\n  - Pipe group at position (-4.5, 16.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe group at position (-9.5, 23.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT\n  - Pipe group at position (-7.5, 24.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe group at position (-4.5, 24.5) - Status: EMPTY\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS/WORKING (varies across steps)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity group at position (-3.67, 20.21) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure the target location for placing pipes is not overlapping with water or other entities. Relocate to a suitable position before attempting to place pipes.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Verify that the required items (e.g., pipes, pipe-to-ground) are available in the inventory before attempting to place or connect them.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available before attempting to craft items. For example, iron plates are required for crafting certain items and must be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### API Misuse Errors\n- Double-check the API attributes and methods being used. For example, ensure that the correct attribute names are used, such as 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround'.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that preconditions, such as having sufficient resources (e.g., iron ore for smelting), are met before executing related operations.\n\n### Type Errors\n- Ensure that functions requiring specific data types (e.g., integers) are provided with the correct type of arguments."}
