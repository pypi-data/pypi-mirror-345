{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and another at position (-18.0, -70.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) and another at position (-17.5, -64.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions to facilitate movement of copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connectivity\n- Ensure belts are correctly aligned and oriented to connect properly. Double-check the orientation and position of belts before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. Check the supply chain to ensure that items are being delivered to the inserters.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary to avoid production halts.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Verify the supply chain to ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces."}
