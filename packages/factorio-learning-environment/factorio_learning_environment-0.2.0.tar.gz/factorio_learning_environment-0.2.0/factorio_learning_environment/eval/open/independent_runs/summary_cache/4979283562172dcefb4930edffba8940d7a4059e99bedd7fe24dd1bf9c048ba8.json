{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Smelting Setup at y=0\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at position (0, 0) - Currently working, processing iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone furnace at position (4, 0) - Currently working, processing iron ore into iron plates\nBoth furnaces are fueled with coal and contain iron ore for processing.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when trying to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Before attempting to place entities (like burner mining drills), ensure you have crafted or obtained the required entity first\n- Check inventory contents before placement attempts to avoid placement failures\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items requiring sub-ingredients\n- When crafting complex items like burner mining drills, ensure all sub-ingredients are either in inventory or can be crafted directly\n- For items requiring smelted materials (like iron plates), these must be obtained from furnaces rather than trying to craft them directly\n- Plan the crafting sequence to first obtain base materials before attempting to craft more complex items"}
