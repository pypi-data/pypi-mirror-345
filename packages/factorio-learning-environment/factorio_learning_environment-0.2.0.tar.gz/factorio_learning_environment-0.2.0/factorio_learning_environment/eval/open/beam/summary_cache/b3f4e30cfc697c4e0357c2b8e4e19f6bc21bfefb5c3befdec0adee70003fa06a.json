{"content": "I see we're having consistent issues with the furnace being full but showing empty contents. Let's try a different approach - let's look at the other furnaces we have and try to use one that isn't full:\n\n```python\n# Get all furnaces and check their status\nfurnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nprint(\"Checking all furnaces:\")\nfor i, furnace in enumerate(furnaces):\n    print(f\"\\nFurnace {i} at {furnace.position}:\")\n    print(f\"Status: {furnace.status}\")\n    print(f\"Warnings: {furnace.warnings}\")\n    print(f\"Fuel: {furnace.fuel}\")\n    print(f\"Source: {furnace.furnace_source}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {furnace.furnace_result}\")\n\n# Let's try to find a furnace that's not full and has no warnings\nworking_furnace = None\nfor furnace in furnaces:\n    if not furnace.warnings and furnace.status != \"NO_FUEL\":\n        working_furnace = furnace\n        break\n\nif working_furnace:\n    print(f\"\\nFound usable furnace at {working_furnace.position}\")\n    \n    # Move to it and try to use it\n    move_to(working_furnace.position)\n    \n    # Check what we have\n    print(f\"My inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n    \n    # Try to insert materials\n    if Prototype.IronOre in inspect_inventory():\n        insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, working_furnace, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added iron ore\")\n        \n    # Wait and check results\n    print(\"Waiting for smelting...\")\n    sleep(10)\n    print(f\"Furnace contents after waiting: {inspect_inventory(working_furnace)}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nNo suitable furnace found. Current inventory:\", inspect_inventory())\n```\n\nThis will help us understand what's happening with all the furnaces and hopefully find one we can use. If we can't find a working furnace, we might need to try clearing one first or building a new one.", "summary_range": "[1-3552]"}
