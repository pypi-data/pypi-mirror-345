{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and an iron-ore source inventory. The furnace is currently full with iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and an iron-ore source inventory. The furnace is actively working.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (x=-14.0, y=-49.0).\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to an iron chest.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-9.5, y=-44.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-43.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) with an inventory of iron-ore and iron-plates.\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5) with an inventory of iron-ore and iron-plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) with an empty inventory.\n- **Transport Belts**:\n  - Belt at position (x=-16.5, y=-47.5) outputting towards (x=-16.5, y=-46.5).\n  - Belt at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) outputting towards (x=-14.5, y=-47.5).\n  - Belt at position (x=-12.5, y=-46.5) outputting towards (x=-11.5, y=-46.5).\n  - BeltGroup connecting various belts for material transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that there is sufficient inventory of the item you wish to insert before attempting to supply it to a furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Check that the source inventory contains items that can be picked up by the inserter, and ensure the inserter is correctly positioned to access the source items.\n\n### Errors when furnaces are full\n- Regularly check the output inventory of furnaces to ensure they are not full, which can halt production. Consider adding more storage or processing capacity if needed."}
