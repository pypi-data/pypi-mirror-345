{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\n- The lab is used for conducting research and requires power to operate.\n\n### Small Electric Pole at position (13.5, 10.5)\n- This small electric pole provides power to the lab at (10.5, 10.5).\n\n### Small Electric Pole at position (16.5, 10.5)\n- This small electric pole provides additional power to the surrounding area.\n\n### Small Electric Pole at position (20.5, 10.5)\n- This small electric pole provides additional power to the surrounding area.\n\n### Small Electric Pole at position (6.5, 0.5)\n- This small electric pole provides additional power to the surrounding area.\n\n### Furnaces\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) - Status: Working, Fuel: Coal\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) - Status: No Ingredients, Fuel: Coal\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 2.0) - Status: No Ingredients, Fuel: Coal\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\n- This wooden chest is used for storing items, currently containing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure there is a clear space available before attempting to place a small electric pole. If an existing object is in the way, you will not be able to place it.\n\n### Errors when connecting to power sources\n- Make sure to check for the nearest power source (like a steam engine or solar panel) before attempting to connect entities. If no power source is found, the connected entity will not function.\n\n### Errors when running out of inventory items\n- Keep track of your inventory and ensure you have enough small electric poles before attempting to place them. If you run out, you will not be able to place additional poles.\n\n### Errors when the lab has no power\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. If the lab status shows NO_POWER, check the connections and the availability of power sources nearby."}
