For example, the error \"KeyError: 'electricity-group'\" suggests that the entity attribute was incorrectly referenced. Verify the correct attribute names in the documentation or entity API.\n\n### Errors When Accessing Non-Existent Attributes\n- Avoid accessing attributes that do not exist on an object. The error \"AttributeError: 'ElectricityGroup' object has no attribute 'prototype'\" indicates that the 'prototype' attribute does not exist for the 'ElectricityGroup' object. Double-check the object structure and available attributes before accessing them."}
