{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line\nA large smelting setup for processing iron ore into plates, consisting of:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at positions (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0)\n- Input system:\n  - 4 Wooden chests at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), and (6.5,-2.5) containing coal\n  - 4 Burner inserters at (0.5,-1.5), (2.5,-1.5), (4.5,-1.5), and (6.5,-1.5) moving materials from input chests to furnaces\n- Output system:\n  - 4 Wooden chests at (2.5,1.5), (4.5,1.5), and (6.5,1.5) for collecting processed plates\n  - 6 Burner inserters at (0.5,1.5), (1.5,1.5), (3.5,1.5), and (5.5,1.5) moving processed plates from furnaces to output chests\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to pick up non-existent entities\n- Before attempting to pick up an entity, verify that it exists at the specified position\n- Example: Attempting to pick up burner-inserter at (2.5,1.5) failed because no such entity was present\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items\n- Example: Attempting to insert 50 iron ore failed because there was no iron ore in inventory\n\n### Resource management tips\n- Keep track of resource quantities in inventory\n- Ensure required materials are available before attempting operations\n- Consider implementing inventory checks before resource-consuming operations"}
