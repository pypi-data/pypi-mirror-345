{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)  \nConsists of the following entities:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.  \n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.  \n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace.  \n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.  \n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.  \n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt.  \n- Transport belt at position (21.5, 73.5) moving iron plates away from the chest.  \n\nThis structure forms a connected iron plate production line from ore extraction to plate output onto a belt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel management and inserter operation  \n- Always ensure burner inserters and furnaces have sufficient coal fuel to operate. Lack of fuel causes entities to stop working (EntityStatus.NO_FUEL).  \n- Insert coal into all burner inserters and furnaces regularly to maintain continuous operation.  \n- Track inventory carefully to confirm coal availability before attempting to insert fuel; insertion commands fail if inventory is empty.  \n\n### Item insertion and inventory tracking  \n- Attempts to insert items (coal) into entities failed multiple times due to empty inventory. Maintain an accurate inventory count before insertion attempts to avoid exceptions.  \n- When extracting items from chests, verify the chest contains the required items to avoid failed extraction attempts.  \n\n### Entity placement constraints and positioning  \n- Entity placement failed when trying to place wooden chests or burner inserters due to lack of items in inventory or target tiles being occupied.  \n- Placement of burner inserters failed when the target position was too far from the player position (max distance 10 tiles). Move closer before placing entities.  \n- When placing entities near existing ones, ensure the target tile is free and spacing or direction is adjusted to avoid overlaps.  \n- Reposition entities by first picking them up before placing again to fix placement issues.  \n\n### Inserter status issues  \n- Inserters may wait due to lack of source items or lack of space in the destination inventory/belt. Ensure upstream entities produce items and downstream entities or belts have capacity to receive items.  \n- Monitor inserter statuses to diagnose production line blockages and fuel shortages.  \n\nNAMESPACE  \nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
