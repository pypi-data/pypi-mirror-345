{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions for water and steam transport\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=56.5, y=-83.5)\n- BeltGroup transporting coal from Position (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to Position (x=48.5, y=-86.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=0.5, y=0.5) containing iron plates\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=1.5, y=0.5) containing coal\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5) containing coal\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various positions, currently not connected to power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from halting due to full chests. For example, the chest at Position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Errors with Power Network\n- Connect the steam engine to the power network to ensure it is operational. Currently, the steam engine at Position (x=7.5, y=39.5) is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Management\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly connected and that there is fluid present in connections. The steam engine is not receiving input liquid, indicating a possible disconnection or blockage in the fluid system.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Check that inserters have a clear path to source items. The burner inserter at Position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a possible issue with item flow or positioning."}
