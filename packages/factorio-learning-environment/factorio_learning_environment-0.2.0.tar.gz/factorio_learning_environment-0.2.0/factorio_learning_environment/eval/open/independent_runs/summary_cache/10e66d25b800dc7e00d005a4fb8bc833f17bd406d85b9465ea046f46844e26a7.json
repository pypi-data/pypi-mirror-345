{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with a fuel inventory of 6 coal.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with a fuel inventory of 5 coal.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with a fuel inventory of 11 coal.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Multiple wooden chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5) with varying inventories of iron plates.\n  \n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0) with a fuel inventory of 7 coal and a drop position at (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional wooden chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting. The burner mining drill at (4.0, -60.0) has stopped due to a full chest at (4.5, -58.5).\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials. The stone furnaces at (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) have warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the player's current inventory, including items like wood, coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels."}
