{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with a current status of NO_INGREDIENTS.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) with an inventory containing 50 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 3.5)) with an inventory containing 50 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 5.5)) with an empty inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. For example, the wooden chest at (3.5, 5.0) could not be placed because the agent was too far away.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources\n- Gather the necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For instance, the crafting of the wooden chest failed because the agent did not have enough wood.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without unlocking the recipe\n- Research the required technology before attempting to craft items that depend on it. The steel chest could not be crafted because the Steel Processing technology was not unlocked.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the target entity has the capacity to accept items before inserting. For example, the furnace had no ingredients to smelt at times, indicating it was not ready to process items."}
