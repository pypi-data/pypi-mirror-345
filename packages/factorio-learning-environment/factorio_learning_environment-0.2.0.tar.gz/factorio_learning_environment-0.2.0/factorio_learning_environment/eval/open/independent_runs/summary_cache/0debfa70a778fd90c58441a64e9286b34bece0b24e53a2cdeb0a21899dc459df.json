{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Station at (2.0, 2.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (2.0, 2.0) that is currently processing iron ore into iron plates. The furnace has no ingredients to smelt but contains 4 iron plates in its result inventory and has 3 coal as fuel.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (16.0, 4.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (16.0, 4.0) placed on a coal deposit. The drill is currently working, has 4 coal as fuel, and is set to drop resources at position (16.5, 5.5). The drill is mining from a coal deposit with approximately 40000 coal remaining.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items that require smelting\n- Items like iron plates cannot be crafted directly and must be smelted in a furnace\n- Remember to extract the finished products from the furnace before trying to use them in crafting\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have crafted or acquired the entity before attempting to place it (e.g., wooden chest)\n- Check your inventory before attempting to place structures\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without gathering required raw resources\n- Raw resources like stone must be gathered from the map before crafting items that require them\n- Make sure to gather all necessary raw resources before attempting to craft complex items"}
