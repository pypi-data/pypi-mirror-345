{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Processing Unit at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to power network\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n\n### Power Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions including (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (7.5, -59.5), and others, providing electrical connectivity to structures\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at Position (7.5, -61.5) with no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure there is enough iron ore in the storage chest before attempting to transfer to the furnace.\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specific position before attempting to access it. For example, ensure a lab exists at Position (7.5, -61.5) before trying to interact with it."}
