{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (52.0, -82.0) with a warning: output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (53.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (52.5, -79.5) with a warning: chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (52.5, -78.5) to continue mining.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (52.5, -78.5) with a warning: chest is full.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-12.0, -51.0) with warnings: out of fuel, chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to continue mining.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) with a warning: no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, -49.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -46.5) with a warning: inserter waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -45.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Manual Extraction Errors\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity before attempting manual extraction to avoid extraction failures.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that source items are available and not blocked upstream. Verify that the connected entities are functioning correctly and that there are no blockages.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockages.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities are regularly refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n- Important variables assigned:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory with quantities of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
