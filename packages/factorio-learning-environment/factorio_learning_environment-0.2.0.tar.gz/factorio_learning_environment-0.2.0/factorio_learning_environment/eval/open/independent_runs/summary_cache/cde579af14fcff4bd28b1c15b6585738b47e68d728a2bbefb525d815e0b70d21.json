{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Furnace at position (4.0, -60.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (4.0, -60.0): Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently contains 18 coal as fuel and 8 iron ore as input. The furnace is in a \"working\" state, actively smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Furnace at position (7.0, -60.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (7.0, -60.0): Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently contains 9 coal as fuel and no iron ore. The furnace is in a \"no ingredients to smelt\" state, indicating it lacks iron ore for further smelting.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Repeated extraction attempts without checking entity status\n- The agent repeatedly attempted to extract iron plates from the furnace at (4.0, -60.0) without verifying if the furnace had produced any. This led to multiple errors. Always check the furnace's output status before attempting extraction.\n\n#### Errors due to insufficient smelting inputs\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel and the required ingredients (e.g., iron ore) before starting the smelting process. The furnace at (7.0, -60.0) is currently idle due to a lack of iron ore.\n\n#### General tips for avoiding placement and extraction errors\n- Always check the inventory for required items before placing entities.\n- Verify the contents and status of entities before attempting to extract items.\n- Monitor the smelting process to ensure the furnace has both fuel and ingredients to avoid timeouts.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, the agent tried to place a stone furnace without having one in its inventory.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities that do not contain the expected items\n- Verify that the entity contains the items you are trying to extract before attempting extraction. The agent repeatedly tried to extract iron plates from the furnace before it had produced any, leading to multiple errors.\n\n#### Successful extraction after resuming smelting\n- After inserting 10 iron ore into the furnace at (4.0, -60.0), the agent successfully extracted 1 iron plate. This demonstrates the importance of ensuring the furnace has sufficient inputs before attempting extraction."}
