{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that is waiting for space in destination\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) that contains coal\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that is waiting for source items\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that contains iron ore\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is working and contains iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to fuel depletion**: \n  - Ensure burner mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check the fuel status and refill as necessary.\n  \n- **Errors when using inserting but being too far**: \n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to insert items before attempting to insert.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: \n  - Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked yet.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron_ore`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n  - `iron_gear_wheel`: int\n  - `wood`: int"}
