Check the status of power poles and connections.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to inventory issues\n- Ensure that you have the required entities in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, you cannot place a steam engine or solar panel if they are not present in your inventory.\n\n### Errors with solar panel dimensions\n- Verify that the dimensions for solar panels are set as integers. Check prototype definitions to ensure that the width and height are correctly defined.\n\n### Errors when using attributes that do not exist\n- Double-check the attributes of objects you are working with. For example, the ElectricityGroup object does not have a 'voltage' attribute, which caused an error. Ensure you are accessing the correct attributes for each object.\n\n### Errors when crafting due to insufficient materials\n- Always check your inventory for required materials before crafting. For example, ensure you have enough copper plates, steel plates, and electronic circuits before attempting to craft solar panels or electronic circuits.\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Make sure all variables used in your code are defined before use. For instance, the variable 'crafted_panels' was referenced without being defined, leading to a NameError."}
