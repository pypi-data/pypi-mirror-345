{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -84.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Connected transport belts forming a BeltGroup to facilitate ore movement.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items, transferring items between chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting, currently without ingredients.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, transferring items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Stale Entity Data\n- Ensure that entity data is refreshed and valid before accessing or modifying it to avoid stale data errors.\n\n### Errors with Attribute Access on BeltGroup\n- Verify that objects have the correct attributes before attempting to access them. In this case, ensure that the object is not a BeltGroup when trying to access attributes like `prototype`.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with source entities and that the source entities have items available for transfer. Check for full chests or incorrect inserter positioning.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply lines and ensure that the input chests or belts are adequately stocked with raw materials."}
