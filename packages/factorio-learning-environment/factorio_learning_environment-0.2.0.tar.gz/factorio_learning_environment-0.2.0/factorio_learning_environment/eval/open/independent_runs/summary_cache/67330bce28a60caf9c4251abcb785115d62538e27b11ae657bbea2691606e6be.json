{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that the pipes are placed correctly and that there are no obstructions between the boiler and steam engine. Check the connection points and ensure they align properly.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with power supply to entities\n- Check that all entities requiring power are connected to a power source and that the power source is operational. Ensure that there are no breaks in the power network."}
