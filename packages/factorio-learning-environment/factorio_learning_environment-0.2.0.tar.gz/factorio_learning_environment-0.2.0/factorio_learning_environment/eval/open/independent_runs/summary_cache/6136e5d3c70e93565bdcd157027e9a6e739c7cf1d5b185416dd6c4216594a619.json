{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (10,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (539 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Status: Working, but out of fuel\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Inventory: Iron plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Regularly check the setup if the furnace is not receiving materials.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Always ensure that inserters and mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly refuel these entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in the inventory to avoid operation failures."}
