{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully built on the map. Multiple recovery attempts were made to supply\u2014and ultimately craft and place\u2014a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for research support, but all placement operations failed due to missing inventory and resource shortages. Other facilities (for example, the furnaces used for iron and copper smelting at positions (5.0, 5.0) and (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were only employed as part of resource processing and were not created as new multi\u2010entity structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API call errors \u2013 When retrieving entities, incorrect parameters were used:\n  - Using a keyword argument \u201cradius\u201d in get_entities resulted in an unexpected keyword error.\n  - Passing positional arguments to get_entities when none are expected led to a \u201ctakes 0 positional arguments\u201d error.\n  Ensure the function\u2019s signature is verified and call it using the appropriate parameters.\n  \n\u2022 Placement and inventory verification \u2013 Attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed because no Lab was present in the inventory.\n  Verify the availability of required inventory items before initiating placement commands.\n  \n\u2022 Handling null responses \u2013 Iterating over the result of get_entities sometimes produced a \u201cNoneType object is not iterable\u201d error.\n  Always check for a null or None response before attempting to iterate over returned entities (or default to an empty collection).\n  \n\u2022 Resource and sub-ingredient shortages \u2013 Crafting failures for the Lab were triggered by missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, and even basic smelted products like iron-plate and copper-plate).\n  Confirm that all prerequisite items and intermediate production steps are fully satisfied before attempting to craft complex structures.\n  \n\u2022 Fallback error handling \u2013 Recovery routines that attempt to craft or place a Lab should include robust checks on both the inventory and response data, ensuring that fallback approaches (such as substituting an empty list when no entities are detected) are correctly implemented and trigger appropriate resource management adjustments."}
