{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Facility at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron ore and coal.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Facility at position (x=-15.0, y=-47.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-47.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-47.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=-16.5, y=-44.5) for transferring items between furnaces and chests.\n\n#### Coal Mining Facility at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for storing coal.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Facility at position (x=-15.0, y=-45.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-45.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5) for transferring items between furnaces and chests.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces or other entities. For example, if you are trying to insert iron ore into a furnace, make sure you have iron ore in your inventory.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace has finished smelting and has items available for extraction before attempting to extract. For example, if you are trying to extract iron plates, make sure the furnace has completed the smelting process.\n\n#### Errors when inserting coal into drills or furnaces\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into drills or furnaces. For example, if you are trying to insert coal into a burner mining drill, make sure you have coal in your inventory.\n\n#### Errors when placing items into occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. For example, if you are trying to place a furnace, make sure the tile is not already occupied by another entity.\n\n#### Errors when using inserters\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and has the necessary fuel (coal) to operate. For example, if an inserter is not transferring items, check its fuel level and positioning relative to the source and destination entities.\n\n#### Errors when extracting from chests\n- Ensure the chest contains the items you are trying to extract. For example, if you are trying to extract iron ore from a chest, make sure the chest has iron ore available."}
