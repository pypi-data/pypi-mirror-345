{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) with a warning of output blockage due to a full chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) connected to the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) with a warning of a full chest at drop position.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) with a full inventory of coal (800 units).\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) with a warning of a full chest at drop position.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) containing iron ore (302 units).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests have enough space to accept items from inserters or mining drills. Regularly check and empty chests to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Resources\n- Make sure to be in proximity to the target entity when attempting to manually extract resources. Ensure the entity is not blocked or full.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities connected to inserters are producing items. Check for blockages or missing items in the production line.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory with items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
