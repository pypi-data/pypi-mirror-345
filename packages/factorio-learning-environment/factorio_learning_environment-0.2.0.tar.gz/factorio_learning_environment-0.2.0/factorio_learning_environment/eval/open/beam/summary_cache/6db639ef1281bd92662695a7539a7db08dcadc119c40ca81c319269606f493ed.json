The updated inventory now includes:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 8 pieces of wood\n- 8 pieces of coal\n- 5 pieces of iron ore\n- 5 pieces of copper ore\n- 3 pieces of iron plates\n\n### Current Situation:\nWith the addition of wood, I now have a broader range of resources to work with. However, many crafting recipes remain disabled, including those for stone bricks and essential items like copper plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check for Crafting Options with Wood**: I can explore if there are any crafting recipes that utilize wood, such as wooden chests or other basic items.\n2. **Investigate Further**: If wood crafting options are also disabled, I may need to explore the map for more resources or entities that could provide additional crafting paths.\n3. **Assess the Environment**: If there are any nearby structures or entities, I can interact with them to see if they offer any new recipes or crafting opportunities.\n\nLet\u2019s check if I can craft any items using the wood I just gathered.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check if I can craft wooden items or other basic items using wood\nwooden_chest_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.WoodenChest)\nprint(f\"Recipe for Wooden Chest: {wooden_chest_recipe}\")\n\n# Attempt to craft wooden chests if the recipe is enabled\nif wooden_chest_recipe and wooden_chest_recipe.enabled:\n    craft_item(Prototype.WoodenChest, quantity=2)  # Attempt to craft a couple of wooden chests\n\n# Check the inventory after attempting to craft wooden chests\nfinal_inventory_post_wooden_chest = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory after crafting wooden chests: {final_inventory_post_wooden_chest}\")  # Verify what is available now.", "summary_range": "[1-116]"}
