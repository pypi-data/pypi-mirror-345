Note that despite the connection attempts\u2014including direct linking to the steam engine\u2014the lab remains without power.\n\n### Steam-Powered Electricity Generator at position(11.5, 9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(11.5, 9.5) used for generating electricity (currently issuing warnings: not connected to power network, no input liquid, and no fluid present in connections).\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) for extracting water.\n- Boiler at position(-6.0, 24.5) designed to heat water and produce steam (status now FULL_OUTPUT after successful pipe connection).\n- Pipe group (fluid system 96) linking the offshore pump to the boiler using pipes. Initial connection attempts failed due to insufficient pipes but subsequent additional pipe crafting secured a working fluid connection.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n- Entity Placement and Inventory Availability:\n  - Confirm that required entities exist in inventory before attempting placement (e.g. assembling machine 1 placement failed because none were available).\n  - Ensure target locations are unoccupied to avoid placement errors.\n\n- Crafting Prerequisites and Resource Management:\n  - Verify that all sub-ingredients and production methods (such as furnace smelting for iron plates) are available when crafting composite items like pipes.\n  - Ensure technology prerequisites are met\u2014advanced items such as assembling machine 1 require prior research (automation technology) before they can be crafted.\n  - Maintain accurate counts of raw materials and intermediary products to support crafting needs.\n\n- Connection Resource Verification:\n  - Check that sufficient connection materials (for example, pipes for fluid networks) are available before initiating connections.\n  - Reassess resource availability if repeated connection failures occur.\n\n- Power Supply and Technology Unlock:\n  - Supply a stable power network to labs to enable research progress and unlock advanced recipes.\n  - Verify that power connections not only exist but are properly configured to overcome NO_POWER status in critical structures.\n\n- Variable Definition and Reference:\n  - Ensure that all entity variables are defined and referenced correctly before their properties are used in placement or connection operations."}
