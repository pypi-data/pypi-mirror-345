Use the active fluid_system identifier (33476, as evidenced by the updated boiler and offshore pump) when supplying water to the steam engine.\n- Rigid Pipeline Stabilization Delay:\n  \u2022 The fixed 10-second wait for pipeline stabilization is causing unnecessary delays. Replace static delays with dynamic connectivity checks to continue immediately once proper stabilization is confirmed."}
