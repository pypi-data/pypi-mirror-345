{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 1 at (x=8.5, y=13.5)\n- Iron gear inserter at (x=8.5, y=11.5)\n- Iron gear chest at (x=8.5, y=10.5)\n- Output inserter at (x=10.5, y=13.5)\n- Output chest at (x=11.5, y=13.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-4.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (x=-4.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler at (x=-4.5, y=16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting water and steam\n- Electric pole network distributing power\n\n### Mining and Smelting Setups\nMultiple mining and smelting stations at:\n1. Station at (x=41.0, y=-82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\n2. Station at (x=-28.0, y=-61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (x=-27.5, y=-59.5)\n   - Burner inserter and furnace setup\n\n3. Station at (x=-18.0, y=-53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest and inserter system\n   - Stone furnace at (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n\n4. Furnace at (x=14.0, y=14.0)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - common collisions with:\n  - Transport belts\n  - Wooden chests\n  - Electric poles\n  - Stone furnaces\n- Increase spacing parameter when placing entities next to existing ones\n- Consider different directions when initial placement fails\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - implement better fuel management\n- Ensure proper resource flow in automation science pack production line\n- Monitor and maintain fuel levels in burner inserters and furnaces\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- Verify proper spacing and layout before placing production line components\n- Ensure input/output logistics are properly configured\n- Consider removing misplaced entities before attempting new placements\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Monitor power stability and fuel supply to boilers\n- Ensure proper fluid connections between offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine"}
