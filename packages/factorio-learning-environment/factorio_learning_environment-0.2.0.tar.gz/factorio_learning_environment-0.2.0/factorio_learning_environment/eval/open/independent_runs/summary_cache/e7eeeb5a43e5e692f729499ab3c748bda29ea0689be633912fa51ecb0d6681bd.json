{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently researching logistics\n\n### Pipe Network\nMultiple PipeGroups are present, connecting various fluid systems, some of which are currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles distributed across various positions to supply power to connected entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Automation Science Packs\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients, such as copper plates, are available in sufficient quantities and are processed in a furnace or crafting machine before attempting to craft automation science packs.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and mining drills to prevent interruptions in operations. Ensure that fuel sources are replenished timely to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Monitor the inventory of chests and ensure they are not full to avoid halting mining operations. Regularly transfer resources from full chests to maintain efficiency.\n\n### Errors in Smelting Operations\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt, and that the output is being collected or transferred to avoid production halts."}
