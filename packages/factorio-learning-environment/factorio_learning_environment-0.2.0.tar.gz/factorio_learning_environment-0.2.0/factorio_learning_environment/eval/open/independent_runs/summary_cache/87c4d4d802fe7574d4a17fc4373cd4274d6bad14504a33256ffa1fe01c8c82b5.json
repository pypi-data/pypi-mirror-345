{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-14.5, 14.5)\nLatest attempt at building a power system consists of:\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 14.5) facing DOWN\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups attempting to connect the system\nCurrently not functioning properly due to blocked connection points between components\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) with drop position (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) containing 4 coal\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel in mining drill\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) with drop position (-20.5, -71.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) containing 2 coal and 14 copper plates\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel in mining drill\n\n### Smelting Area near Origin\nGroup of furnaces each containing 23 coal:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab containing 10 automation science packs\nCurrently not functioning due to lack of power\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing steam engines, ensure there is sufficient clear space considering the entity's tile dimensions (3x5 tiles)\n- Check for existing objects or entities before attempting placement\n- Consider the orientation and connection points when placing power system components\n\n### Power System Connection Issues\n- Connection points between entities must be unblocked for proper fluid flow\n- Ensure proper spacing and alignment between power system components\n- Verify steam engine and boiler orientations match the intended flow direction\n- Create water connections before placing steam components to ensure proper routing\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drills and furnaces need constant fuel supply to operate\n- Ensure proper spacing between mining drills and their target furnaces\n- Maintain fuel levels in all burner devices to prevent operation interruption\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Electric poles must be properly connected to form a complete power network\n- Ensure power consumers (like labs) are within range of electric poles\n\n### Pipe System Management\n- Remove existing pipe groups before attempting new connections to avoid conflicts\n- Verify fluid system connections are complete before adding new components\n- Create direct, minimal pipe connections to reduce complexity and potential blockages"}
