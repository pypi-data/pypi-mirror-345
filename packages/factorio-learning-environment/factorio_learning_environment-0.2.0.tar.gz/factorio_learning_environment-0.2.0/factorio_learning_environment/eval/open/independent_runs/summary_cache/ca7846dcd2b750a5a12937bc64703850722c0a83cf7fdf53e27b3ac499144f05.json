{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there's enough space available before attempting to place a wooden chest or stone furnace. Check for existing entities or terrain obstacles that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that iron and copper mining drills have access to ore resources. If no ore is available, consider relocating the drills to a position with available resources.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- When attempting to retrieve an entity, ensure that the entity exists at the specified position. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity type matches.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in unplaceable terrain\n- Avoid placing entities in areas that are unplaceable, such as water or occupied tiles. Verify the terrain and clear any obstructions before placement.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- Utility Functions:\n  - `place_entity`: Attempts to place an entity at a specified position. Ensure the target location is clear of obstacles and suitable for placement.\n  - `get_entity`: Retrieves an entity from a specified position. Ensure the entity exists at the given coordinates before attempting retrieval.\n\n- Important Variables:\n  - `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity.\n  - `new_copper_drill_position`: Position where the copper mining drill is intended to be placed.\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: Inventory count of burner mining drills available for placement."}
