{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, including positions (21.5, -10.5), (20.5, -10.5), (22.5, -10.5), (20.5, -9.5), (20.5, -8.5), (20.5, -7.5), (20.5, -6.5), (20.5, -5.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (24.5, -7.5), (24.5, -6.5), (22.5, -4.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (7.5, 5.5) and (9.5, 5.5)\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5)\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-3.5, 0.5), (-3.5, 2.5), (8.5, 5.5), (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Inserters at Positions (-3.5, 1.5), (7.5, 5.5), (9.5, 5.5)\n- Transport Belts at Positions (10.5, 5.5), (9.5, 6.5), (8.5, 6.5), (10.5, 6.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. Check if the source container or belt has the required items available for the inserter to pick up.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Make sure that the furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Check the supply chain to ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Assembling Machine Missing Resources\n- Verify that the assembling machine has all the required ingredients to produce the desired item. In this case, ensure that copper plates are available for copper cable production.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to prevent interruptions in steam production."}
