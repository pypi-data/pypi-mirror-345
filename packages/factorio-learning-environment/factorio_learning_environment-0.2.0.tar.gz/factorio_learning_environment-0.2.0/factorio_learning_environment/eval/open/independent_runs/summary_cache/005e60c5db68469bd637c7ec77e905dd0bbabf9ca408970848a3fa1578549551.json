Always add and use an inserter (or similar input device) as the connection target.\n\u2022 When placing an entity (for example, a wooden chest), verify that the target position is within the allowed placement range. If the target is too far (as indicated by distance-related errors), move closer before attempting placement.\n\u2022 Prior to placement actions, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory to prevent \u201cno item in inventory\u201d errors.\n\u2022 Check variable names and references carefully to avoid NameError issues (for instance, ensuring that a defined target chest variable is used consistently)."}
