{"content": "The recent attempts to interact with the active furnace have resulted in further complications, as outlined below:\n\n### Error Summary:\n1. **Extraction of Stone**: The extraction process indicated that the active furnace is empty, yet the overall inventory still reflects that there is **1 piece of stone** remaining. This suggests that the extraction did not succeed as expected.\n  \n2. **Inserting Copper Ore**: An error occurred when trying to insert **1 piece of Copper Ore**, indicating that the furnace cannot accept the copper ore because it believes it still contains stone.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not functioning correctly and does not accurately reflect its contents, leading to repeated failures when trying to process materials.\n- The furnace is recognized as an active entity, but it is still not processing correctly, causing a blockage in operations.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Force Clear the Furnace**: I will attempt to forcefully clear all contents from the furnace to ensure it is completely empty.\n2. **Recheck Status**: Once cleared, I will confirm the status of the furnace.\n3. **Load Proper Materials**: After confirming the furnace is empty, I will insert the required **5 pieces of stone** and **1 piece of Copper Ore**.\n\nLet's begin by forcefully clearing the active furnace of any contents. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Attempt to extract all contents from the active furnace \nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, furnace_status, quantity=1)  # Extract the remaining piece of stone\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_force_extraction = inspect_inventory(furnace_status)  # Inspect the status after extraction from the furnace\noverall_inventory_after_force_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check the total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after force extraction: {active_furnace_status_after_force_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after force extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after force extraction: {overall_inventory_after_force_extraction}\")  # Total after operations. \n\n# Since the extraction has now removed stone, let's confirm the furnace is empty.\n# If empty, proceed to load 5 pieces of stone and 1 piece of Copper Ore again.\nif overall_inventory_after_force_extraction[Prototype.Stone] == 0:  \n    insert_item(Prototype.Stone, furnace_status, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 pieces of stone into the active furnace\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace_status, quantity=1)  # Insert copper ore for processing\n\n# Check overall furnace inventory and player inventory again to see if they were updated accordingly\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_reinsertion = inspect_inventory(furnace_status)  # Check the furnace status after insertion attempt\noverall_inventory_after_reinsertion = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone and copper ore.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after re-insertion attempt: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_reinsertion}\")  # Output current furnace status after attempt\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after re-insertion attempt: {overall_inventory_after_reinsertion}\")  # Output total inventory after attempt \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-448]"}
