{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). The drill is currently working but the chest at the drop position is full, which requires emptying to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (5.5, -60.5)\n  - (7.5, -60.5)\n  - (6.5, -60.5)\n  - (9.5, -60.5)\n  - (8.5, -60.5)\n  - (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore\n  - (-14.5, -50.5)\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (-15.0, -48.0), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates\n  - (-13.0, -48.0), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates\n  - (-11.0, -48.0), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from halting due to a full chest.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that there are sufficient ingredients (iron ore) available in the furnaces to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning. Regularly check and replenish the iron ore supply in the furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n- **Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
