Ensure that the item object supports the accessed attributes (avoid using, for example, item.prototype_name on a string) to prevent AttributeError.\n  \n\u2022 Steam Engine Repositioning:\n  - Prior to repositioning the steam engine, verify that candidate pipe groups with the specified fluid system are present within the defined search radius. Repeated repositioning attempts using fluid_system values [74564, 74812, 74978, 75062, 75144, 75228] have failed; adjust search parameters or examine the spatial layout and configuration of nearby pipeline infrastructure."}
