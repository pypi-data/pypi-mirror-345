{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0), currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0), currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0), currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5), empty inventory.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5), not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5), containing 227 iron plates.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of 12 automation science packs, currently not receiving power.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with no input liquid and not connected.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) with no input liquid and not connected.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5) working and connected to pipes.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 11.5), status empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 19.5), status empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 23.5), status empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (-10.5, 24.5), status full output with water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 116328, voltage 0.\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 116338, voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that the pipes are properly aligned and connected to the intended entities. Double-check the positions and ensure there are no gaps in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Pole Connection\n- Verify that electricity poles are within range to connect to each other and the intended entities. Ensure that the poles are placed correctly and are not overlapping or incorrectly indexed.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to both the boiler and the electricity network. Check for any missing connections or misalignments in the setup.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the electricity network to ensure that inserters are within range of powered electric poles. Verify that the poles are connected to a power source and that the network is active."}
