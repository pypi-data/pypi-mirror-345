{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n- Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n\n### Iron Ore Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5) filled with iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests are not full to prevent mining operations from halting. Regularly check and empty chests to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to smelt. Monitor the input inventory of furnaces to avoid downtime.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron ores in storage.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron plates in storage.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the number of coal units available for fueling operations."}
