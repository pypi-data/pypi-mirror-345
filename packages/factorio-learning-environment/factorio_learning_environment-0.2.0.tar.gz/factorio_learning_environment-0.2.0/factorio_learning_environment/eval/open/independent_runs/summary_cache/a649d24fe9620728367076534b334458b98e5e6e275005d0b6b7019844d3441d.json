{"content": "I'll generate a report based on the provided logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Upper storage iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n- Intermediate wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for coal transfer\n- Transport belt system from (42.5, -80.5) to (43.5, -80.5) facing right\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area (around x=47-50, y=-80 to -81)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Unused Belt System\n- Long belt group from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5) facing upward, currently empty\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing new entities, check if the target location is already occupied\n- Remove existing entities before attempting to place new ones in the same location\n- Ensure there is enough clearance around the target location for the entity's full footprint\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- When extending belt systems, verify the entire path is clear before placement\n- Consider the entity sizes when planning belt layouts - some entities like furnaces take up 2x2 tiles\n- Check that terrain is suitable for placement (avoid water tiles)\n\n### Inserter Placement\n- When placing inserters, ensure both pickup and drop positions are within reach\n- Verify there is enough space for the inserter to rotate and operate\n- Consider the direction of inserters relative to the containers they interact with\n\n### System Design\n- Plan the complete layout before starting construction to avoid frequent repositioning\n- Leave adequate space between production lines for future expansion\n- Consider using direct insertion where possible instead of complex belt systems\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `belt_extension`: TransportBelt\n- `belt_upper`, `belt_lower`: TransportBelt\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n\n### Entity States\n- `EntityStatus.WORKING`: Entity is functioning normally\n- `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`: Entity lacks required materials\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`: Entity waiting for input materials\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION`: Entity cannot output due to full destination\n- `EntityStatus.NORMAL`: Entity in normal operational state\n- `EntityStatus.EMPTY`: Entity contains no items"}
