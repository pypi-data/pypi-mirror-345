{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storing extracted resources.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-5.5, -50.5) storing processed iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure chests have enough space before attempting to store items. Consider using larger storage solutions or distributing items across multiple chests to prevent overflow.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to ensure continuous operation. A full chest will halt mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore: int` - Represents the quantity of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate: int` - Represents the quantity of iron plates produced and stored.\n- `coal: int` - Represents the quantity of coal used as fuel for furnaces and mining drills."}
