{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Burner Mining Drills at positions (x=38.0, y=-87.0), (x=41.0, y=-87.0), and (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with associated Burner Inserters and Wooden Chests for coal collection.\n- BeltGroup transporting coal from (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5).\n\n### Electricity Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Steam Engines at positions (x=-13.5, y=12.5), (x=23.5, y=15.5), (x=-9.5, y=17.5), (x=-2.5, y=18.5), (x=13.5, y=19.5), (x=25.5, y=20.5), (x=-5.5, y=23.5), (x=7.5, y=23.5), (x=8.5, y=29.5), (x=2.5, y=31.5), (x=3.5, y=36.5), (x=18.5, y=46.5), (x=23.5, y=49.5), (x=28.5, y=49.5), (x=37.5, y=51.5), (x=9.5, y=57.5), (x=22.5, y=56.5), (x=29.5, y=56.5), (x=42.5, y=56.5), (x=16.5, y=58.5).\n- Boilers at positions (x=6.5, y=20.0), (x=-13.5, y=24.0), (x=-10.5, y=24.0), (x=-13.5, y=26.0), (x=3.5, y=27.0), (x=8.5, y=38.0).\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5).\n- PipeGroups connecting various components, including positions (x=-13.5, y=15.5), (x=11.5, y=21.5), (x=5.5, y=26.5), (x=-1.5, y=28.5), (x=5.5, y=36.5).\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (x=9.5, y=41.5), (x=16.5, y=41.5), (x=17.5, y=40.5).\n\n### Copper and Iron Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-26.0, y=-61.0) and (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting copper and iron plates.\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x=1.5, y=1.5) with automation science packs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure that the target tile is clear of any existing objects before attempting to place a pipe. Check for obstructions at positions like (x=2.5, y=26.5), (x=3.5, y=26.5), etc.\n\n### Errors with disconnected entities\n- Verify connections between boilers, steam engines, and the power network to ensure they are properly connected and receiving necessary inputs. Many entities are marked as `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED`.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure the correct position and existence of entities like the Offshore Pump before attempting to retrieve them. No entity of type offshore-pump was found at position (x=4.5, y=20.5).\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `get_entity`: Attempts to retrieve an entity at a specified position. Failed to retrieve Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=20.5) due to non-existence.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `water_source_position`: Position variable used for locating the Offshore Pump, type: Position.\n- `inventory`: Current inventory status, type: dict with keys as item names and values as counts."}
