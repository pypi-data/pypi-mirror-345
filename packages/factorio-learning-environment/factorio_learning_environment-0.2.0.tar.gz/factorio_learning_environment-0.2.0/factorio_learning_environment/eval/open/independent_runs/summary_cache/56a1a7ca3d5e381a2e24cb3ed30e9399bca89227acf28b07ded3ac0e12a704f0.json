{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, including pipes and underground pipes at positions (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), etc.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) connected to power network\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) storing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5) for additional storage\n\n### Power Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions including (17.5, -0.5), (1.5, 25.5), etc., connecting inserters and other electrical entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure no existing entity occupies the target position before placing pipes or underground pipes. Remove any existing entities first.\n- Verify that the target location for underground pipes is suitable and not obstructed by terrain or other entities.\n\n### Boiler Not Connected\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to both the water source and the steam engine. Check all pipe connections for continuity.\n\n### Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Check the power network to ensure all inserters are connected to a powered electric pole. Ensure electric poles are connected and receiving power.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly extract iron plates from the furnace to prevent production halts due to full output inventory.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check the supply chain for any blockages or shortages."}
