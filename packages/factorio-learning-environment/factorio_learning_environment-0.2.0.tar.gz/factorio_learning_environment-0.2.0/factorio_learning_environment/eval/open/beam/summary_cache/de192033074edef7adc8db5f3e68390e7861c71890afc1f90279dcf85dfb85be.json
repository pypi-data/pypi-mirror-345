If obstructed, try a different position.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Specify the type of connection you want to make when connecting entities, such as using a transport belt for item transport.\n- Ensure that connection points are not blocked by other entities or terrain.\n\n### Errors When Placing Offshore Pump\n- Ensure the offshore pump is placed adjacent to a water source and is available in your inventory before placement.\n\n### Errors When Crafting Boiler\n- Gather the necessary raw resources, such as stone, to craft a stone furnace, which is a prerequisite for crafting a boiler.\n\n### Errors When Placing Boiler\n- Ensure the boiler's footprint does not overlap with water or other entities. Choose a suitable location for placement.\n\n### Errors When Crafting Steam Engine\n- Ensure all sub-ingredients like pipes are crafted before attempting to craft a steam engine. Pipes require iron plates, which need to be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Power Infrastructure\n- Ensure all components of the power infrastructure are properly connected and not blocked by other entities or terrain. Reposition entities if necessary to establish connections.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities Without Required Items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities, such as pipes for connecting a boiler to an offshore pump or steam engine.\n\n### Errors Due to No Coal in Inventory\n- Regularly check your coal inventory and gather more if necessary to ensure continuous operation of boilers and furnaces.\n\n### Errors When Setting Research\n- Verify the current research status before"}
