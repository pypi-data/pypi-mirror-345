{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\n- **Location**: Centered around position x=-15.0, y=-50.0\n- **Components**:\n  - **Burner Mining Drill** at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n  - **Wooden Chests** at Position(x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and Position(x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storage.\n  - **Burner Inserters** at Position(x=-13.5, y=-48.5) and Position(x=-14.5, y=-47.5) for transferring materials.\n  - **Stone Furnaces** at Position(x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and Position(x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - **Additional Wooden Chests** for storing iron plates at various positions including Position(x=-6.5, y=-48.5), Position(x=-6.5, y=-49.5), Position(x=-7.5, y=-48.5), Position(x=-5.5, y=-48.5), Position(x=-4.5, y=-48.5), and Position(x=-3.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- **Location**: Various positions along y=-48.5\n- **Components**:\n  - **Wooden Chests** at multiple positions for storing iron plates, including Position(x=-6.5, y=-48.5), Position(x=-6.5, y=-49.5), Position(x=-7.5, y=-48.5), Position(x=-5.5, y=-48.5), Position(x=-4.5, y=-48.5), and Position(x=-3.5, y=-48.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity when attempting to extract items. This will prevent extraction failures.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Regularly check and clear blockages at inserter drop positions to maintain smooth operation. Ensure that destination containers have enough space to accommodate incoming items.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Shortage\n- Monitor the furnaces for ingredient shortages. Ensure that there is a continuous supply of raw materials to avoid idle furnaces.\n\n### Extraction Quantity Errors\n- When extracting items, ensure the specified quantity is available in the source entity to avoid extraction failures. Adjust the quantity based on available inventory."}
