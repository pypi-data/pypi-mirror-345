{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. Although the agent attempted to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to support research, the placement failed due to inventory and resource issues. Existing facilities such as the furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and the copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) were accessed for smelting but were not newly constructed structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage\n  - When calling get_entities, use the correct signature. Avoid including unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \"radius\") or supplying extra positional arguments that violate the API\u2019s expectations.\n\n\u2022 Entity Retrieval and Iteration\n  - Before iterating over the results from get_entities, confirm that the return value is not None to prevent \"NoneType is not iterable\" errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement\n  - Verify that a Lab is present in the inventory before attempting to place one. This helps prevent placement failures due to missing items.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Dependencies\n  - Ensure all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available before starting Lab crafting. Strengthen upstream production and resource management (e.g., smelting sufficient iron and copper plates) to meet these dependencies and avoid repeated crafting failures."}
