{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to harvest additional stone has been successful, but the active furnace still indicates issues with processing:\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- **Overall Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **2 pieces of stone** available (after harvesting)\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace still holds **18 Iron Plates** and is now showing a status of **\"NO_INGREDIENTS\"**, indicating it is unable to process due to a lack of required materials.\n- The furnace is still in a **\"WORKING\"** state but is not engaged in any smelting activity, and it has warnings indicating it lacks the necessary ingredients to operate.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not recognizing the stone or Copper Ore as valid inputs for smelting, which suggests there may be a configuration or input issue.\n- The furnace is currently set to smelt Iron Plates, but it cannot process anything without the correct ingredients.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Stone into the Furnace**: I will attempt to load the **2 pieces of stone** into the furnace to see if it recognizes them.\n2. **Load Copper Ore into the Furnace**: After confirming the stone is accepted, I will load the **1 piece of Copper Ore**.\n3. **Monitor for Smelting Activity**: After these operations, I will check if the furnace begins the smelting process.\n\nLet's proceed by loading the stone into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the available stone into the active furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Insert 2 pieces of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_loading_stone = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_loading_stone = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading stone: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_loading_stone}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading stone: {overall_inventory_after_loading_stone}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-326]"}
