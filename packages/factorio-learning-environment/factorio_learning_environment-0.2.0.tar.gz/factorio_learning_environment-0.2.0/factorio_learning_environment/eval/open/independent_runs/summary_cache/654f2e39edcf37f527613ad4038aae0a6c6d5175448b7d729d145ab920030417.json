{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5), (8.5, 1.5), (17.5, 1.5), (19.5, 1.5).\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), (20.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) connected using underground pipes.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-11.5, 26.5) not connected.\n- Steam Engine at position (35.5, 27.5) not connected to power network.\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 23.5) connecting offshore pumps.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup at position (17.5, 3.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 11.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 18.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (18.5, 21.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (22.5, 20.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 22.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (14.5, 22.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (16.5, 23.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (-5.5, 25.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (7.5, 24.5).\n\n### Lab\n- Lab at an unspecified position with no power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe and Boiler Connections\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are correctly aligned and connected with pipes. Verify that the path is clear and the entities are placed correctly before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Connections\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly positioned and connected to the pipe network. Ensure there is a clear path for the connection.\n- Avoid placing pipes where the entity footprint overlaps water.\n\n### Errors with Entity Pickup\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that the correct arguments are provided. If the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument should be None.\n- Ensure that a valid Position object is provided when required.\n\n### Errors with Position Argument\n- When connecting entities or using functions that require a position, ensure that a valid Position object is provided as the second argument.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Operations\n- Before attempting to insert or extract items, ensure that the necessary items are available in the inventory or the target entity contains the required items."}
