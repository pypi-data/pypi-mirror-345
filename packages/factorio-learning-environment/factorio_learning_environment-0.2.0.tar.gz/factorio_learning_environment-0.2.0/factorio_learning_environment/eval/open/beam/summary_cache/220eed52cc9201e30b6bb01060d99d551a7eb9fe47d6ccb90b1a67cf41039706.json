{"content": "The error indicates that the attempt to find a resource patch at the specified position (0, 0) failed because there are no resources of that type in that location. This suggests that the initial position may not contain any resources, which is a common issue when starting in a new game or environment.\n\n### Summary of Attempts:\n1. I tried to locate resources by checking various resource types in a loop starting from the position (0, 0).\n2. The attempt to retrieve a resource patch for coal failed, indicating that there are no resources at that location.\n\n### Tips to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Dynamic Positioning**: Instead of starting at a fixed position (0, 0), consider using the `nearest` function to find the closest resource of each type dynamically. This way, you can ensure you're checking valid locations.\n   \n2. **Resource Availability Check**: Before attempting to get a resource patch, check if the resource exists in the vicinity using a broader search radius or by checking multiple positions.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to catch exceptions when trying to access resources. This can help gracefully manage situations where resources are not found.\n\n4. **Exploration**: If starting fresh, consider moving in a specific direction (e.g., right or down) to explore the map for resources rather than relying on a single point.\n\n5. **Use of Resource Types**: Ensure that you are correctly referencing the resource types and that they are available in the environment. If unsure, check the documentation or available resources before making calls.\n\n### Revised Approach:\nInstead of starting at (0, 0), I will attempt to find resources by moving to a nearby location first and then checking for resources. Here\u2019s a suggested approach:\n\n1. Move to a nearby position (e.g., (1, 1)).\n2. Use the `nearest` function to find the closest resource of each type.\n3. If resources are found, proceed with gathering them; if not, continue exploring.\n\nBy following this approach, I can avoid the fixed position issue and increase the chances of finding resources.", "summary_range": "[1-34]"}
