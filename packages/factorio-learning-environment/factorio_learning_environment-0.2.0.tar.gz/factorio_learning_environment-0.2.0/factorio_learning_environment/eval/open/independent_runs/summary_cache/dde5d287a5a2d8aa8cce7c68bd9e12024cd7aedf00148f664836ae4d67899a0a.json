{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Plate Production Line at y=1.0\nConsists of three stone furnaces with automated output collection:\n- Stone furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) - idle with 24 coal\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) - idle with 36 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (1.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from first furnace, 49 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (3.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from second furnace, 37 coal\n- Collection chest at position (1.5, 3.5) - containing 62 iron plates\n- Collection chest at position (3.5, 3.5) - containing 56 iron plates\n- Collection system addition:\n  - Collection chest at position (5.5, 3.5) - empty\n  - Burner inserter at position (5.5, 2.5) with 19 coal, waiting for source items\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line at y=7.0\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel with automated output collection:\n- Stone furnace at position (2.0, 7.0) - idle, with 38 coal\n- Stone furnace at position (4.0, 7.0) - idle, with 18 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (2.5, 8.5) - configured to extract from first furnace, 36 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (4.5, 8.5) - configured to extract from second furnace, 18 coal\n- Collection chest at position (2.5, 9.5) - containing 56 copper plates\n- Collection chest at position (4.5, 9.5) - containing 87 copper plates\n\n### Power Generation System\nExpanded power generation infrastructure:\n- Offshore pump at position (-3.5, 27.5) - actively pumping water\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0) - loaded with 4 coal, processing water to steam\n- Steam engine at position (-3.5, 21.5) - not connected to steam supply\n- Water pipe system connecting offshore pump to boiler - operational\n- Multiple pipe groups at various positions:\n  - PipeGroup at (-1.5, 21.5) - empty, 10 pipes\n  - PipeGroup at (3.5, 21.5) - empty, 14 pipes\n  - PipeGroup at (8.5, 21.5) - empty, 6 pipes\n  - PipeGroup at (-1.5, 24.5) - contains steam, 5 pipes\n  - PipeGroup at (-2.5, 26.5) - contains water, 5 pipes\n  - Several other smaller pipe groups at various positions\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors with pipe connections\n- Ensure pipes are in the inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Even after crafting pipes, they need to be in the active inventory slot when making connections\n- When connecting steam systems, verify the path is clear and within reach\n\n### Errors with direct crafting of plates\n- Iron plates and copper plates cannot be directly crafted\n- Must use furnaces to smelt ore into plates\n\n### Errors with pipe connections\n- Ensure required pipes are in inventory before attempting connections\n- Craft pipes before starting connection attempts\n- Plan pipe routes and required quantities before starting steam connections\n\n### Previous Error Tips Still Relevant\n[All previous error tips remain valid and should be included as they are still applicable to current operations]"}
