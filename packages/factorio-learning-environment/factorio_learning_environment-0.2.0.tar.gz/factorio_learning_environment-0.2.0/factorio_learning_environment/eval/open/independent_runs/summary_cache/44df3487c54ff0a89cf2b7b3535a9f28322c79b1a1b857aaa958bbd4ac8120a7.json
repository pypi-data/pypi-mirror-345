{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around position 41, -82)\n- Burner mining drill at (41, -82) mining coal\n- Connected to input wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around position 46, -81)\n- Two stone furnaces at (45, -81) and (47, -81)\n- Input wooden chest at (45.5, -79.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) facing UP\n- Iron plate storage chest at (49.5, -80.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other objects\n- Multiple failed attempts to place inserters due to existing objects at positions (45, -80), (45.5, -80.5)\n- Consider checking entity dimensions and ensuring adequate spacing between components\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drill is showing \"out of fuel\" warning - implement fuel management system\n- Output chest for mining drill is full - need to implement chest emptying logic\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - need to ensure proper material flow\n\n### System Design\n- Consider implementing checks for chest capacity before continuing operations\n- Add monitoring for fuel levels in burner inserters and furnaces\n- Implement proper material flow management between storage chests and processing units\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `first_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `second_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n\n### Functions\n- `place_entity()`: Places entities at specified coordinates\n  - Success: Returns placed entity\n  - Failure: Throws exception when target location is occupied\n- `rotate_entity()`: Changes entity orientation\n  - Success: Entity faces new direction\n  - Failure: Not observed in logs\n\n### Important State\n- Multiple chests with different contents:\n  - Coal storage: 1600 units in iron chests\n  - Iron plate storage: 1500 units in wooden chest\n  - Various empty buffer chests"}
