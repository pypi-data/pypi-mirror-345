{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) - Extracts iron ore (output blocked)\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 74.0) - Smelts iron ore into plates (no ingredients)\n- **Burner inserter** at (16.5, 75.5) - Transfers plates from furnace to chest\n- **Wooden chest** at (17.5, 75.5) - Stores smelted iron plates\n- **Wooden chest** at (15.5, 75.5) - New ore storage\n\n### Copper Mining Setup\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) - Extracts copper ore (output blocked)\n- Connected to power network via small electric pole at (-44.5, 68.5)\n\n### Power Generation Setup\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Pumps water\n- **Boiler** at (-6.0, -0.5) - Heats water into steam using coal\n- **Steam engine** at (-0.5, -0.5) - Generates electricity from steam\n- Connected pipe network between pump, boiler and engine\n- Power network connected to both mining drills\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts\n- Repeated attempts to place chests at occupied positions (15.5,73.5), (15.5,74.5)\n- Always check for existing entities before placement\n- Remove blocking entities first when repositioning\n\n### Belt connection errors\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to chests - use inserters as intermediaries\n- This occurred when trying to connect iron drill output to chest\n\n### Inserter placement issues\n- Failed to place burner inserter due to existing chest at (15.5,73.5)\n- Plan inserter positions carefully considering adjacent entities\n\n### Output blockage warnings\n- Both mining drills show \"output blocked\" warnings\n- Ensure output paths are clear and connected to valid destinations\n\n### Furnace operation issues\n- Furnace shows \"no ingredients\" warning\n- Verify ore input path is properly connected\n\n### Power system notes\n- The power network is functioning correctly\n- No new power-related errors occurred in these steps"}
