{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Neighbors: Wooden Chest (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Wooden Chest (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), Burner Inserter (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fueled with coal, currently full with iron ore and iron plates\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Transfers items from the mining drill to Stone Furnace 1\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fueled with coal, currently lacks ingredients to smelt\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Transfers items from Stone Furnace 2 to a Wooden Chest\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5)\n  - Serve as storage for iron plates and other resources\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or furnace) contains items for the inserter to transfer. Regularly check and refill the source entities as needed.\n\n### Errors with No Iron Plates Available in Input Chest\n- Monitor the production and transfer of iron plates to ensure that input chests have a sufficient supply. Consider optimizing the production line to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors with No Iron Ore Available in Ore Chest\n- Ensure that the mining drills are operational and have a continuous supply of fuel to maintain a steady flow of iron ore to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Use inserters to automate the transfer of finished products to storage chests.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Blocked\n- Check for blockages in the inserter's drop position and clear them promptly. Ensure that the destination entities have space to accommodate incoming items."}
