{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (19.5, 0.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (20.5, 0.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (not specified), currently researching logistics\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 11.5) with status EntityStatus.EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 23.5) with fluid 'water' and status EntityStatus.WORKING\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 22.5) with fluid 'steam' and status EntityStatus.WORKING\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 25.5) with status EntityStatus.EMPTY\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 14.5), (1.5, 2.5), (1.5, 10.5), (1.5, 6.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the path between entities like offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines is clear of obstructions before attempting to connect pipes.\n- Verify that the correct type of pipe (e.g., regular pipe vs. underground pipe) is being used for the intended connection.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Placement\n- Check for placement blockages that might prevent successful pipe connections. Clear any obstructions before attempting to place pipes.\n\n### Steam Engine Power Generation Issues\n- If the steam engine is not generating power, ensure that all connections are properly established and that there is a sufficient supply of water and fuel to the boiler.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for construction and connection tasks."}
