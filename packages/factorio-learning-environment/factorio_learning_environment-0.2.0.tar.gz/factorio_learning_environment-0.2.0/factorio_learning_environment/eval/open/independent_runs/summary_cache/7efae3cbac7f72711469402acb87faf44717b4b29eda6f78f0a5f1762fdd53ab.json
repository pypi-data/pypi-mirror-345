{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a report summarizing the existing structures and error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-2.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-8.5, 24.5) facing up\n- Water pipe network connecting pump to boiler\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 14.5)\n- Steam pipe network attempting to connect boiler to steam engine\n\n### Manufacturing Area\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 4.0), and (6.0, 4.0)\n- Assembling machine at (23.5, 2.5) for crafting inserters\n- Wooden chest at (20.5, 2.5) containing 36 inserters\n- Two burner inserters at (21.5, 2.5) and (25.5, 2.5)\n- Additional wooden chest at (26.5, 2.5)\n\n### Science Production\n- Assembling machine at (32.5, 5.5) for crafting logistic science packs\n- Multiple labs distributed across the map with various science pack inputs\n\n### Electrical Distribution\n- Electric pole network connecting multiple structures (currently without power)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always check and remove existing entities before placing new ones at a location\n- Use get_entities_filtered to check if a position is occupied before placing\n\n### Steam Connection Issues\n- Ensure steam pipe network has a clear path from boiler to steam engine\n- Verify the exact connection points of steam engine (input at -2.0, 14.5)\n- Remove all existing pipes before rebuilding connections to avoid conflicts\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep track of coal inventory for boiler operation\n- Mine additional coal when running low to maintain power generation\n\n### Fluid System Connectivity\n- Ensure proper orientation of fluid connection points between components\n- Verify that pipe networks form continuous connections without gaps\n- Use underground pipes when dealing with crossing paths or obstacles\n\n### Power System Setup\n- Follow the correct sequence: water pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine\n- Ensure boiler has both water input and steam output properly connected\n- Maintain fuel supply in boiler to keep steam production active"}
