{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at (-15, -50)\n- Burner mining drill at (-15, -50) connected to wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-14, -47) for smelting iron plates\n\n###Iron Smelting Array\nMultiple stone furnaces for iron plate production:\n- Furnace at (0, 0)\n- Furnace at (2, 0)\n- Furnace at (4, 4)\n- Furnace at (6, 4)\n\n###Automation Science Pack Production at (24.5, 4.5)\n- Assembling machine at (24.5, 4.5)\n- Input chest at (21.5, 4.5) containing iron plates\n- Output chest at (27.5, 4.5) containing copper plates and science packs\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - At (22.5, 4.5) moving items from input chest to assembler\n  - At (26.5, 4.5) moving items from assembler to output chest\n\n###Power Generation System\n- Steam engine at (-5.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at (-2, 23.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting these components:\n  - Water-filled pipes at (-6.5, 14.5) to (-3.5, 23.5)\n  - Empty pipe sections at various locations\n\n###Research Setup\nMultiple labs positioned across the map, all currently unpowered but configured for automation research\n\n###Electrical Infrastructure\nElectric pole network spanning from (13.5, 21.5) to (9.5, 13.5), currently not providing power\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Pipe Placement Errors\n- Check for existing pipes before placing new ones at the same location\n- Remove existing pipes if they need to be replaced\n- Ensure target location is clear of other entities before placing pipes\n\n###Underground Pipe Issues\n- Ensure you have pipe-to-ground items in inventory before attempting to place them\n- Current attempts to place underground pipes are failing due to missing inventory items\n\n###Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Verify target location is clear before placing any entity\n- Remove conflicting entities if replacement is needed\n- Check surrounding area for entity collision boxes that might prevent placement\n\n###Power System Issues\n- Steam engine and labs are not receiving power\n- Ensure complete connection between power generators and consumers\n- Verify proper fluid connections between offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine"}
