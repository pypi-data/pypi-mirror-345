{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production at position(16, 71)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position (16.0, 71.0)) \n- Stone furnace (position (16.0, 73.0))\n- Burner inserter (position (16.5, 75.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (16.5, 74.5))\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when connecting entities directly\n  - Ensure that you are not trying to connect entities directly that do not support direct connection. For example, transport belts cannot be connected directly to a furnace. Instead, use an inserter to input items into the furnace.\n* Errors when placing entities next to each other\n  - Ensure that the space next to the entity you are trying to place another entity is not occupied. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction of placement.\n* Errors when connecting entities that are not adjacent\n  - Ensure that there is a valid path between the entities you are trying to connect. Check that the entities are adjacent or that there are no obstacles in between.\n* Errors when accessing non-existent attributes of an entity\n  - Ensure that the attribute you are trying to access exists for the entity. For example, 'Furnace' object has no attribute 'drop_position'. Check the entity's documentation to see what attributes are available.\n* Errors when there is no valid path to normalize between entities\n  - Ensure that there is a valid path between entities you are trying to connect. For example, between a burner-mining-drill and a burner-inserter.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
