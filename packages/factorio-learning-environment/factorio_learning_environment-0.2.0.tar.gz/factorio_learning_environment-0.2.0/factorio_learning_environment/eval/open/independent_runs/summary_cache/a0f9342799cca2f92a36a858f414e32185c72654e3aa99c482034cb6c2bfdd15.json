{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=1.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnaces at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=2.0, y=0.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=1.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Chest Placement\n- Ensure the target tile is free of obstructions before attempting to place a chest. The agent repeatedly attempted to place chests at various positions (e.g., x=4.5 y=1.5, x=5.5 y=1.5) without success due to obstructions or incorrect placement logic.\n\n### Errors in Code Execution\n- When using the Position object, ensure correct method usage. The agent encountered a `TypeError` when attempting to call a 'Position' object.\n- Ensure all necessary modules and variables are defined before use. The agent encountered a `NameError` due to an undefined 'builtins' name.\n- Correctly define and use data types in code. The agent encountered an error related to integer type expectations in the `BuildingBox` definition.\n\n### Resource Availability\n- Regularly check and maintain resource levels to ensure continuous operation. The agent repeatedly faced issues with no iron ore available to supply to furnaces, which halted production processes."}
