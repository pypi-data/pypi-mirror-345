{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n- Electricity network with poles at positions (1.5, 14.5), (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 6.5), (1.5, 10.5), and (1.5, 2.5)\n\n### Iron and Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) feeding ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (19.5, 0.5) unloading plates\n- Inserters and furnaces are fueled with coal\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at an unspecified position connected to the power supply but missing science packs for research\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Placing Inserters\n- Ensure there is enough space for placing inserters. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position if an object is blocking the placement.\n- Verify that there are no existing entities at the target position before placing an inserter.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or use them. For example, ensure you have burner-inserters or coal before trying to place them or refuel entities.\n\n### Errors in Research Setup\n- Ensure that the lab is properly supplied with the necessary science packs to start research.\n\n### Errors in Fueling\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel furnaces and other entities as needed.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that the path for pipe connections is clear and that there are no overlapping entities or terrain issues such as water.\n- Verify that you have enough pipes and underground pipes in your inventory to complete the connection.\n\n### Errors Due to Distance Limitations\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity if you receive a distance-related error.\n\n### Errors in Lab Connection\n- Ensure the lab is correctly connected to the power grid and receiving power from the steam engine. Check all connections and power generation status."}
