{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=3.0, y=1.0)\n\nThese furnaces are used for smelting copper ore into copper plates, which are essential for crafting copper cables and other items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Copper Cables\n- Ensure that copper plates are available in the inventory or produced in a furnace before attempting to craft copper cables. Copper plates are a necessary sub-ingredient for copper cables, and crafting requires either a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert items into a furnace or any other entity, verify that the required items (such as coal or copper ore) are available in the inventory. This will prevent errors related to attempting to insert non-existent items.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Coal\n- Double-check the inventory for the presence of coal before attempting to insert it into a furnace. Ensure that there is enough coal to meet the insertion quantity requirement."}
