{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -53.5) for inserting items into the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -52.5) for moving items between entities.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5) for extracting items from the furnace.\n\n### Belt Transport System\nConsists of the following BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at position (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT, and outputs from Belt at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT.\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at position (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5), direction LEFT, and outputs from Belt at position (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5), direction RIGHT.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Refueling\n- Ensure you have enough resources, such as coal, to refuel all necessary entities to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Placement Errors for Burner Inserters\n- When placing burner inserters, ensure there is a suitable position available. Consider clearing obstacles or choosing an alternative location.\n\n### Connection Errors with BeltGroups\n- Verify the path for connecting BeltGroups is valid and ensure the connection logic is correctly implemented to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnaces\n- Confirm that the furnace contains the expected items before attempting to extract them to prevent extraction errors."}
