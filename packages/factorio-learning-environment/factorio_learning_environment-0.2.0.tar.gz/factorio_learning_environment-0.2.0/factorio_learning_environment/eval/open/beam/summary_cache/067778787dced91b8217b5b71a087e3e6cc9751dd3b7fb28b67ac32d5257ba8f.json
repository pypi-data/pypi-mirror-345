{"content": "The error indicates that the `Inventory` object does not have a `values()` method. Instead, we should iterate over the known item types and check their quantities directly. Let's adjust the code to handle this correctly:\n\n```python\n# Move to the furnace position\nmove_to(furnace_position)\n\n# Attempt to extract all items from the furnace\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\n\n# List of known item types that might be in the furnace\nitem_types = [\n    Prototype.Coal,\n    Prototype.IronOre,\n    Prototype.IronPlate,\n    Prototype.CopperOre,\n    Prototype.CopperPlate\n]\n\n# Extract all items from the furnace\nfor item_type in item_types:\n    quantity = furnace_inventory.get(item_type, 0)\n    if quantity > 0:\n        extract_item(item_type, furnace_entity.position, quantity=quantity)\n\n# Verify that the furnace is empty\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nquantities = [furnace_inventory.get(item_type, 0) for item_type in item_types]\nprint(\"Quantities after attempting to clear furnace: \", quantities)\n\n# Ensure the furnace is empty\nassert all(quantity == 0 for quantity in quantities), \"Furnace should be entirely empty now.\"\n\n# Attempt to insert coal into the furnace\navailable_coal = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\nassert available_coal > 0, \"Player's inventory lacks sufficient coal to insert; re-gather required.\"\n\ntry:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace_entity, quantity=1)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Issue on insertion detected: {str(e)} - Investigate surrounds.\")\n\n# Check the furnace inventory after attempting to insert coal\nfurnace_post_action_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(\"Furnace status after coal insertion attempt: \", furnace_post_action_inventory)\n\n# Confirm the presence of coal in the furnace\nif furnace_post_action_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) > 0:\n    print(\"Coal insertion verified successfully.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Discrepancy noted in Coal ETA for furnace; check post input functions.\")\n\n# Print final state and entities for verification\nprint(f\"Final Inventory after Coal Insertion Task: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities available post-diagnostic actions: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis code iterates over a predefined list of possible item types in the furnace, extracts them, and verifies that the furnace is empty before attempting to insert coal.
