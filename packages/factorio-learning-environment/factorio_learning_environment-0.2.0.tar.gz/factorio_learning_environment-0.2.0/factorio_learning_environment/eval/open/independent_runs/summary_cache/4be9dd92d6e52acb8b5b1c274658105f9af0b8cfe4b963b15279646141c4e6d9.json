{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) receiving coal from the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) awaiting items to transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or belt) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check for blockages or empty inventories that might prevent item transfer.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly empty chests that are used as drop-off points for mining drills to prevent production halts. For example, the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) needs to be emptied to continue iron ore mining.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to maintain production. Regularly check and refill the furnace input inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
