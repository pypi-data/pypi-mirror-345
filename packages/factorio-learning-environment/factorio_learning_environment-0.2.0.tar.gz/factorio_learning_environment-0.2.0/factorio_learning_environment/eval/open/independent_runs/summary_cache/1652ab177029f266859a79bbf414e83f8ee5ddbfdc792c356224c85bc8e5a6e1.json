{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map during these steps. Several attempts were made to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) but placement and crafting failed due to missing inventory and inadequate resources. Although existing furnaces (at positions (5.0, 5.0) and (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were referenced during resource processing, no additional structure was built or updated in these phases.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage \u2013 get_entities\n  - Use get_entities with the proper argument format. Avoid unexpected keywords (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and ensure the number and type of arguments match the API\u2019s specification.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Checks\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), verify that the inventory contains a Lab. This prevents errors related to placing an entity that is not available.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Sub-ingredient Management\n  - Ensure all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available before crafting the Lab. Validate that any list or collection used for existing Lab entities is not None to avoid iteration errors.\n  \n\u2022 Resource Supply Chain Integrity\n  - Confirm that intermediary production steps (such as sufficient smelting of iron or copper) are properly managed to meet the demands of complex crafting recipes."}
