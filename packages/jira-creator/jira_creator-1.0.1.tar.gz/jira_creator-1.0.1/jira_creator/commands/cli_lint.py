"""
This module provides a function cli_lint that performs linting on a Jira issue using an AI provider.
It makes a request to Jira to retrieve issue details, validates the fields with the AI provider, and prints lint issues
if any.
If lint issues are found, it returns the problems; otherwise, it indicates a successful lint check.
In case of a LintError exception, it prints an error message and raises the exception.

Function cli_lint:
- Fetches an issue from Jira using the provided issue key and performs linting on the issue fields.
- Arguments:
- jira: Jira client object used to interact with the Jira API.
- args: Command-line arguments containing the issue key.
- Exceptions:
- This function does not handle any exceptions explicitly. Any exceptions raised during Jira API requests will
propagate.
- Side Effects:
- Modifies the 'key' field in the retrieved Jira issue.
- Note: This function does not have a return value.
