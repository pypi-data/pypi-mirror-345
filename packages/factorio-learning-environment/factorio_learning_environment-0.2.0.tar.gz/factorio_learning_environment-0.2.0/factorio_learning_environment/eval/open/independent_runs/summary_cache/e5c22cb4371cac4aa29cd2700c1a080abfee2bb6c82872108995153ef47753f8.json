{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) with a warning that the transport belt at drop position (42.5, -83.5) is blocked.\n- Transport Belt from position (41.5, -83.5) to (46.5, -83.5) transporting coal.\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, currently holding iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, currently holding iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that the transport belt at the drop position is clear to avoid blocking the inserter's operations. Clear the belt at (42.5, -83.5) to continue mining.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the Burner Mining Drill to prevent it from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to prevent them from idling with warnings of no ingredients to smelt."}
