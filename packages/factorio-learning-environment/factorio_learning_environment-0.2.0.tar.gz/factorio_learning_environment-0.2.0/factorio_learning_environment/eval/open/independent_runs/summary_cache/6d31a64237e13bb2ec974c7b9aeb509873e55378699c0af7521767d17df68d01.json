{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the current steps. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully placed due to errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Wooden Chest Placement Errors**: The agent attempted to place a Wooden Chest at various locations (e.g., x=30.0 y=30.0, x=40.5 y=-82.5, x=50.0 y=-90.0, x=0.0 y=0.0, x=100.0 y=-150.0) but was unsuccessful. Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the chest before placing.\n  \n- **Transport Belt Placement Errors**: The agent attempted to place a Transport Belt at locations such as x=45.0 y=-85.0 and x=65.0 y=-105.0 but failed. Verify that the path is clear and the placement does not intersect with other entities or obstacles.\n\n- **Stone Furnace Placement Error**: The agent attempted to place a Stone Furnace at x=5.0 y=5.0 but was unsuccessful. Check that the placement area is clear and the furnace can be placed without obstruction.\n\nTo mitigate these errors, always ensure that the target location for placing an entity is clear of other entities and obstacles. Additionally, verify that the placement adheres to any game-specific rules or restrictions regarding entity placement."}
