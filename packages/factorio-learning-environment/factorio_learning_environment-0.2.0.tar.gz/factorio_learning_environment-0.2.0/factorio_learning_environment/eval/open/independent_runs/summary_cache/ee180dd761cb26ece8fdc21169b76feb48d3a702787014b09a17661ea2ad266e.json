{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5), boiler (position -24.5, -50.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position not specified) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine (position not specified)\n- Beltgroup (position not specified) that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine (position not specified)\n\n### Lab at position(x)\nConsists of lab (position not specified) which is currently without power.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that the pipes are properly placed and connected before attempting to connect the boiler to the steam engine. Check for any obstructions or misalignments in the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Verify that all power-consuming entities (like the lab and steam engine) are connected to a power network and have sufficient power supply."}
