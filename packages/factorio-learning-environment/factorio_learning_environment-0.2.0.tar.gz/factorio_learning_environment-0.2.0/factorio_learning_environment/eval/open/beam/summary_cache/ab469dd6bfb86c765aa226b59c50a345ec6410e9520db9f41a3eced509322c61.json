However, it has successfully produced **6 copper plates** during its operation.\n\n### Current Production Status:\n- The furnace has **46 pieces of coal** remaining in its inventory, indicating that it has sufficient fuel available.\n- The furnace shows **6 pieces of iron ore** as its source, which means it has not processed any iron ore during this last operation.\n\n### Current Inventory Status:\n- **Stone Furnaces**: 3\n- **Wood**: 16\n- **Coal**: 46 (adequate fuel available)\n- **Stone**: 5\n- **Iron Ore**: 0 (all processed)\n- **Iron Plates**: 3\n- **Copper Plates**: 6 (produced earlier)\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Investigate Furnace Status**: The furnace has fuel and iron ore but is not processing.
