{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the burner mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure that you are within 10 tiles of the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the desired location to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter setup issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Check the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly set up to facilitate item transfer.\n\n### Fuel management for entities\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the burner mining drill, inserter, and furnace to ensure continuous operation. Keep an adequate supply of coal in your inventory for refueling purposes.\n\n### Chest overflow and management\n- Monitor the inventory of storage chests to prevent overflow. Regularly extract items from the chest to free up space and maintain efficient operation of connected entities.\n\n### Furnace not receiving materials\n- Verify the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly transferring materials to the furnace. Check for any misalignment or fuel shortages that might impede the transfer process."}
