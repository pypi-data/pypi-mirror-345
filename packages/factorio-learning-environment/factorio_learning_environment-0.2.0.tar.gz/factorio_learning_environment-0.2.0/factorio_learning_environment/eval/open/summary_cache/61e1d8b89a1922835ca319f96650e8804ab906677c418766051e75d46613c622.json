{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently no power and output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates; furnace source and result inventories are full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (25.5, 80.5); the first two chests store iron plates, the third is placed near the assembling machine.\n- Burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5) and (23.5, 75.5); the first moves iron plates from furnace to chest, the second placed to the right of chest (21.5, 75.5) but currently out of fuel.\n- Small electric pole at position (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network, providing electricity near furnace.\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (25.5, 78.5) set to craft iron gear wheels but not powered and missing iron plates input.\n- Burner inserter at (23.5, 75.5) placed as input inserter for assembling machine, but out of fuel.\n- Burner inserter placement attempts near chest (21.5, 75.5) failed due to occupied tiles by existing inserter and chest.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting to iron plates, storage, and partial assembly of iron gear wheels, but suffers from power issues, inserter fuel shortages, and placement conflicts.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) currently out of fuel, connected by pipes to offshore pump.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) not connected to power network and no input liquid.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5) forming part of the power network.\n\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity but is currently non-functional due to lack of boiler fuel, steam input, and power network connection.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Multiple attempts to place small electric poles near steam engine and furnace failed because the target tiles were already occupied by existing poles or chests.\n- Attempts to place burner inserters next to chest (21.5, 75.5) failed due to existing burner inserter and wooden chest occupying the intended tiles.\n- To avoid these errors, always verify tile availability before placement, consider increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or adjusting reference positions to find free tiles.\n\n### Inserter fuel and operational issues\n- Burner inserter at (23.5, 75.5) is out of fuel, causing it to wait for source items and halting material flow.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) ran out of fuel, stopping steam production and causing steam engine to lose power.\n- Regularly insert fuel into boilers and burner inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Power network connectivity and energy attribute misuse\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) is not connected to the power network and has no input steam, preventing electricity generation.\n- Small electric poles placed near furnace and steam engine are connected to the power network, but some entities remain unpowered.\n- Avoid accessing non-existent attributes like 'energy' on ElectricityGroup objects; instead, check individual poles or power sources for energy status.\n\n### Output blockage and throughput issues\n- Electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) output is blocked due to furnace belt blockage and lack of power.\n- Furnace at (18.0, 75.0) has full source and result inventories, preventing further smelting.\n- Ensure inserters and belts downstream are operational and powered to prevent blockage and maintain throughput.\n\n### Crafting and inventory management errors\n- Attempt to place assembling-machine-1 failed due to lack of that item in inventory.\n- Crafting assembling-machine-1 failed because required iron plates cannot be crafted without a crafting machine or furnace.\n- Agent switched to assembling-machine-2 successfully but encountered missing input resources and power.\n- Maintain adequate inventory of required items before placement or crafting attempts, and ensure power and input materials are available for assembling machines.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
