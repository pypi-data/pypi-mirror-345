{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (0.5, 1.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5)\n\n### Lab at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (0, 0) which is currently not powered and requires 10 automation science packs to complete automation research.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place new poles\n- Ensure you are not providing multiple values for the 'direction' argument when placing a new pole. Review the parameters being passed to the function.\n\n### Errors when the lab is not powered\n- Make sure to connect the lab to a power source to avoid it being unpowered. Check the electricity generator for proper connections.\n\n### Errors when picking up obstructing entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to pick up is not obstructing your path or other entities. Clear the area around it if necessary.\n\n### Errors when lacking required ingredients for research\n- Ensure you have the necessary ingredients in your inventory before attempting to complete research. In this case, gather at least 10 automation science packs."}
