{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple recovery steps attempted to craft and deploy a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) \u2013 the intended structure for supplying Automation Science Packs for research \u2013 but all placement and crafting efforts failed due to inventory and resource shortages.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Errors with entity retrieval:\n  - Avoid unexpected parameters when calling get_entities. Incorrect usage such as supplying a keyword ('radius') or extra positional arguments caused TypeErrors. Confirm the function\u2019s signature before passing arguments.\n\u2022 Lab placement and inventory checks:\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab at a desired position, verify that a Lab item exists in the inventory. This prevents placement errors due to a missing laboratory.\n\u2022 Handling null query results:\n  - Check that the result from entity queries is not None before iterating over it to avoid errors like \"'NoneType' object is not iterable.\"\n\u2022 Lab crafting resource management:\n  - Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (e.g., iron-gear-wheels, copper-cables, electronic-circuits) are available and that their supply chains (such as sufficient smelting of iron and copper plates) are properly established. Addressing these shortages will help prevent repeated lab crafting failures."}
