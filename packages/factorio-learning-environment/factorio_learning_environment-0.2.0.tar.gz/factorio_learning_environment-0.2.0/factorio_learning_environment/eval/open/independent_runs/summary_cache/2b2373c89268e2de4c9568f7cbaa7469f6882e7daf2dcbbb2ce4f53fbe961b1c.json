{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5).\n- The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n- The boiler is out of fuel and has no input liquid or fluid present in connections.\n- The offshore pump is working and has water available.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Lab (position unknown) is not powered and is set to research automation.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to entity connections\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect (e.g., pipes) are within range and correctly oriented. The connection from the offshore pump to the boiler failed due to incorrect positioning or orientation.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
