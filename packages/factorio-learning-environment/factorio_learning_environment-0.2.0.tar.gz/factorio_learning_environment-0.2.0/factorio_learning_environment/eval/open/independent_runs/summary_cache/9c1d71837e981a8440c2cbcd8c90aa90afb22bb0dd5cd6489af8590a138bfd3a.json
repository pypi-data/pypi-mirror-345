{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Wooden chest (x=23.5, y=-16.5) containing 222 coal\nThe drill is operational with 6 coal as fuel\n\n###Iron Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-14.0, y=23.0) with 19 coal as fuel\n- Wooden chest (x=-14.5, y=21.5) containing 794 iron ore\nThe drill is operational and mining iron ore\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Complex (x=20-24, y=20-21)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=20.0, y=20.0) with 6 coal as fuel\n- Input wooden chest (x=20.5, y=21.5) containing 145 copper ore\n- Secondary wooden chest (x=22.5, y=21.5) containing 399 copper ore\n- Stone furnace (x=24.0, y=20.0) with 50 coal as fuel\n- Output wooden chest (x=24.5, y=17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Burner inserter (x=24.5, y=18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n- Burner inserter (x=22.5, y=20.5) moving items from input chest to furnace\n\n###Unused Furnace Group\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- (x=-11.0, y=20.0) with 23 coal as fuel\n- (x=-9.0, y=20.0) with 23 coal as fuel\nBoth furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Inserter Placement and Configuration Issues\n- Ensure inserters have both valid pickup and drop-off positions before placement\n- When placing inserters, verify they are oriented correctly to transfer items between intended entities\n- Check that inserters have a clear path without blocked outputs\n\n###Resource Management\n- Maintain adequate coal supplies in inventory before attempting to refuel or insert coal into entities\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining drills and inserters to prevent operation interruptions\n\n###Entity Status Monitoring\n- Address \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" warnings in furnaces by ensuring proper material flow\n- Resolve \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" status by ensuring output paths are clear\n- Fix \"output blocked\" warnings by ensuring proper placement of destination entities"}
