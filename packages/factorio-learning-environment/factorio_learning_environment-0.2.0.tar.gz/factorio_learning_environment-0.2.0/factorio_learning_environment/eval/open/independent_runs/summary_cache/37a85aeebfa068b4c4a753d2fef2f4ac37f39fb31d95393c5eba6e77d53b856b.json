{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Storage chest (position x=23.5, y=-16.5) containing 38 coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Storage chest (position x=-14.5, y=21.5) containing 428 iron ore\n\n### Copper Processing Complex at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill for copper ore (position x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Input storage chest (position x=20.5, y=21.5)\n- Buffer chest (position x=22.5, y=21.5) containing 337 copper ore\n- Stone furnace (position x=24.0, y=20.0)\n- Output storage chest (position x=24.5, y=17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Multiple burner inserters forming a transport chain:\n  - Inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving items from input chest to buffer\n  - Inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving items to furnace\n  - Inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving processed items to output chest\n  - Support inserters at (20.5, 22.5) and (22.5, 22.5)\n\n### Unused Furnace Setup\nTwo inactive stone furnaces at positions:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Fuel Management Issues\n- Check furnace fuel capacity before attempting to insert more coal\n- Current error shows furnace at (24.0, 20.0) has reached maximum fuel capacity (50/50)\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Ensure inserter rotation matches the intended material flow direction\n- The agent correctly identified and fixed an inserter rotation issue by changing its direction to properly feed the furnace\n\n### Resource Flow Optimization\n- Multiple inserters are in \"waiting for source items\" state\n- Ensure proper material flow by checking the entire production chain for bottlenecks"}
