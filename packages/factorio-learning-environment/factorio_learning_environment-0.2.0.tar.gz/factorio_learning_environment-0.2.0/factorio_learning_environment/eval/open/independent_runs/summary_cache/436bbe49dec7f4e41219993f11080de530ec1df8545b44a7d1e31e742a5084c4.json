{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled by coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) used for storing mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items between entities.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (-12.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (-10.0, -48.0) also fueled by coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Storage Area\nThis area is used for storing iron plates and consists of:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) containing varying amounts of iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -47.5) and (-6.5, -47.5) currently empty.\n\n### Additional Inserter Operations\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items to a chest at position (-14.5, -46.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -46.5) and (-11.5, -45.5) waiting for source items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., a furnace) has the required items available before attempting to extract. Check the inventory of the entity to confirm the presence of the items you wish to extract.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Regularly monitor and clear any blockages at inserter drop positions to maintain smooth operations. Ensure that the destination entity or belt has enough space to accommodate incoming items.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
