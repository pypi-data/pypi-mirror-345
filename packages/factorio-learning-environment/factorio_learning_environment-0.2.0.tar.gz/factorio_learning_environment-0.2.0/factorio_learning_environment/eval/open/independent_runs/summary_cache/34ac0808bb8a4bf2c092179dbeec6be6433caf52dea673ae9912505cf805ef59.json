For example, errors occurred when trying to insert coal and iron ore when the inventory was empty.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. \n\n### Repeated errors with coal and iron ore insertion\n- Check your inventory frequently to ensure you have enough resources before performing insert operations to avoid repeated errors."}
