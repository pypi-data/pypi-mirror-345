{"content": "Based on the current inventory, it seems that you do not have an offshore pump available. To proceed, you will need to craft the offshore pump using available resources. Here's how you can address this:\n\n### Steps to Craft an Offshore Pump\n\n1. **Check Required Materials**: Typically, crafting an offshore pump requires resources like iron plates and iron gear wheels. Verify that you have enough of these materials.\n\n2. **Craft Missing Components**: If you lack any components needed for the offshore pump, craft those first. For example, if you need more iron gear wheels, ensure you have enough iron plates to craft them.\n\n3. **Craft the Offshore Pump**: Once you have all the necessary components, attempt to craft the offshore pump.\n\n### Example Code to Craft an Offshore Pump\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Check if we have enough materials to craft an offshore pump\n    required_iron_plates = 2  # Example requirement\n    required_iron_gear_wheels = 1  # Example requirement\n\n    # Check current inventory for required materials\n    iron_plates = inventory.get('iron-plate', 0)\n    iron_gear_wheels = inventory.get('iron-gear-wheel', 0)\n\n    # Craft missing iron gear wheels if necessary\n    if iron_gear_wheels < required_iron_gear_wheels:\n        missing_gear_wheels = required_iron_gear_wheels - iron_gear_wheels\n        print(f\"Crafting {missing_gear_wheels} iron gear wheels...\")\n        craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, missing_gear_wheels)\n\n    # Update inventory after crafting gear wheels\n    inventory = inspect_inventory()\n\n    # Ensure we have enough iron plates\n    if iron_plates < required_iron_plates:\n        print(\"Not enough iron plates to craft an offshore pump.\")\n    else:\n        # Craft the offshore pump\n        print(\"Crafting Offshore Pump...\")\n        crafted_quantity = craft_item(Prototype.OffshorePump, 1)\n        if crafted_quantity > 0:\n            print(\"Offshore Pump crafted successfully.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Failed to craft Offshore Pump.\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error during crafting: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Place the Offshore Pump**: Once crafted, place it near a water source.\n- **Continue with Setup**: After placing the offshore pump, proceed with setting up the rest of your system (e.g., boiler, steam engine).\n\nThis approach should help you craft and place the offshore pump, allowing you to continue with your setup. If you encounter further issues, ensure that all required resources are available and correctly placed in the game environment.", "summary_range": "[1-338]"}
