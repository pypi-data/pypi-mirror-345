{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Storage and Transfer System at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) with an empty inventory.\n- Wooden chest at position (43.5, -80.5) containing 39 coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) transferring items between the two chests.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (52.0, -79.0) with 26 coal in its fuel inventory.\n- Burner inserter at position (53.5, -79.5) transferring items to the furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (54.5, -79.5) containing 336 iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (55.5, -78.5) transferring items from the chest to another chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (56.5, -78.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) out of fuel and with a full chest at its drop position.\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) with an empty inventory.\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (-12.5, -48.5) transferring items to another inserter.\n\n#### Resource Storage at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (0.5, 0.5) containing various items including coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and other items.\n- Wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) containing 162 coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) containing 325 coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, 0.5) containing coal and iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors related to fuel management\n- Ensure that burner mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate. Add coal to the fuel inventory to avoid interruptions in mining and smelting processes.\n\n#### Errors related to full chests\n- Empty chests that are full to allow mining drills to continue operation. For example, the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) is full, preventing the burner mining drill from dropping mined iron ore.\n\n#### Errors related to waiting for source items\n- Ensure that inserters have items to transfer. For example, the burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) is waiting for source items to transfer between chests.\n\n#### Errors related to no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. For example, the stone furnace at position (52.0, -79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- None assigned yet."}
