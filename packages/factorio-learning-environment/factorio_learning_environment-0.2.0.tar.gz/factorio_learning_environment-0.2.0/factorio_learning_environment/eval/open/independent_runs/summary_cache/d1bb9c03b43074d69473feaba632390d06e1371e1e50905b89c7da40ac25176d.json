Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n    - Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5)\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Position (4.5, -58.5): Inventory contains 220 iron ore\n  - Position (5.5, -60.5): Empty\n- **Iron Chests** for storage:\n  - Position (-5.5, -50.5): Inventory contains 232 iron ore and 1359 iron plates\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n    - Status: Working\n    - Inventory: 2 iron ore, 45 iron plates\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n    - Status: Working\n    - Inventory: 2 iron ore, 45 iron plates\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: Coal (11 units)\n    - Status: Working\n    - Inventory: 2 iron ore, 45 iron plates\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage\n- **Wooden Chests** for storing iron plates:\n  - Positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5): Each contains 1600 iron plates and are full\n  - Position (-7.5, -50.5): Contains 315 iron plates\n  - Position (-6.5, -50.5): Empty\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors due to Full Storage Chests**\n  - Ensure storage chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining and production halts. Consider expanding storage capacity or automating the transfer of materials to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions or important variable assignments were defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
