{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nLocated at position x=-15.0, y=-50.0, this structure is designed to mine and process iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position x=-15.0, y=-50.0: This drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position x=-14.5, y=-48.5: This chest temporarily stores the mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position x=-13.5, y=-48.5: This inserter is responsible for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is fueled by coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position x=-12.0, y=-48.0: This furnace is intended to smelt the iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled by coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates initial misalignment.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly configured to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. The furnace should be positioned to receive items directly from the inserter.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly monitor and empty the chest at position x=-14.5, y=-48.5 to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Mining Drill\n- Ensure a steady supply of coal to refuel the mining drill at position x=-15.0, y=-50.0 to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly check that the furnace has a supply of iron ore to smelt. Adjust the inserter or chest setup if the furnace is not receiving ore."}
