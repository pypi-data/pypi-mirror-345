{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a warning: \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining.\"\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) with iron ore inventory.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) waiting for source items.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the mining drill to further processing.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) waiting for source items.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the furnace to the inserter, facilitating the movement of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Operations\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into mining drills or furnaces. This will prevent errors related to insufficient resources.\n\n### Full Inventory Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full inventory.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to smelt into iron plates. This will prevent the furnace from being idle.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into an entity. Ensure that the inventory has the required items before invoking this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `mining_drill`: Represents the burner mining drill entity, used for inserting fuel.\n- `furnace`: Represents the stone furnace entity, used for smelting operations.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary tracking the current inventory of resources such as wood, coal, stone, iron ore, and iron plates."}
