{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) that processes iron ore and copper ore into iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (42.0, -83.0)) that extracts resources from the ground.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) that extracts resources from the ground.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) that stores iron ore.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (42.5, -81.5)) that stores coal.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position (42.5, -80.5)) that moves coal to the burner mining drill.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position (43.5, -81.5)) that moves coal to the wooden chest.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors related to insufficient fuel for mining drills**\n  - Ensure that burner mining drills have enough fuel (coal) to operate. Check the inventory of the drills and refill them as necessary.\n\n- **Errors when trying to craft items without required technology**\n  - Research the necessary technology (e.g., Automation) before attempting to craft items that require it.\n\n- **Errors when the stone furnace has no ingredients**\n  - Ensure that the stone furnace has the required ingredients (iron ore or copper ore) to function. Check the inventory and insert items as needed.\n\n- **Errors related to insufficient resources for crafting**\n  - Monitor the inventory for required resources (e.g., Copper Plates, Automation Science Packs) and produce more if necessary.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AssemblingMachine1, quantity=1)`: Failed due to the recipe not being unlocked yet.\n  \n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `current_inventory: dict`: {'wood': 4, 'coal': 694, 'iron-plate': 110, 'iron-gear-wheel': 8}\n  - `stone_furnace_status: EntityStatus`: EntityStatus.WORKING\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status: EntityStatus`: EntityStatus.NO_FUEL"}
