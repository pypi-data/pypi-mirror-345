{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe recipe for copper plates is currently **disabled**, which explains why the furnace is not processing the copper ore into plates. The same issue applies to the recipe for electronic circuits, which is also disabled. This situation indicates that I cannot craft either item at this time due to the disabled recipes.\n\nTo move forward, I have a few options:\n1. **Enable the recipes**: If there is a way to enable these recipes, that would allow me to proceed with crafting.\n2. **Explore other crafting options**: I can check if there are any other items I can craft with the materials I currently have.\n3. **Gather more resources**: If I can find additional resources, I may be able to unlock new crafting options or recipes.\n\nGiven that I have a limited inventory and disabled recipes, I should first check if there is a way to enable these recipes or if there are any other crafting options available with my current resources.\n\nLet's check if there are any commands or actions available to enable the recipes.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Attempt to enable the copper plate and electronic circuit recipes\nenable_recipe(Prototype.CopperPlate)\nenable_recipe(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit)\n\n# Check the status of the recipes after attempting to enable them\ncopper_plate_recipe_status = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.CopperPlate)\nelectronic_circuit_recipe_status = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit)\n\nprint(f\"Status of Copper Plate Recipe after enabling: {copper_plate_recipe_status}\")\nprint(f\"Status of Electronic Circuit Recipe after enabling: {electronic_circuit_recipe_status}\")", "summary_range": "[1-82]"}
