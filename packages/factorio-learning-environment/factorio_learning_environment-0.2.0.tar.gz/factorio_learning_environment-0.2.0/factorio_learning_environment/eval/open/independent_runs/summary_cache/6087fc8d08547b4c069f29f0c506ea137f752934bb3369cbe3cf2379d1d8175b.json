{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility at Position (-23.5, -69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of transport belts leading to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) containing copper ore.\n- BeltGroup at position (-24.5, -69.5) facilitating the transport of copper ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) feeding it.\n- BeltGroup at position (-21.5, -67.5) transporting materials to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -54.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) moving iron ore to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Resource Supply to Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces are adequately supplied with the necessary raw materials (e.g., copper ore) to maintain production. Check the supply lines and ensure that the transport belts are correctly configured to deliver resources.\n\n### Errors in Belt Configuration\n- Verify that the transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to facilitate the smooth flow of resources. Misaligned belts can lead to resource shortages at critical production points.\n\n### Inserter Configuration Errors\n- Ensure that inserters are properly positioned and configured to pick up and drop items at the correct locations. Misconfigured inserters can lead to production bottlenecks.\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Regularly check inventories of chests and furnaces to ensure that resources are being utilized efficiently and that there are no excesses or shortages that could disrupt production."}
