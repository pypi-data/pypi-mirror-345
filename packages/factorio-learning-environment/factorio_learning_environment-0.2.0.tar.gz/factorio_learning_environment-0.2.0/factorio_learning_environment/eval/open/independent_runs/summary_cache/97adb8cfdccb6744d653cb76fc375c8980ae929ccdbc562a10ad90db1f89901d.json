{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter alignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest. The pickup position must match the chest's position to function correctly.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position is correctly aligned with the furnace to ensure proper transfer of materials.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position if placement fails due to collisions or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel mining drills or inserters. Keep track of coal usage to prevent running out during critical operations."}
