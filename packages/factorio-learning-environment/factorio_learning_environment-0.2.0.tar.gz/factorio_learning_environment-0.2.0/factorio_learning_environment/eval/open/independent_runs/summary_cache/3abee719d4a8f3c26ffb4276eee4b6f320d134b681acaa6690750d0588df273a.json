{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler is responsible for heating water to produce steam, while the steam engine converts steam into electricity.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) that extracts iron ore.\n- Multiple wooden chests (positions: 46.5, -83.5; 48.5, -83.5; 5.5, -79.5; 10.5, -79.5) for storing resources.\n- Belt group (position 40.5, -84.5) that connects the burner mining drill to the stone furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Not enough pipes to connect Boiler and Steam Engine. Ensure you have sufficient pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect these entities.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Cannot place Offshore Pump as it is not in inventory. Make sure to have the Offshore Pump in your inventory before trying to place it.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
