{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) with ingredients: {'iron-plate': 80}\n- Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0) with ingredients: {'iron-plate': 92}\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=62.5, y=-53.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (x=61.0, y=-54.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=65.5, y=-52.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (x=64.0, y=-53.0)\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, facilitating the transport of materials to and from the furnaces\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with warnings of being out of fuel\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=42.5, y=-83.5), (x=43.5, y=-83.5), and (x=44.5, y=-83.5) storing coal and other resources\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) waiting for source items, connected to the mining drill and chests\n\n### Belt Path to Inserters\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt path to inserter 1: left_top=Position(x=64.5, y=-51.5) right_bottom=Position(x=65.5, y=-50.5)\n- Belt path to inserter 2: left_top=Position(x=65.5, y=-51.5) right_bottom=Position(x=66.5, y=-50.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure that the path for connecting belts is valid and can be normalized. Check the start and end positions for any obstructions or misalignments.\n- When connecting belts, verify that the intended path is clear of any existing structures or entities that might block the connection.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a clear path to source items. Check the inventory and positioning of source entities to ensure they are accessible.\n\n### Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of mining drills and ensure they are refueled promptly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `furnace_ingredients`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the ingredients in each furnace, specifically 'iron-plate'.\n- `belt_paths`: List[Tuple[Position, Position]] - Tracks the positions of belt paths to inserters."}
