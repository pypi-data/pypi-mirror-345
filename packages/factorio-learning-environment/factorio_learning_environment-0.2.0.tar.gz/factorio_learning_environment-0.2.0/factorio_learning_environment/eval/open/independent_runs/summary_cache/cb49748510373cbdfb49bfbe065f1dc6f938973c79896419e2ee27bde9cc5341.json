{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (around -28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0) for smelting\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving items from furnace to chest\n\n### Iron Mining Complex (around -10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in sequence:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0)\nConnected by transport belts and supported by:\n- Multiple wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) for ore storage\n- Burner inserters at (-6.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -56.5), (-4.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -56.5) for item movement\n\n### Iron Smelting Array (around 0, 0)\nFour parallel smelting lines, each consisting of:\n1. Input chest with iron ore at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n2. Burner inserter moving ore to furnace\n3. Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n4. Output burner inserter\n5. Output chest for iron plates at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups connecting different parts of the factory:\n- Belt system from mining area (-4.5, -57.5) to smelting input area (0.5, -4.5)\n- Additional belt networks at (-9.5, -54.5) and (-6.5, -54.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Cannot place entities where other objects already exist (wooden chest placement failed at -27.5, -59.5)\n- Ensure target location is clear before attempting to place new entities\n\n### Output Blocking Issues\n- Multiple inserters and mining drills have blocked outputs\n- Ensure proper item flow by having appropriate destination entities (chests or belts) at output positions\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Some furnaces lack fuel or ingredients\n- Ensure consistent fuel and material supply to all furnaces in production lines\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Some belt segments are showing as empty or blocked\n- Verify proper belt connectivity and ensure no gaps in transport systems"}
