{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 3.0)\n- Steam engine at position (1.5, 7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\nThe system is currently not operational as the boiler has no fuel.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (15.5, -1.5) for coal collection\n- Burner inserter at position (15.5, -2.5)\n- Transport belt at position (15.5, -3.5)\nThis structure is mining coal and storing it in the wooden chest. The burner inserter is positioned to move items from the transport belt to the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if a position is already occupied before attempting to place an entity\n- Use different coordinates or remove existing entities when encountering placement conflicts\n\n### Errors with entity connections\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to certain entities (like boilers) - use inserters as intermediaries\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly from chests - use inserters to extract from chests first\n- When connecting with inserters, ensure the drop position is not already occupied by another entity\n\n### Errors with entity placement next to existing entities\n- When using place_entity_next_to, verify the target position is free\n- Consider increasing spacing or changing direction when placing entities next to others\n\n### Boiler operation issues\n- The boiler is out of fuel and needs coal to operate\n- Create a proper fuel delivery system from the coal mining operation to the boiler\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo custom functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
