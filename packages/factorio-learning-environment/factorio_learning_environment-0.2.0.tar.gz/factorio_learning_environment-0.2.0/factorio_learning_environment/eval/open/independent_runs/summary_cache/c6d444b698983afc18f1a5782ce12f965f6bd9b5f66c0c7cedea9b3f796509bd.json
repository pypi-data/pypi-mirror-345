{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at position(0.0, 0.0)\nA line of 4 furnaces with input/output infrastructure:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Input chests at (-0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at position(-8.0, -59.0)\nThree burner mining drills mining iron ore:\n- Mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Output chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n\n### Copper/Iron Processing Setup at position(-27.0, -59.0)\nA processing line consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Input inserter at (-28.5, -58.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Middle inserter at (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Storage chest at (-24.5, -58.5)\n- Output inserter at (-24.5, -57.5)\n\n### Additional Processing Line at position(-22.0, -58.0)\nTwo furnaces with shared infrastructure:\n- Stone furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0), (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Input inserters at (-22.5, -59.5), (-20.5, -59.5)\n- Output inserter at (-22.5, -56.5)\n- Output chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to connect entities incorrectly\n- Cannot connect belts directly from a wooden chest, use an inserter instead\n- Ensure you have the required items in inventory before attempting to place entities (missing transport belt)\n\n### Entity status warnings\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - ensure fuel is supplied\n- Several furnaces have no ingredients to smelt - ensure proper input supply\n- Some inserters are waiting for source items - check input supply chain\n\n### Output blockage issues\n- Mining drill output is blocked by items on ground - ensure proper output collection setup is in place before starting operation"}
