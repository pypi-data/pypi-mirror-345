{"content": "The attempt to insert coal into the stone furnace failed because I mistakenly provided a string ('stone-furnace') instead of the actual entity reference. \n\nTo resolve this, I need to reference the stone furnace entity directly. I will retrieve the furnace entity from the map and then insert coal into it.\n\nHere\u2019s the plan:\n1. Retrieve the stone furnace entity.\n2. Insert coal into the retrieved entity.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with these steps. \n\nFirst, I will get the furnace entity from the map. Then, I will insert coal into it. \n\n```python\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace}, position=Position(x=-7.0, y=7.0))[0]  # Retrieve the furnace entity\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, target=furnace, quantity=5)  # Insert coal into the retrieved furnace entity.\n```", "summary_range": "[1-102]"}
