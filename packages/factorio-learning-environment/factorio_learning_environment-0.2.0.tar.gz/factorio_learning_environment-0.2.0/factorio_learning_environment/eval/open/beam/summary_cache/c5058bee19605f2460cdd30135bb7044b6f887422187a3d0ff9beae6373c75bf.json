{"content": "I see the core issue now. We have entities placed far from our current position (0,0), but we can only interact within a 10-tile radius. Let's move closer first:\n\n```python\n# First, let's move closer to our production setup\ncurrent_pos = Position(x=0, y=0)\ntarget_pos = Position(x=19, y=-17)  # Where our drill is\n\n# Move in steps of 10 tiles to stay within range\nmove_to(Position(x=10, y=-10))  # First step\nprint(\"Moved to intermediate position\")\n\nmove_to(Position(x=19, y=-17))  # Final position near drill\nprint(\"Moved to final position near drill\")\n\n# Now we can work with our entities\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\nprint(f\"Working with drill at: {drill.position}\")\nprint(f\"And furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Place transport belt at drill's drop position\nbelt = place_entity(\n    Prototype.TransportBelt,\n    position=drill.drop_position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed transport belt at: {belt.position}\")\n\n# Check status of our setup\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Transport belt status: {belt.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {furnace.status}\")\n```\n\nKey learnings from our attempts:\n1. We must move within 10 tiles of where we want to place entities\n2. Need to move in steps when covering larger distances\n3. Entity placement needs careful consideration of spacing and existing structures\n4. Always check drop positions and entity status after placement\n\nWould you like me to execute this revised approach?", "summary_range": "[1-2560]"}
