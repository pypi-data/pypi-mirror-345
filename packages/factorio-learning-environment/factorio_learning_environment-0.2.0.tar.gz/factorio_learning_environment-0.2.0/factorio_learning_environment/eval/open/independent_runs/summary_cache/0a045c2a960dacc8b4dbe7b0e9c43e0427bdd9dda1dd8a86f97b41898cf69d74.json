{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-12.0, -51.0) with warnings: out of fuel, chest at drop position is full.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0) with warnings: no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -49.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items, connected to the wooden chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (52.0, -82.0) with status: working.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (53.5, -80.5) connected to the burner mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (52.5, -79.5) waiting for source items, connected to the wooden chest at (53.5, -80.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (52.5, -78.5) containing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items, connected to the wooden chest at (52.5, -77.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines or other entities. For example, the attempt to insert coal into the iron ore drill failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations. The burner mining drill at (-12.0, -51.0) ran out of fuel, causing a stoppage in mining operations.\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory of chests connected to mining drills to ensure they do not become full, which can halt mining operations. The chest at (-11.5, -49.5) was full, preventing further mining.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item from the inventory into a target entity. It failed due to insufficient items in the inventory (e.g., no coal available to insert).\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_drill`: Represents the entity or operation related to the iron ore drill.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary containing the current inventory items and their quantities, such as 'iron-ore' and 'iron-plate'."}
