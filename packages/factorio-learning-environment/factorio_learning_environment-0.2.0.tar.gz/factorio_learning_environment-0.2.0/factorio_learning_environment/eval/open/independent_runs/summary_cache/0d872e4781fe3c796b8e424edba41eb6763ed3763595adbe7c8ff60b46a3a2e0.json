{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with coal and iron ore as inputs.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 1.5) containing 50 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 3.5) containing 50 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 5.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 5.5) currently empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources\n- Gather the necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, ensure you have enough wood to craft a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without unlocking the recipe\n- Research the required technology before attempting to craft items that depend on it. For example, steel processing technology must be researched to craft a steel chest.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
