{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Small electric poles (positions x=3.5, y=6.5; x=4.5, y=6.5; x=0.5, y=8.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the components\n\nThe power generation system is functioning properly. The boiler has been fueled with coal, and the steam engine is connected to the power network. The water and steam pipe groups are working correctly. The system is generating electricity for the factory.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 (position x=15.5, y=70.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 (position x=18.5, y=70.5)\n- Electric mining drill 3 (position x=21.5, y=70.5)\n- Transport belt system (from position x=18.5, y=72.5 to x=26.5, y=72.5)\n- Wooden chests for collecting ore (positions x=15.5, y=72.5; x=18.5, y=72.5; x=21.5, y=72.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=16.5, y=72.5)\n- Small electric poles (positions x=18.5, y=66.5; x=18.5, y=68.5)\n\nThe mining drills are not receiving electricity. The wooden chests are filled with iron ore - the chest at position x=15.5, y=72.5 contains 171 iron ore, while the other chests contain 154 iron ore each. The burner inserter has coal fuel but its output is blocked as there is no destination entity to accept the output.\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at position(28.0, 73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 (position x=28.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 2 (position x=30.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 3 (position x=32.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 4 (position x=34.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 5 (position x=36.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 6 (position x=38.0, y=73.0)\n\nFurnaces 1 and 2 are actively smelting iron ore into iron plates, while the others are waiting for ingredients. All furnaces have coal fuel. The furnaces have accumulated iron plates (12, 12, 23, 27, 26, and 26 respectively).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at position(-55.5, 79.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 (position x=-55.5, y=79.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 (position x=-52.5, y=79.5)\n- Electric mining drill 3 (position x=-49.5, y=79.5)\n- Transport belt system (from position x=-55.5, y=81.5 to x=-53.5, y=81.5)\n- Transport belt system (from position x=-49.5, y=81.5 to x=-44.5, y=81.5)\n- Wooden chests for collecting ore (positions x=-52.5, y=81.5; x=-49.5, y=81.5)\n- Small electric poles (positions x=-52.5, y=75.5; x=-52.5, y=77.5; x=-47.5, y=77.5)\n\nThe mining drills are not receiving electricity and are limited by full chests. The wooden chests each contain 154 copper ore. The transport belts contain some copper ore in transit.\n\n### Copper Smelting at position(-45.0, 80.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=-45"}
