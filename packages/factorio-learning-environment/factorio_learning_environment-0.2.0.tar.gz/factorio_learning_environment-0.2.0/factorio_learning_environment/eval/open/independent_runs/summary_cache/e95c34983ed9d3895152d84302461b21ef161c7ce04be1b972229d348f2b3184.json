{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -21.5, 28.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is currently not connected and has warnings indicating no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place pipes. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes overlapping water\n- Ensure that the target position for placing pipes is not overlapping with water. Look for alternative locations that are clear of water.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes at occupied positions\n- Remove any existing entities at the target position before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place a pipe without having any in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. Check your inventory for the necessary components before executing placement actions.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes at a location with an existing object\n- Ensure that the target position for placing pipes is clear of any existing objects. Check the surroundings before placing pipes to avoid obstruction issues.\n\n### Errors related to obstructions near the boiler\n- Inspect the area around the boiler for any obstructions before attempting to connect or remove entities. Ensure that the path is clear to avoid connection issues.\n\n### Errors when connecting the boiler to the offshore pump\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions in the path between the boiler and offshore pump before attempting to connect them. Check for existing pipe groups or other entities that may block the connection.\n- The connection attempt failed despite removing several obstructions. Verify if there are any remaining hidden obstructions or if the connection distance exceeds limits.\n- The boiler remains not connected after multiple attempts to connect it to the offshore pump. Ensure that the connection points are accessible and that there are no remaining issues preventing the connection.\n- The boiler status indicates it is not connected, and repeated attempts to connect to the offshore pump have failed. Confirm that the necessary connections are feasible and that no new obstructions have appeared."}
