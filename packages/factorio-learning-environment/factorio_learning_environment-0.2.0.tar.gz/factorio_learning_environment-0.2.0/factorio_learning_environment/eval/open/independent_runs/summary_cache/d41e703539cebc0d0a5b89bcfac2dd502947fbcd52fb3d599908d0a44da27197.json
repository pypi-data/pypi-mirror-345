{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** (position: (-15.0, -50.0)): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently contains 10 iron ore and 11 iron plates. Fueled by coal.\n\n#### Burner Mining Drill at position (-18.0, -52.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** (position: (-18.0, -52.0)): Used for mining iron ore. Currently fueled by coal and waiting for space in the destination. Output is blocked at position (-18.5, -53.5).\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, placing a stone furnace requires 5 stone, and placing a burner mining drill requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and a stone furnace.\n\n#### Errors when smelting due to insufficient fuel or inputs\n- Always ensure the furnace has enough fuel (coal) and input materials (iron ore) before starting the smelting process. If smelting times out, check the furnace's fuel and input inventory.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items without a crafting machine\n- Some items, like iron plates and iron gear wheels, require a crafting machine or furnace to be crafted. Ensure you have the necessary infrastructure (e.g., a furnace) before attempting to craft these items.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Ensure the entities you are connecting (e.g., burner mining drill and furnace) are properly placed and have valid tile dimensions before attempting to connect them with transport belts. Verify the positions and orientations of the entities.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has completed smelting and contains the desired items before attempting to extract them. If the furnace is still working, wait for the process to complete.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is not already occupied by another entity. Check the map for existing structures or entities that might block placement."}
