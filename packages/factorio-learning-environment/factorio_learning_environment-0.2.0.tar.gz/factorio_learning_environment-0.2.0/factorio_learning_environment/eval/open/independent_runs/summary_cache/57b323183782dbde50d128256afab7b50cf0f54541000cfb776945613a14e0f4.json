The pickup position should match the chest's position exactly.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fuel Management\n- Regularly check the fuel status of inserters to ensure they are not out of fuel. Refuel them as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Verify the setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring items from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment or incorrect setup can prevent the furnace from receiving necessary resources.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel mining drills or inserters. Running out of coal can halt operations."}
