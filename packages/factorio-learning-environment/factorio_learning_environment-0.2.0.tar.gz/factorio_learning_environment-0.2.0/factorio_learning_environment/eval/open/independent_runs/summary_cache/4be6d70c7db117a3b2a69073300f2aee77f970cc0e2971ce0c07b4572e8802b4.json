{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at (15.5, 70.5) - UPDATED\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) producing 42 iron ore per minute (currently inactive due to power loss)\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 72.5) now empty after multiple rebuild attempts\n- Stone furnace at (16.0, 74.0) with 20 coal fuel but no ingredients\n- Small electric pole at (13.5, 70.5) disconnected from power network\n- Current configuration shows persistent alignment issues (1.58 tile gap between chest and furnace)\n\n### Power generation setup at (-9.5, -0.5) - DEGRADED\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) operational (100 water)\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 3.5) out of fuel (critical failure)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5, 3.5) disconnected with warnings:\n  - No input liquid\n  - Not connected to power network\n- Pipe network intact but non-functional (water 15\u00b0C)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical power system failures (NEW)\n- Boiler completely out of fuel (3 failed refuel attempts)\n- Steam engine disconnected from power network (2 occurrences)\n- Electric mining drill inactive due to power loss (persistent)\n\n### Furnace-chest alignment issues (persistent)\n- 1.58 tile gap between chest (15.5,72.5) and furnace (16.0,74.0) prevents item transfer\n- Verify adjacency requirements (maximum 1.0 tile gap allowed)\n\n### Entity placement collisions (recurring)\n- Failed inserter placement at (15.5,73.0) due to existing object (4 similar occurrences)\n- Always scan target area before placement (5 missed verifications)\n\n### Fuel management errors\n- Attempted boiler refuel with empty coal inventory (2 occurrences)\n- Maintain minimum coal reserves (recommended: 50 units)\n\n### Production diagnostics\n- Chest contents fluctuating (94 \u2192 42 \u2192 93 \u2192 0) indicates unstable system\n- Throughput monitoring shows complete production halt\n\n### Configuration protocol\n- Verify power connections after placement (3 missed checks)\n- Test fuel insertion separately from production setup (not implemented)\n- Confirm entity persistence after rebuilds (2 failed verifications)\n\n### New Critical Issues\n- Complete power grid collapse affecting all operations\n- Mining drill blocked by full chest warning despite empty chest\n- Boiler warnings not being addressed promptly"}
