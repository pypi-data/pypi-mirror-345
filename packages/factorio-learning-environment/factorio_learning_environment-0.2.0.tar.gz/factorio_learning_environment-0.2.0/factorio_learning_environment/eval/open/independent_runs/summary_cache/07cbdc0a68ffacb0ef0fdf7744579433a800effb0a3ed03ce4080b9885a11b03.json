Regularly check the inventory of connected entities to prevent downtime.\n\n#### Furnace Belt at Drop Position is Blocked\n- Ensure that the drop positions for inserters are clear and have space for items to be placed. Regularly clear out or manage inventory in connected chests.\n\n#### Refueling\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Consider automating the refueling process to improve efficiency.\n\n#### Planning for Expansion\n- Consider planning for future expansion utilizing accumulated resources. Efficiently manage resources to prevent bottlenecks and ensure smooth operation."}
