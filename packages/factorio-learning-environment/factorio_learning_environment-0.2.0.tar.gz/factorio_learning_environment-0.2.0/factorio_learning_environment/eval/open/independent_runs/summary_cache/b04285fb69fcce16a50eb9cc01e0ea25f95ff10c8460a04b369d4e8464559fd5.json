{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=81591) from offshore pump at (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to boiler\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=81580) intended to connect boiler to steam engine, but currently not connected\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=81591) transporting water from offshore pump to boiler\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=81580) intended to connect boiler to steam engine, but currently empty\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=208607) with poles at various positions, providing power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities with Pipes\n- Ensure that all entities intended to be connected by pipes are correctly aligned and within reach of each other. Verify that the pipe network is complete and that there are no missing connections between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to ensure continuous operation. Refuel as necessary to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Verify that fluid systems are correctly configured and that all necessary connections are made to allow fluid flow. Ensure that all fluid boxes are properly filled and that there are no blockages in the pipe network.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended structure."}
