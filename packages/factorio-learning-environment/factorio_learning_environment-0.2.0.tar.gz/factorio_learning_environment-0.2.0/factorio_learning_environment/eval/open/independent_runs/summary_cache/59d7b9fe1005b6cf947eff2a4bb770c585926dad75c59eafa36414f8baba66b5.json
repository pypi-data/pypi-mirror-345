{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with coal as fuel, currently producing copper plates. The furnace has a full result inventory of 100 copper plates and is experiencing a status of \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients**: \n  - Ensure that the required ingredients for crafting are available in the inventory or can be produced by existing structures. In this case, copper plates are needed to craft the automation science pack, but the furnace is not currently producing any due to a lack of input materials.\n  \n- **Errors when transferring items to a chest with insufficient inventory**: \n  - Check the inventory of the chest before attempting to transfer items. The log indicates that there were no copper plates available to transfer to the chest, which may suggest that the transfer logic is not accounting for the chest's current inventory.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**:\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to insufficient ingredients (copper plates) being available for crafting.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary containing items in the player's inventory, type: `dict`\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Inventory of the furnace, type: `Inventory`\n  - `chest_inventory`: Inventory of the wooden chest, type: `Inventory`"}
