{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production at (1,1) and (3,1)\nTwo stone furnaces have been placed and are actively smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n- Stone furnace at position (1,1) containing 23 coal as fuel and 20 iron plates as output\n- Stone furnace at position (3,1) containing 23 coal as fuel and 20 iron plates as output\nBoth furnaces currently have no ingredients to smelt\n\n###Iron Ore Mining at (-15,-54)\nA burner mining drill has been placed to mine iron ore:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15,-54) facing downward\n- Contains 24 coal as fuel\n- Mining from an iron ore patch containing 39998 ore\n- Drop-off position at (-14.5,-52.5)\n- Currently waiting for space in destination as output is blocked\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Error when trying to craft items requiring assembly or smelting\n- Items like iron plates and iron gear wheels cannot be directly crafted in inventory\n- These items require either a furnace (for smelting ore into plates) or an assembling machine (for crafting intermediate products like iron gear wheels)\n- Ensure you have the appropriate production structure (furnace/assembling machine) before attempting to craft these items\n\n### Error when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Check if you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it\n- Craft the required entity first if it's not available in inventory\n\n### Error when inserting fuel into entities\n- Ensure you have the required fuel type (coal) in your inventory before attempting to insert it into machines\n- Collect coal first before trying to fuel burner mining drills or furnaces\n\n### Error when trying to craft items requiring raw resources\n- Some items like wooden chests require raw resources (wood) that cannot be crafted\n- Raw resources must be gathered from the environment first\n- Ensure you have gathered the necessary raw resources before attempting to craft items that require them\n\n### Error with blocked mining drill output\n- Mining drills need a destination entity (like a chest) to store their output\n- When placing a mining drill, ensure you also place a storage entity at its drop-off position\n- Clear any items blocking the drop-off position before placing storage entities"}
