{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to another chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates, currently lacking ingredients.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Multiple wooden chests at various positions storing different resources, such as iron ore, copper ore, iron plates, and coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Error when Retrieving Non-Existent Entity\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. This can be done by checking the map for the presence of the entity type at the given coordinates.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly check the ingredient supply for furnaces to ensure they have the necessary materials to operate. Consider setting up automated systems to keep furnaces supplied.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters are not empty and are providing the required items. This may involve checking the inventory of source chests or ensuring that the production chain is not disrupted.\n\n### Errors with Empty Chests\n- Verify that the chests intended to store resources are being supplied correctly and are not left empty if they are part of an active production chain."}
