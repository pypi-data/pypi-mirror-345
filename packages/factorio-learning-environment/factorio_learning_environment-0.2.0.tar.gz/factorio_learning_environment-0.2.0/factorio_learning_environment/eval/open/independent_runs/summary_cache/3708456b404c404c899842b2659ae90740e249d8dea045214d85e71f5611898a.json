{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Function: Extracts iron ore from the ground.\n  - Status: Working, but chest at drop position is full. Requires emptying to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Function: Stores extracted iron ore.\n  - Current Inventory: Contains 5 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - Status: Working, but has warnings of being out of fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Function: Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is properly aligned and positioned to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check and adjust the inserter setup to maintain a continuous flow of materials.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel all entities that require fuel, such as the burner mining drill and burner inserter, to prevent interruptions in operation. Keep an adequate supply of coal in the inventory for refueling purposes.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Monitor the inventory of the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining operation. Regularly extract materials from the chest to free up space and maintain operational efficiency.\n\n### Errors with Resource Supply to Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace receives a continuous supply of iron ore by maintaining the proper functioning of the inserter and managing the chest inventory effectively."}
