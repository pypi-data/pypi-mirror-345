{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) for transferring iron ore.\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Storage Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for holding iron ore before it is transferred to the furnace.\n- **Storage Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron plates produced by Furnace 1.\n- **Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items, possibly for further processing or transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### UnboundLocalError: Accessing Uninitialized Local Variables\n- Ensure that all local variables are properly initialized before use. This error indicates that a variable is being accessed before it has been assigned a value. Double-check the logic to make sure all variables are initialized appropriately.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) has a steady supply of source items to transfer. Check the upstream processes to ensure that items are being produced and delivered to the inserter in a timely manner.\n\n### No Iron Ore Available for Transfer\n- Regularly monitor the supply of iron ore in the ore chest and ensure that there is a consistent flow of resources to avoid interruptions in the production process. Consider increasing the number of mining drills or optimizing the logistics to maintain a steady supply."}
