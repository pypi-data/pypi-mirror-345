This structure enabled a substantial increase in the overall iron-plate count.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at position (-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace located at (-27.0, -60.0) used for converting copper ore (with coal) into copper plates. This facility was critical for addressing the copper resource shortage needed for downstream recipes.\n\n(Note: Multiple attempts to craft or place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) were made but none succeeded; therefore no Lab structure is present on the map.)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n- API Usage Errors:\n  - When calling get_entities, avoid unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. 'radius') and ensure that the function is invoked with the correct number and type of arguments. Check the API\u2019s signature beforehand.\n\n- Inventory and Placement Issues:\n  - Verify that the required entity (e.g. a Lab) is available in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map. Ensure sufficient resource and inventory checks are performed prior to placement actions.\n\n- Crafting Dependency Difficulties:\n  - Confirm that all prerequisite sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper cables) are available or producible before attempting to craft complex items like the Lab.\n  - Establish and verify the production pipelines for intermediate products to prevent recurring failures in complex crafting recipes.\n\n- Data Handling and Fallback Checks:\n  - When processing the output from functions (such as filtering lab entities), guard against None values by implementing proper type checks or fallbacks to avoid \u2018NoneType\u2019 not iterable errors.\n\n(NAMESPACE section omitted as no custom functions have been defined by the agent.)"}
