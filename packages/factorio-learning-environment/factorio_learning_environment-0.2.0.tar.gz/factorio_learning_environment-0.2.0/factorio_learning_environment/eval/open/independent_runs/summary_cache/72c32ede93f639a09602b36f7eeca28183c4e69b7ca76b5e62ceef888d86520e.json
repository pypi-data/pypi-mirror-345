For example, extracting iron plates from a position without a valid entity containing them will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and clear chests that are full to prevent mining and inserter operations from being blocked."}
