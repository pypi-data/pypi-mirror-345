{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore and process it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that inserters are properly aligned with both the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in all entities that require it, such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Ensure that there is enough coal in inventory to refuel these entities as needed.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Monitor the storage capacity of chests and other storage entities. Ensure they are not full to avoid halting production processes. Empty chests regularly to maintain workflow efficiency.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Verify that furnaces have both fuel and raw materials (iron ore) to function correctly. Lack of either will result in no production of iron plates."}
