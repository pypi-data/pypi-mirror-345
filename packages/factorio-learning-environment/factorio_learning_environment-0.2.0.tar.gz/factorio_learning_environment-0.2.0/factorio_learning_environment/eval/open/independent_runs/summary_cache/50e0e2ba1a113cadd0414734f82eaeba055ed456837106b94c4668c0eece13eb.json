This structure was utilized in step 1821 to smelt 10 iron ore and 10 coal into 30 extra iron plates.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nUsed for converting copper ore into copper plates. In step 1822, this furnace processed 50 copper ore (with coal) into 45 copper plates.\n\nNo Lab or other production structures have been successfully placed on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Errors with get_entities\n  - Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. remove \u2018radius\u2019) and adjust positional arguments to match the function\u2019s expected signature.\n  \n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Issues\n  - Verify that an item (such as a Lab) is present in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n  \n\u2022 Data Handling Oversight\n  - Check that returns from functions like get_entities are not None before iterating over them; use a fallback (e.g. an empty list) if necessary.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting Dependency Failures for Lab Production\n  - Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available. Validate that prerequisite production steps (e.g. smelting of iron-plates or copper-plates) have been successfully completed prior to initiating Lab crafting."}
