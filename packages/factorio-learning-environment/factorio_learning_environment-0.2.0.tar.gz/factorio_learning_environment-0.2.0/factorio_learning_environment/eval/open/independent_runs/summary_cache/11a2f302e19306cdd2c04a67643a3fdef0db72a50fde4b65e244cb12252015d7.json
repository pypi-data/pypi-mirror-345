{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5) \n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that there are no obstructing pipes or entities in the way when attempting to connect the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine. Check for placement blockages and remove any obstructing entities before reconnecting.\n\n### Errors when using electricity\n- Ensure that all electric entities are properly plugged into the electric network. Check the status of electric poles and ensure they are connected to the power grid.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may block placement."}
