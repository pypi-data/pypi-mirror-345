{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with an inventory containing 100 copper plates. The furnace is currently out of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Factory\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position (0, 0)) for smelting copper plates.\n- Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) for storing copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients**\n  - Ensure that the required ingredients for crafting are available in the inventory or in the connected furnaces. In this case, copper plates are required for crafting automation science packs, but the furnace is not producing them due to lack of ingredients.\n  \n- **Errors when transferring items to the chest**\n  - Confirm that there are items available in the inventory to transfer to the chest. The logs indicate attempts to transfer copper plates when none are available.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to missing copper plates, which are required for crafting.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `copper_plate: int` - Amount of copper plates available.\n  - `chest_inventory: dict` - Inventory of the chest containing copper plates.\n  - `furnace_inventory: dict` - Inventory of the furnace containing copper plates.\n  - `current_inventory: dict` - Player's current inventory containing various items."}
