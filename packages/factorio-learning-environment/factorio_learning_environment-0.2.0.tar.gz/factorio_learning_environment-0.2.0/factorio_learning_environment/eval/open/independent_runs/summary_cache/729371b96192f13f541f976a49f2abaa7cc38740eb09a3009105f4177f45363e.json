Verify that calls exactly match the expected signature and validate the return value before iterating, using an empty list fallback if needed.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Verification \u2013 Multiple attempts to place a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5) failed because no Lab was available in inventory. Confirm resource availability before invoking placement actions.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Prerequisite Shortfalls \u2013 Lab crafting errors arose from missing sub-ingredients (for example, shortages in iron\u2010gear\u2010wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables). Check that all cascading production requirements for a lab are met (including availability of base ingredients such as iron-plate and copper-plate) to avoid repetitive crafting failures."}
