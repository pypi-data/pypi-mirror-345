{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone mine at position(-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-45.5, y=1.5)\n\n#### Stone brick factory at position(-45.0, 3.0)\nConsists of \n- Stone furnace (position x=-45.0, y=3.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=1.5) that moves stone from the chest at position(-45.5, 1.5) to the furnace\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=4.5) that moves stone bricks from the furnace to the chest at position(-44.5, 5.5)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-44.5, y=5.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Ensure that you are not trying to connect entities directly that are not meant to be connected directly (e.g., trying to connect a chest directly to another entity without using an inserter).\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into an entity\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n\n#### Errors when retrieving entities at a specific position\n- Verify that an entity of the expected type exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n#### Common error patterns\n- The agent made multiple errors related to incorrect usage of API functions (e.g., trying to connect a chest directly to another entity, attempting to insert items without having them in the inventory, and trying to retrieve non-existent entities). To avoid these errors, ensure that you understand the correct usage of the API functions and verify the preconditions before calling them.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
