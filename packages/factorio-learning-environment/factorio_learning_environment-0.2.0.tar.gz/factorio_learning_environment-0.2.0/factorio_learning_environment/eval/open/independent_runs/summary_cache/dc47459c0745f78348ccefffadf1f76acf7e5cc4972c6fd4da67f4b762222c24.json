{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (35.5, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (35.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 26.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Pipes connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler and Boiler to Steam Engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserters facilitating movement of materials between furnaces and chests\n- Wooden Chests for storage at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple Pipe Groups facilitating fluid transport across the map, with key positions at (0.5, 11.5), (5.5, 18.5), (18.5, 21.5), (22.5, 20.5), and others.\n\n### Power Network\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various structures, with key positions at (33.5, 24.5), (1.5, 10.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting and Inventory Management\n- Ensure all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft items like small electric poles.\n- Verify that copper plates are available in a furnace or crafting machine for crafting copper cables.\n\n### Errors in Connecting and Placing Entities\n- Make sure to have the required items in the inventory before attempting to connect entities like steam engines to the power network.\n- Ensure there are no existing objects in the way before placing entities like boilers and pipes.\n- Move closer to the target position when placing pipes or other entities, as placement is limited by a maximum distance.\n\n### Errors with Entity Functionality\n- Investigate and resolve issues with offshore pumps and steam engines not working. Check connections and ensure all components are correctly placed and powered.\n- Verify that boilers are correctly placed and fueled to produce steam.\n\n### Errors with API Usage\n- Ensure correct usage of API functions when retrieving entities by verifying the position and type of the entity.\n- Address any exceptions related to incorrect data types or missing entities in the specified positions."}
