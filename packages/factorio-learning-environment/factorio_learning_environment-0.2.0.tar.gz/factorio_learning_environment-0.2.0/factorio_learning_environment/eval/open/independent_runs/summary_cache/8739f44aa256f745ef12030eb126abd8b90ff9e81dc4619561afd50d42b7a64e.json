{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position(-21.5, 28.0)\n- Pipe connections between the boiler and offshore pump, with a blockage preventing successful connection.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position(5.0, 5.0) and a furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position(y1) to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electricity connections\n- Ensure that all entities are properly plugged into the electric network before attempting to connect them. Check for any obstructions or unconnected entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- When attempting to connect pipes, ensure there are no placement blockages. Move the entities closer together if necessary or clear any obstructing entities.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities that may block placement."}
