{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is free of other entities or obstacles before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for items on the ground that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Verify that the target location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity. Ensure that the entity type is compatible with the target tile.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity type matches the expected type.\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output from drills or other production entities to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients\n- Maintain a steady supply of necessary ingredients to production entities like furnaces to avoid production halts. Check inventory levels regularly and automate supply chains where possible."}
