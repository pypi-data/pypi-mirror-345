{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-5.5, y=2.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=2.0) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=5.5) generating power\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Burner inserter (x=-5.5, y=4.5) for loading coal into boiler\n- Small electric pole (x=1.5, y=5.5) connecting to power network\n- The boiler is currently out of fuel and not working\n\n### Coal Mining Operation #1 (x=16.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=16.0, y=0.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden chest (x=15.5, y=-1.5) storing coal (62 coal)\n- Burner inserter (x=16.5, y=-1.5) moving coal from drill to chest\n- Transport belt (x=15.5, y=-2.5)\n- Burner inserter (x=15.5, y=-3.5) taking coal from chest to belt\n\n### Coal Mining Operation #2 (x=16.0, y=4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=16.0, y=4.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden chest (x=15.5, y=2.5) storing coal (12 coal)\n- Burner inserter (x=16.5, y=2.5) moving coal from drill to chest\n- The inserter is blocked as there is no output destination\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation (x=15.5, y=70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=15.5, y=70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest (x=15.5, y=68.5) for storing iron ore\n- Burner inserter (x=16.5, y=68.5) moving ore from chest to belt\n- Transport belt system connecting to furnace\n- Stone furnace (x=21.0, y=71.0) smelting iron ore into plates\n- Burner inserter (x=19.5, y=71.5) feeding ore into furnace\n- Wooden chest (x=21.5, y=72.5) for storing iron plates\n- Small electric pole (x=13.5, y=69.5) providing power\n- The furnace is working and has 11 iron plates in its output\n\n### Copper Mining Operation (x=-46.5, y=70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=-46.5, y=70.5) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden chest (x=-46.5, y=68.5) storing copper ore (29 copper ore)\n- Small electric pole (x=-44.5, y=68.5) providing power\n- The mining drill is not receiving electricity\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with transport belt connections\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to chests or boilers - always use inserters as intermediaries\n- When connecting entities with transport belts, ensure both source and target can interface with belts\n- For chests: Place an inserter to take items from the chest and drop onto the belt\n- For boilers: Place an inserter to take items from the belt and insert into the boiler\n- Transport belts cannot connect entities that are far apart (like from x=15.5 to x=-5.5)\n- For long distances, build a continuous belt path between source and destination\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Check for collisions before placing entities - existing entities (like mining drills) can block placement\n- When placing entities next to others, be aware of spacing and direction parameters\n- Pipes and other infrastructure can block inserter placement - try different directions or increase spacing\n- For tight spaces, consider the size of entities (mining drills are 2x2, boilers are 2x3, etc.)\n- When placing an inserter near a chest or furnace, ensure there is enough space and no collision with existing entities\n- Check if an entity already exists at the target position before attempting to place a new one\n\n###"}
