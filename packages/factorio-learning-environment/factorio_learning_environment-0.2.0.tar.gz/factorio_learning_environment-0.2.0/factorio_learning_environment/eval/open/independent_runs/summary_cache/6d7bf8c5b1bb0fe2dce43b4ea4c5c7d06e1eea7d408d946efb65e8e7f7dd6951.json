{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). The drill is currently working but has a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, -58.5), (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (9.5, -60.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). The furnace at (-15.0, -48.0) is full with iron plates, the furnace at (-13.0, -48.0) is working, and the furnace at (-11.0, -48.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Ensure that the chests used for collecting mined resources have enough space to accommodate the output from the mining drills. Regularly empty the chests to prevent overflow and halt in mining operations.\n\n### Furnace Output Overflow\n- Regularly remove the smelted items from the furnace output to prevent the furnace from stopping due to a full output inventory.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Shortage\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of ingredients to maintain continuous operation. Check and refill the furnace source inventory to avoid idle time.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the given execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_extracted`: int - Tracks the amount of iron ore extracted from the chest.\n- `iron_ore_inserted`: int - Tracks the amount of iron ore inserted into the furnaces.\n- `furnace_positions`: list of tuples - Stores the positions of the furnaces used for smelting.\n- `chest_positions`: list of tuples - Stores the positions of chests used in the mining operation."}
