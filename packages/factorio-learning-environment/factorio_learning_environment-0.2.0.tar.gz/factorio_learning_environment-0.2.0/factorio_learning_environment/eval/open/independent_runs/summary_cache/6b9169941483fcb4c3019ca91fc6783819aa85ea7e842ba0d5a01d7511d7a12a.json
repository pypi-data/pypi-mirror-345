{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-16.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal and iron ore inserted, currently producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with coal and iron ore inserted, currently producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace at (-14.0, -49.0) to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates transferred by the burner inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Confirm the tile is not occupied or restricted for the entity type.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Iron Plates\n- Iron plates cannot be crafted directly in the inventory. They require smelting in a furnace. Ensure you have a furnace set up for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Validation Errors for BuildingBox\n- Ensure that dimensions for entities like furnaces are valid integers. Check the configuration or input parameters to avoid validation errors.\n\n### Errors in Resource Insertion\n- Ensure that you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces."}
