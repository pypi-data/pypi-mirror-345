Its fluid box contains water (amount \u2248190.1, temperature 15) with connection points at (-5.5, 22.5) and (-5.5, 26.5); now assigned fluid_system [154923] with steam output at (-7.5, 24.5).\n- Offshore Pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) for water intake; status WORKING; its fluid box contains water and it uses fluid_system [154923].\n- Wooden chest at position(-4.5, 25.5) serving as the manual fuel feeding system.\n- Pipeline Network consisting of:\n  - PipeGroup at position(-5.5, 19.5) with fluid_system=154923, status WORKING.\n  - PipeGroup at position(-2.5, 19.5) with fluid_system=154922, status EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position(5.5, 21.5) with fluid_system=154935, status EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position(1.5, 23.5) with fluid_system=154934, status EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position(-7.5, 25.5) with fluid_system=154930, status EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position(0.5, 24.5) with fluid_system=154939, status EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position(1.5, 25.5) with fluid_system=154938, status EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position(1.5, 27.5) with fluid_system=154941, status EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position(4.5, 27.5) with fluid_system=154942, status EMPTY.\n  - PipeGroup at position(-0.5, 28.5) with fluid_system=154943, status EMPTY.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Repeated pipe connection failures with mismatched fluid_system identifiers:\n  - Multiple connection attempts using candidate pipe groups with fluid_system values 154259, 154343, 154425, 154509, 154591, 154675, 154757, and 154841 near position (-5.5, 19.5) have all failed.\n  - Tip: Confirm and use the correct, unified fluid_system assignment\u2014in this case, the final correct system is 154923\u2014for the boiler, offshore pump, and associated pipeline to avoid redundant connection attempts.\n\n\u2022 Inconsistent fluid_system sourcing:\n  - Varying fluid_system values derived from differing sources (boiler\u2019s initially assigned value versus values reported from final entities) led to repeated unsuccessful searches for candidate pipe groups.\n  - Tip: Consolidate fluid_system data from the boiler\u2019s configuration and final entity reports to ensure consistency during connection attempts.\n\n\u2022 Lack of pre-validation for connection candidates:\n  - Searches performed within a 15-tile radius near (-5.5, 19.5) consistently returned 0 candidate pipe groups, causing aborts at every attempt.\n  - Tip: Implement a pre-validation check for candidate availability before initiating connection operations to streamline the process."}
