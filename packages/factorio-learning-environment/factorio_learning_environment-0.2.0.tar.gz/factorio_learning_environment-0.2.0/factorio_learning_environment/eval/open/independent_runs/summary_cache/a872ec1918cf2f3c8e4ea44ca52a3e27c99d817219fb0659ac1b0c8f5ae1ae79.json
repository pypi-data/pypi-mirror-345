{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with fuel inventory of coal and status as WORKING. It is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) with fuel inventory of coal. Both have a status of NO_INGREDIENTS, indicating they are waiting for iron ore to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) which are responsible for transferring smelted iron plates to storage chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions (e.g., x=-6.5, y=-49.5; x=-4.5, y=-48.5; x=-3.5, y=-48.5) used for storing iron plates, some of which have reached full capacity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Ensure that storage chests have enough capacity before attempting to insert items. Monitor chest inventory levels and transfer items to prevent overflow.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to transfer. Ensure continuous supply of resources to avoid idle inserters.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Supply\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel for burner mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of coal to avoid interruptions in mining and smelting processes.\n\n### Errors with Resource Availability\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients (iron ore) to avoid idle time. Monitor resource levels in chests and adjust inserter configurations as necessary to maintain flow."}
