{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes and pipe groups at various positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-6.5, 23.5), (-5.5, 23.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with burner inserters for automation\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with burner inserters for automation\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with burner inserters for automation\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with burner inserters for automation\n\n### Science Lab at Position (unknown)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs\n- Connected to the electricity network but currently has no power\n\n### Pipe and Electricity Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, including fluid systems and electricity poles at positions such as (1.5, 14.5), (3.5, 20.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes into occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target position is clear of any existing entities before attempting to place pipes. Remove any obstructing pipes or entities first.\n\n### Errors with inventory management\n- Verify the availability of required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities, such as automation science packs or coal.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Confirm that the target entity contains the items you intend to extract. Ensure the entity is not empty or lacks the specified item.\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Make sure all power-generating entities are properly connected to the power network to avoid status issues like \"not connected to power network\" or \"no input liquid.\""}
