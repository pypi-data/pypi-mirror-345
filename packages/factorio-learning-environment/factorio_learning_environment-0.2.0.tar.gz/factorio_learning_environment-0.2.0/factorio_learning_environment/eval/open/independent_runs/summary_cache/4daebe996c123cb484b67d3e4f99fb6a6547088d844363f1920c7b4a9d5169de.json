Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Verify that the source and target entities are correctly positioned and that the belt path is unobstructed. Ensure the inserter is facing the correct direction.\n\n#### Errors when removing entities\n- Before removing an entity, ensure it is not being referenced by other entities or systems. For example, removing a chest while an inserter is still trying to transfer items to it will cause errors.\n\n#### Errors when inserting fuel into inserters\n- Ensure the inserter has a valid fuel source and is correctly positioned to transfer items. Inserters without fuel or facing the wrong direction will not function.\n\n#### Errors when mining with out-of-fuel drills\n- Always ensure mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Refuel drills regularly to avoid interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and the required ingredients to smelt. Check the input chests and inserters for proper item flow.\n\n#### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue operating. Full chests will halt resource extraction."}
