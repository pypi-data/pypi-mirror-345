{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5) generating power.\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0) connected via pipes, currently out of fuel.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler to the steam engine, facilitating steam flow.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab connected to the power supply, currently not conducting any research.\n\n### Pipe Infrastructure\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 2864) at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5), currently empty.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 2871) at position (x=-0.5, y=22.5), actively working with steam.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), providing power distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Setting Research\n- Ensure that a valid research topic is selected and that the lab is supplied with the necessary science packs to initiate research.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Verify that all pipe connections are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine to ensure proper steam flow.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to maintain continuous power generation. Ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory for refueling.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors in Resource Verification\n- Double-check connections and resource availability before verifying connections to prevent unnecessary verification errors."}
