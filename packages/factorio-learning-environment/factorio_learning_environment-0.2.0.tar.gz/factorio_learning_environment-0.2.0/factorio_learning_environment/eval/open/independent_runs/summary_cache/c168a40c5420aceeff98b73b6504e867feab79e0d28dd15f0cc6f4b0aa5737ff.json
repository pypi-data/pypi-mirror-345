{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Positioning\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the chest and furnace. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items like coal into entities, verify that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Check that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity to prevent placement errors. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position as necessary to accommodate existing entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Fuel Shortages\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation and prevent stoppages due to lack of fuel."}
