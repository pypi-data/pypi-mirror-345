{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of various PipeGroups connecting different parts of the facility:\n- PipeGroup at position (-42.5, -124.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-50.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-44.5, -121.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-48.5, -119.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups in the vicinity of positions (-1.5, 11.5), (-0.5, 17.5), (-12.5, 23.5), (-4.5, 24.5), (1.5, 24.5), and (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including positions like (-0.5, -92.5), (3.5, -92.5), (4.5, -93.5), and others.\n\n### Laboratory Setup\n- Lab with no research in progress, positioned near the electricity network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between entities such as boilers, steam engines, and offshore pumps. Verify that there are no obstructions and that the connections are valid.\n\n### Errors When Connecting to Power Network\n- Before attempting to connect entities like labs to the power network, ensure that you have the required items, such as Small Electric Poles, in your inventory.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- When crafting items, ensure that all required raw resources, such as wood for Small Electric Poles, are available in your inventory. Gather necessary resources before crafting.\n\n### Errors in Setting Research\n- Verify that the research queue is correctly set and that all prerequisites for the desired research are met. Ensure that the lab is powered and has the necessary science packs.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Always check that the tile where you intend to place an entity is not occupied by another object. Plan the layout to avoid overlaps and ensure efficient use of space."}
