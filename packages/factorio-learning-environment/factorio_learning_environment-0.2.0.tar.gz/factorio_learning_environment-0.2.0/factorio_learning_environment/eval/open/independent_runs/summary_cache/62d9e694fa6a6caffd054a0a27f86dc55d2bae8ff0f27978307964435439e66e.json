{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working but the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). The furnace at (-15.0, -48.0) is working with iron ore and coal, producing iron plates. The furnace at (-13.0, -48.0) is also working, but the furnace at (-11.0, -48.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is regularly emptied to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items such as coal into furnaces, verify that the items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and supply the necessary ingredients to the furnaces to maintain continuous production and avoid idle time.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs when the item is not available in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **furnace**: Represents the furnace entity being interacted with for insertion operations.\n- **inventory**: A dictionary tracking the current items and quantities available to the agent."}
