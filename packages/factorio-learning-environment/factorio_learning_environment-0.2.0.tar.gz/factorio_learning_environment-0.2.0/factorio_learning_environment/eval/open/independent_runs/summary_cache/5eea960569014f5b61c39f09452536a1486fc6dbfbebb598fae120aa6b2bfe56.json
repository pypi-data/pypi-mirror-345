{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)**: Supplied with iron ore and fueled with coal, currently working.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5)**: Picks up from the furnace at (0.0, 0.0) and drops into a wooden chest at (2.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)**: Stores iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate and Copper Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest at position (7.5, 0.5)**: Stores iron plates and copper plates.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (6.5, 0.5)**: Transfers items from a transport belt to the chest at (7.5, 0.5).\n\n### Iron Plate and Copper Plate Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0)**: Supplied with iron ore and fueled with coal, currently working.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5)**: Picks up from the furnace at (10.0, 0.0) and drops into a wooden chest at (12.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5)**: Stores iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)**: Extracts coal and drops it into a chest at (40.5, -83.5).\n- **Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (41.5, -83.5), (42.5, -83.5)**: Store extracted coal and iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Belt Group**: Connects various entities, including a segment from (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and another from (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when removing entities\n- Avoid attempting to remove entities that are not properly referenced or callable. Ensure the entity is correctly identified and accessible.\n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables and entities are properly defined before use. For example, use the correct entity class names like `burner_inserter` instead of undefined names like `BurnerInserter`.\n\n### Errors with entity status handling\n- Check that entity status checks use valid attributes and methods. Avoid using attributes that do not exist for the entity type.\n\n### Errors with item prototypes\n- Verify that item prototypes are valid and correctly referenced in the code. Ensure the item exists in the game data before using it in operations."}
