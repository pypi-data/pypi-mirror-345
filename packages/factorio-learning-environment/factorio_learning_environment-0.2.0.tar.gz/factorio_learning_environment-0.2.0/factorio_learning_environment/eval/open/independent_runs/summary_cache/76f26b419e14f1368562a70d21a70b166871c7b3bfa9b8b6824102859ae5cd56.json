{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has attempted multiple placements, but none have been successful. As a result, no entities have been placed, and no structures have been created.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place an entity. The agent attempted to place various entities (e.g., Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, Iron Chest, Transport Belt) at different locations, but all attempts failed.\n\n### Errors related to incorrect data handling\n- Ensure that data types are correctly handled when processing movement or placement commands. The error \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" suggests an issue with data type handling, possibly due to incorrect indexing or parameter passing.\n\n### Errors due to global constraints\n- Check for any global constraints or settings that might be affecting placement. The agent encountered issues related to global constraints, which may have prevented successful placement of entities."}
