{"content": "### Error Analysis\nThe error indicates that there was an attempt to craft a Stone Furnace using a recipe that does not exist in the current context. Specifically, it suggests that the crafting process is trying to reference \"stone\" as an intermediate item, which is incorrect because stone is a raw resource and must be gathered directly rather than crafted.\n\n### Steps Taken\n1. **Crafted 3 Iron Gear Wheels**: This step was successful, and the inventory was updated accordingly.\n2. **Crafted a Stone Furnace**: This step failed due to the error regarding the crafting of stone as an intermediate resource.\n3. **Checked Coal Inventory**: This step was intended to ensure we had enough coal for the furnace.\n4. **Placed Stone Furnace**: This step was planned but not executed due to the previous error.\n5. **Inserted Resources into the Furnace**: This step was also planned but not executed due to the previous error.\n6. **Crafted Burner Mining Drill**: This step was contingent upon the successful placement of the Stone Furnace and was not reached.\n\n### Corrective Actions\n1. **Verify Resource Availability**: Before crafting, ensure that all required resources are available in the inventory.\n2. **Correct Crafting Logic**: Ensure that the crafting function is called only when all necessary resources are available and correctly referenced.\n3. **Gather Resources**: If any resources are missing, gather them before attempting to craft.\n\n### Revised Steps\n1. **Check Inventory for Stones**: Ensure that we have enough stones before attempting to craft the Stone Furnace.\n2. **Gather Stones if Necessary**: If stones are insufficient, gather them from the nearest stone patch.\n3. **Craft the Stone Furnace**: Once we confirm we have enough stones, proceed to craft the Stone Furnace.\n4. **Check Coal Inventory**: Ensure we have coal for the furnace.\n5. **Place the Stone Furnace**: Position the furnace at a valid location.\n6. **Insert Fuel and Resources**: Insert coal and iron ore into the furnace for smelting.\n7. **Craft the Burner Mining Drill**: After ensuring all conditions are met.\n\n### Implementation\nLet's implement the revised steps to ensure that we can successfully craft the Stone Furnace and proceed to craft the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check if we have enough stones to craft the Stone Furnace\navailable_stone = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Stone, 0)\n\n# If we don't have enough stones, we need to gather them\nif available_stone < 5:\n    print(\"Not enough stones available.
