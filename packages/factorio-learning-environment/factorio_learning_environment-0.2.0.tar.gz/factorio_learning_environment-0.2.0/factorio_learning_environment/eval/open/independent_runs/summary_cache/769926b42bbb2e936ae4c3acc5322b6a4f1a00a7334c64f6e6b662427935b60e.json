Always verify that both source and target connection interfaces are unobstructed, correctly aligned, and that the pipe count meets the calculated requirements.\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Issues:\n\u2003 \u2013 Several errors occurred from attempting placements without confirming inventory levels (e.g. the initial absence of an offshore pump). Confirm both that the target tile is buildable and that the necessary inventory item is available prior to placement.\n\u2022 Crafting Ingredient Shortages:\n\u2003 \u2013 Attempts to craft additional pipes or related items failed when essential sub-ingredients (such as the required iron plates) were missing. Ensure that sufficient raw materials and an operable production or smelting facility are available before initiating such crafting routines.\n\u2022 Attribute Access Errors:\n\u2003 \u2013 An error was triggered by attempting to call a property (using parentheses on a 'Position' object) when computing a water patch center. Access the attribute directly rather than as a function to avoid this mistake.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nget_connection_amount(boiler: Entity, extra_se: Entity, connection_type: Prototype) -> int  \n\u2003 \u2013 Determines the necessary number of pipes to connect two entities; raises an exception if connectivity or spatial conditions are not met.\n\nplace_entity(entity_type: Prototype, position: Position, direction: Direction) -> Entity  \n\u2003 \u2013 Attempts to place an entity of the specified type at the given position and orientation; fails if the tile is occupied or if the inventory lacks the required item.\n\ncraft_item(item: Prototype, quantity: int) -> int  \n\u2003 \u2013 Initiates crafting for a specified item and quantity; throws an exception if essential sub-ingredients or a functional production facility is unavailable.\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 inventory: dict[str, int] \u2014 Represents the current inventory of items.\n\u2022 boiler: Entity \u2014 Refers to the boiler located at (8.0, 20.5).\n\u2022 extra_se: Entity \u2014 Denotes the extra steam engine at (11.5, 18.5).\n\u2022 new_buildable_area: BuildableArea \u2014 Used to determine available buildable regions via its center property."}
