{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting to transfer items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest to another storage or processing unit.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) as an intermediary storage for coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting to transfer coal from the intermediary storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters are not empty or blocked. Check that the inserters have access to the required items to transfer.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty chests that are used as drop positions for mining drills to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to prevent downtime in production. Check inserters and supply lines to ensure they are functioning correctly.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
