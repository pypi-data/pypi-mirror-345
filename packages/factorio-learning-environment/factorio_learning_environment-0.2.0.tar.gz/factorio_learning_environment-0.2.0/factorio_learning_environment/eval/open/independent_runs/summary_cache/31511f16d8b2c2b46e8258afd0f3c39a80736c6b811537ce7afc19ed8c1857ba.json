This can be achieved by checking the inventory of the source chest and the available space in the destination before executing the extraction command.\n\n### Errors when Refueling Inserters and Drills\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of inserters and drills to ensure they are not running out of fuel. This can be automated by setting up a refueling system or by manually refueling them at regular intervals.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. Implement a system to transfer excess items to other storage or processing facilities."}
