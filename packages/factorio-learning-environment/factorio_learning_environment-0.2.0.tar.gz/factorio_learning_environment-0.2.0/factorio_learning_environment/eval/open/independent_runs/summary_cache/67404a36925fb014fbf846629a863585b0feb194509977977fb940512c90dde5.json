{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) which holds coal (55 units).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) which is currently fueled with coal (48 units) and is operational.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) which has coal (50 units) as fuel and is producing iron plates (100 units) but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from wooden chest\n- Ensure you are within range of the wooden chest when attempting to extract items. The current logs indicate repeated failures due to being out of range.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Verify that the target entity (e.g., burner mining drill) is available for insertion. If the chest is full, it will prevent further mining operations.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the location where you intend to place an entity (like the wooden chest) is clear and accessible before placing it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, wooden_chest, quantity=50)`: This function failed multiple times due to the wooden chest being out of range.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `wooden_chest`: Type: Inventory, Count: 1\n- `coal`: Type: Integer, Count: 3370\n- `iron_plate`: Type: Integer, Count: 821\n- `burner_mining_drill`: Type: Entity, Position: (41.0, -82.0)\n- `stone_furnace`: Type: Entity, Position: (-15.0, -50.0)"}
