{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and a Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) with iron ore inserted and iron plates being produced.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0) with iron ore inserted and iron plates being produced.\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=43.5, y=-83.5), and (x=44.5, y=-83.5) storing coal.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various positions, including:\n  - BeltGroup from (x=45.5, y=-82.5) to (x=67.5, y=-54.5).\n  - BeltGroup from (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=63.5, y=-50.5).\n  - BeltGroup from (x=42.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.5, y=-46.5).\n  - BeltGroup from (x=44.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.5, y=-54.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure that the path for connecting belts is valid and can be normalized. Verify that there are no obstructions or misalignments preventing the connection.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the inserters have access to source items. Check the inventory of the entities feeding into the inserters to ensure they are not empty.\n\n### Furnace Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Automate fuel supply to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Ensure that the output of furnaces is being cleared regularly to prevent production halts. Use inserters to move items from the furnace to storage or further processing.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: This function attempts to connect entities using transport belts. It failed due to invalid paths, indicating a need for checking path validity before invocation.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `belt_to_inserter_1`: Represents a connection attempt between a belt and an inserter, which failed due to an invalid path.\n- Inventory variables such as `wooden-chest`, `transport-belt`, `burner-inserter`, `coal`, `iron-plate`, and `iron-gear-wheel` are crucial for managing resources and logistics."}
