{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (1 unit)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities like Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts is unoccupied before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the existence of entities at the specified positions before attempting to retrieve them. For example, ensure a Stone Furnace exists at the intended position before calling retrieval functions.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept outputs from entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for entities like Stone Furnaces to function properly and avoid status issues like \"No Ingredients\"."}
