{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully placed or constructed on the map. The agent attempted to place wooden chests at various coordinates, but all attempts failed due to placement issues or obstructions. Therefore, there are no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Ensure that the target location for placing chests is clear of obstructions. The agent repeatedly attempted to place chests at various coordinates but failed due to obstructions or invalid placement conditions. Always check for nearby entities that might block placement.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables or functions\n- Correctly define and import necessary modules and functions. The agent encountered a `NameError` due to the undefined name 'builtins'. Ensure all required functions and modules are properly defined and accessible in the script.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect function usage\n- Verify function calls and object methods. The agent encountered a `TypeError` when attempting to call a method on a 'Position' object that is not callable. Ensure that methods are correctly used and that objects are manipulated using appropriate methods.\n\n### Lack of resources\n- Monitor resource levels to ensure sufficient supply. The agent repeatedly noted a lack of iron ore to supply to furnaces. Ensure that resource gathering and supply chains are established to maintain production."}
