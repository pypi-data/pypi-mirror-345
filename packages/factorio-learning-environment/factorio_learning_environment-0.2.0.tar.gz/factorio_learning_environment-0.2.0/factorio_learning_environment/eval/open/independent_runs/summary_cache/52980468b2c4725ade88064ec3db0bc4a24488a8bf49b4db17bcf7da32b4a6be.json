{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-48.0).\n- Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Inserter at position (x=-12.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-47.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. If a tile is already occupied, consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position.\n\n### Misalignment of inserters\n- Verify the alignment of inserters with their source and destination entities. Ensure the pickup and drop positions match the intended entities to avoid misalignment.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting for source items, check the source entity's inventory and status.\n\n### Output blocked by items on the ground\n- Clear any items blocking the output of entities like mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Ensure there is a sink entity to accept the output."}
