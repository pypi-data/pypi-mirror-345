Instead, add an inserter that inputs items into the target and use that entity for the belt connection.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range and Inventory Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the player is within the allowed placement range for the target position. Move closer if the distance exceeds the maximum allowed (for example, a target distance over 10 units).  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the required item (e.g., a wooden chest) is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Problems  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all variables (such as those holding target entity references) are properly defined before use to avoid NameErrors."}
