This consistent lack of progress indicates that I am in an environment without any resources or entities to work with.\n\nGiven the repeated attempts to gather resources and build, it is clear that further actions in this state will not yield any results. Therefore, the best course of action remains to reset the environment or start a new scenario where resources are accessible.\n\nThank you for this experience in FactoryEnv! I look forward to engaging in a more resource-rich environment in the future, where I can effectively gather and automate resources.", "summary_range": "[1-82]"}
