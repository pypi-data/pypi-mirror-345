## 😮 About <a name = "about"></a>

**Botato** is a Discord bot framework designed for developers who want clarity, simplicity, and reliability.
Where other frameworks suffer from outdated docs, bloated abstractions, and lack of transparency, Botato provides a modern, well-typed, extensible alternative.

It includes a dynamic Gateway client, a fast REST API wrapper, JSON-driven intent management, and typed data models powered by Pydantic.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Poetry ([https://python-poetry.org/docs/](https://python-poetry.org/docs/))
* A Discord bot token

### Installing

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivkun/botato.git && cd botato
poetry install
```

*Botato is also available on PyPI and is updated with every release. You can install it using `pip`, `pipx`, or `poetry`.*

> [!NOTE]
> - `pip`is the standard Python package manager and is suitable for installing packages globally or in virtual environments.
> - `pipx` is designed for installing and running Python applications in isolated environments, making it idea for CLI tools.
> - `poetry` is a dependency management and packaging tool that creates virtual environments and manages dependencies for your projects.

```bash
pip install botato
pipx install botato
poetry add botato
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
poetry env activate
```

Run the example bot:

```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-token-here poetry run python examples/basic_bot.py
```

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

To run the test suite:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Register events with decorators:

```python
from botato.models.message import Message

@bot.event
async def on_message_create(message: Message):
    print(f"{message.author.username}: {message.content}")
```

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

For production usage, you can use a process manager like `systemd`, `supervisord`, or `pm2` (for cross-platform Python apps).

Make sure to secure your token using environment variables or secret managers.
