Multiple attempts to place Wooden Chests and a Stone Furnace failed due to unsuitable positions.\n\n### Errors in movement commands\n- When using movement commands, ensure that the indices used are integers. Errors occurred due to incorrect data types being used for movement commands.\n\n### Errors related to obstacles\n- Before placing entities, perform a thorough scan to identify obstacles in the intended area. This will help in planning placements and avoiding failed placement attempts due to obstacles."}
