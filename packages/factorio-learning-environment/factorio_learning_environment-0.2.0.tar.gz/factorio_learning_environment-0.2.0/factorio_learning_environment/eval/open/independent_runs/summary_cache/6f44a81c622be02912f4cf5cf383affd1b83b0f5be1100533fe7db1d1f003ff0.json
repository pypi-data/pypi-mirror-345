Avoid using non-callable objects like 'Chest' in this context.\n\n### Errors due to full chests blocking operations\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills and other entities from halting operations due to lack of space.\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check the inventory of source entities and ensure they are not empty."}
