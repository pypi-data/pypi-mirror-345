{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). The drill is currently working and has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chests for storage:\n  - Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing 336 units of iron ore.\n  - Additional chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), and (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) each containing 100 units of iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests storing iron plates at various positions:\n  - Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5), each with varying quantities of iron plates.\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) containing 326 units of iron ore and 1700 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0). All furnaces have warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt and that the furnace result is full, each containing 100 iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items into chests\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the items you wish to transfer before attempting to insert them into a chest. The agent attempted to insert iron ore into a chest without having any in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check the status of chests to ensure they are not full before attempting to transfer items. The agent encountered issues with full chests, which halted operations.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- Utility functions:\n  - `insert_item`: This function was invoked to transfer items into chests. It failed when there were no items in the inventory to transfer, indicating a need for inventory checks before invocation.\n\n- Important variables:\n  - `target_chest`: Used for storing the target chest entity for item insertion.\n  - `iron_ore_to_transfer`: Presumably used to specify the quantity of iron ore to transfer."}
