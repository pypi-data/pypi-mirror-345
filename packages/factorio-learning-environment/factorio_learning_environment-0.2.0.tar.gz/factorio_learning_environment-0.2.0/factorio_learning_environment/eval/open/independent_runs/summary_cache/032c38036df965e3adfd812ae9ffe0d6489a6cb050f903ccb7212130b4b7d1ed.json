{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) that extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) that stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5) that is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) that is supposed to smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position to avoid alignment errors. The pickup position should match the chest's position exactly.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Drop Position\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position is correctly aligned with the furnace's position to ensure proper transfer of materials.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inserter setup to confirm that it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as the burner mining drill and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations."}
