{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Steam engine at position (27.5, -7.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with inserters and electric poles facilitating production\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (20.0, 20.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (19.5, 18.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with inserters and electric poles facilitating production\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserters and electric poles for input and output\n- Belt group connecting the stone furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) to the assembling machine\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (19.5, -16.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT\n- PipeGroup at position (15.5, -14.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT\n- PipeGroup at position (19.5, -12.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (7.5, -7.5) with status EMPTY\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, providing power to connected entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are feasible between the offshore pump and the boiler. Check the alignment and distance between entities before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers to avoid the 'out of fuel' status which prevents steam production.\n\n### Errors with Assembling Machine\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has the necessary resources, like copper plates, to produce copper cables. Check resource availability regularly.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Verify that the correct attributes are being accessed. For example, ensure that the 'ElectricityGroup' object has a 'voltage' attribute before attempting to access it.\n\n### Inserter and Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are placed correctly and have access to power. Check the electricity network to confirm that all inserters are connected to a power source."}
