{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, -62.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, -62.0) and steam engine (position 2.5, -58.5). The boiler is responsible for converting water into steam using fuel, while the steam engine generates electricity from the steam produced.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-67.5, -98.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -67.5, -98.5) which extracts water from the sea for use in the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Lab at position(0.5, -60.5)\nConsists of lab (position 0.5, -60.5) which is used for research purposes.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-58.5, -114.5)\nConsists of a series of pipes that transport water from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### ElectricityGroup\nConsists of small electric poles that distribute electricity across the structures.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items from inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, you cannot insert coal into the boiler if you do not have coal available.\n\n### Errors when boiler is not operational\n- Check the fuel supply to the boiler. Ensure that it has enough fuel to operate.\n\n### Errors when steam engine is not generating power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that it has a supply of steam. Ensure that the boiler is operational.\n\n### Errors when lab is not receiving power\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to the electricity network. Check the connections and the status of nearby electric poles.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
