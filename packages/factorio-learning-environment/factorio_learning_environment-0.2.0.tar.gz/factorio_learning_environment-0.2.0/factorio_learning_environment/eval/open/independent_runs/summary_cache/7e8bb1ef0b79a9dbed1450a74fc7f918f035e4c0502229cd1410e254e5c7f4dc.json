{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete)\nLocated around position (-7, 23.5), consists of:\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 23.5) facing right\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5) connected to boiler\nThe system is currently non-functional due to lack of fuel and missing steam engine.\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\nLocated around position (8-14, 1.5), consists of:\n- Input chest at (8.5, 1.5) containing iron plates, copper plates and iron gear wheels\n- Inserter at (9.5, 1.5) to feed materials\n- Assembling machine at (11.5, 1.5) for crafting automation science packs\n- Output inserter at (13.5, 1.5)\n- Output chest at (14.5, 1.5) containing finished science packs\nCurrently non-functional due to lack of power.\n\n### Smelting Area\nLocated around position (0-8, 0), consists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (5.0, 0.0), and (8.0, 0.0)\n- Burner inserter at (3.5, 0.5)\n- Input/output chests at (4.5, 1.5) and (8.5, 1.5)\n\n### Research Lab Complex\nMultiple labs connected to electricity network 40805, currently non-functional due to lack of power. Some labs contain automation science packs:\n- Lab with 56 automation science packs\n- Lab with 110 automation science packs\n- Lab with 31 automation science packs\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups connecting different parts of the factory:\n- Belt system from (4.5, 2.5) to (1.5, 5.5)\n- Belt system from (6.5, 2.5) to (4.5, 2.5)\n- Long belt system from (7.5, 3.5) to (-4.5, 19.5)\n- Belt system from (1.5, 5.5) to (1.5, 11.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to entity placement\n- Verify target location is clear of existing objects before placing new entities\n- Check surrounding area for conflicting entities when placing larger structures\n\n### Errors related to fuel insertion\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity when attempting to insert fuel\n- Verify the entity can accept the type of fuel you're trying to insert\n- Check that you actually have the fuel item in your inventory before attempting to insert\n\n### Errors related to item extraction\n- Move closer to the target entity before attempting to extract items\n- Verify the entity contains the items you're trying to extract\n\n### Power system connection errors\n- Ensure all components of power system (boiler, offshore pump, steam engine) are properly connected\n- Place components in correct order and orientation\n- Verify fuel is available and inserted before expecting power generation\n\n### Mining errors\n- Verify mined resources are actually being added to inventory\n- Check inventory space before mining\n- Ensure you're at the correct position to mine the target resource"}
