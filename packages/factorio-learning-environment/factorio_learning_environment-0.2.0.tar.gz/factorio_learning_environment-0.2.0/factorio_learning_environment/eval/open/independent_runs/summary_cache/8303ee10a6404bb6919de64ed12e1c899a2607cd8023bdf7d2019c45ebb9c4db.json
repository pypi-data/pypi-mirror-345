{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) for transferring items between the drill, furnace, and chest.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting from empty chests\n- Ensure the chest has sufficient items before attempting to extract. Repeatedly extracting from an empty chest wastes actions and time.\n\n#### Errors with burner mining drill running out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner mining drill to avoid interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n#### Errors with furnaces lacking ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces are supplied with both fuel and raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to maintain continuous production.\n\n#### Errors with burner inserter waiting for source items\n- Verify that the inserter has access to items to transfer. Ensure the source entity (e.g., chest or drill) has items available.\n\n#### Errors with furnaces being idle\n- Monitor furnaces to ensure they are always supplied with both fuel and raw materials to avoid downtime."}
