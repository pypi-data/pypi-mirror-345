{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at (52.0, -79.0)\n- **Furnace** at (52.0, -79.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Inserter** at (53.5, -79.5): Transfers iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n- **Chest** at (53.5, -78.5): Stores the produced iron plates.\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at (41.0, -82.0): Mines coal from the resource patch.\n- **Inserter** at (42.5, -80.5): Transfers coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- **Chest** at (41.5, -80.5): Stores the mined coal.\n- **Chest** at (43.5, -80.5): Additional storage for coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure the player is within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) before attempting to place an entity.\n\n#### Incorrect inserter drop positions\n- Verify the inserter's drop position matches the target chest's position before asserting its correctness.\n\n#### Inserter not working\n- Ensure the inserter has sufficient fuel and is correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Rotate the inserter if necessary to align it with the source and destination.\n\n#### Assertion errors for item transfer\n- Confirm that the chest or furnace has the expected items before asserting their presence. Ensure the inserter is functioning correctly to transfer items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **place_entity(Prototype, position)**: Places an entity at the specified position. Fails if the position is too far or occupied.\n- **rotate_inserter(inserter, direction)**: Rotates an inserter to face the specified direction.\n- **add_fuel(entity, fuel_type, amount)**: Adds fuel to an entity. Fails if the entity does not accept the fuel type.\n\n#### Variables\n- **output_chest**: `WoodenChest` at (53.5, -78.5), stores iron plates.\n- **inserter**: `BurnerInserter` at (53.5, -79.5), transfers iron plates.\n- **furnace**: `StoneFurnace` at (52.0, -79.0), smelts iron ore.\n- **mining_drill**: `BurnerMiningDrill` at (41.0, -82.0), mines coal."}
