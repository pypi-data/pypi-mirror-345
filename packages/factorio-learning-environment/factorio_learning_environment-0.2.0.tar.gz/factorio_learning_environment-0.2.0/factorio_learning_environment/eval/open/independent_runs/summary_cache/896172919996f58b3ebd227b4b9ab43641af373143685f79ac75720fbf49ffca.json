While the steam engine now reports a working status, the boiler remains unfueled.\n\n### Pipe Production Facility at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine (position: 3.5, 0.5) \u2013 Configured for pipe crafting; currently exhibiting an ingredient shortage (missing iron-plate sub-ingredient).\n- Iron Chest (position: 1.5, 0.5) \u2013 Stores crafted pipes.\n- Electricity Network: Small Electric Poles located at (2.5, 2.5), (3.5, 2.5), (4.5, 3.5), (6.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), (3.5, -2.5) and (3.5, -1.5).\n\u2003Note: An attempted pole placement at (4.5, 0.5) failed due to an obstruction.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Steam Pipeline Connection and Alignment Errors\n\u2003- Reassess and adjust connection endpoints and intermediate waypoints to ensure proper alignment; verify that both source and target connection points are unobstructed and within range.\n\u2003- Reposition entities or clear surrounding blockages when errors report failure to connect between designated pipe positions.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Pipe Inventory\n\u2003- Before initiating segmented steam connections, check that the available pipe count meets the required number for the entire connection. Craft additional pipes as needed.\n\n\u2022 Fluid Mismatch and Stale Connection Issues\n\u2003- Clear stale pipe entities from the connection region to avoid residual fluid mismatches.\n\u2003- Monitor the fluid contents at pipe junctions to ensure that only the expected fluids are present for successful connection.\n\n\u2022 Boiler Fuel Management\n\u2003- Maintain continuous monitoring of boiler fuel levels; harvest and insert sufficient coal promptly to avoid recurring NO_FUEL status that disrupts connection stability.\n\n\u2022 General Connection and Placement Issues\n\u2003- Verify that intended placement tiles for connection endpoints are clear and free from obstructions.\n\u2003- Ensure positional accuracy when moving the player and deploying connection segments to mitigate recurrent \u201cfailed to connect\u201d errors."}
