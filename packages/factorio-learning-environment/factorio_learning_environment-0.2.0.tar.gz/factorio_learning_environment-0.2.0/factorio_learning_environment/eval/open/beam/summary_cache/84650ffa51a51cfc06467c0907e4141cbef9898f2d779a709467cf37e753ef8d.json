{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe inspection results indicate the following:\n\n### Stone Furnace Inventory:\n- **Iron Ore**: 6 units (currently in the furnace)\n\n### Current Total Inventory:\n- **Coal**: 5 units (available for use)\n- **Stone**: 15 units\n- **Iron Plates**: 5 units\n- **Copper Cables**: 18 units\n- **Iron Gear Wheels**: 8 units\n\n### Summary:\nIt appears that the furnace has **6 units of iron ore** already present, which I was unaware of. Additionally, I have **5 units of coal** remaining in my inventory, which is not enough to fuel the furnace for further operations.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Insert the 6 units of iron ore from the furnace into my inventory** to increase the total available iron ore.\n2. **Check the furnace status again after extraction** to see how many iron plates have been produced.\n3. **Gather more coal** if necessary to continue smelting operations.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the 6 units of iron ore from the furnace.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the 6 units of iron ore from the stone furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.IronOre, new_stone_furnace.position, quantity=6)  # Extract the iron ore from the furnace\n\n# Check the status of the stone furnace and current inventory after extraction\nprint(f\"Furnace Status after extraction: {inspect_inventory(new_stone_furnace)}\")  # Check furnace status\nprint(f\"Current Inventory after extraction: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory after extraction\n\n# Check the total iron plates produced in the furnace\ntotal_iron_plates = inspect_inventory()[Prototype.IronPlate]\nprint(f\"Total Iron Plates Available now: {total_iron_plates}\")  # Display total iron plates available after extraction", "summary_range": "[1-144]"}
