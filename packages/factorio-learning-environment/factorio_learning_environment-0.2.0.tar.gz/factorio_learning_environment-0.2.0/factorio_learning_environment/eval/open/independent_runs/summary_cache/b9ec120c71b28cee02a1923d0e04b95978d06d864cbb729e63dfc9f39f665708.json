{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and supplied with iron ore.\n  - Produces iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-16.0, -49.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and supplied with iron ore.\n  - Produces iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-18.0, -49.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and supplied with iron ore.\n  - Produces iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n  - Transfers iron plates from the furnace at (-14.0, -49.0) to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-13.5, -46.5)\n  - Stores iron plates transferred by the burner inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing structures\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to place structures. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with item insertion\n- Verify that the inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to insert them into structures. Attempting to insert iron ore without having it in the inventory will cause an error.\n\n### Errors with data types during placement\n- Ensure that all parameters, such as dimensions, are valid integers when placing structures. Invalid data types can cause placement errors.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
