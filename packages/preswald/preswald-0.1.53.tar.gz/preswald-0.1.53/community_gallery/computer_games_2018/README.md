# Computer Games Preswald Project

## About

* The dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/computer-games-dataset
* This project filters our dataset by release date and visualizes the games by developer, genre, and operating system
* Filtering by date first is essential due to the amount of games released per year, and the ever-growing number of genres and studios; too many games and the data is nearly unreadable
* To run this project, first `pip install preswald`
* Then run with `preswald run`
