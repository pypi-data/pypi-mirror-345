Check the surrounding area before placing.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place pipes\n- Verify the position before placing pipes to ensure they are not overlapping with existing entities or invalid terrain. Use positions that are confirmed to be empty.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target location."}
