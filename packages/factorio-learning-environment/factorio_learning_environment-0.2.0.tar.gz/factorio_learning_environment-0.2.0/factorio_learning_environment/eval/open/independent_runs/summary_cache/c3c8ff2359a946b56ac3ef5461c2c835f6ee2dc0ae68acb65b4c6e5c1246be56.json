{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) with drop position (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) containing 4 coal and 20 iron plates\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel in mining drill\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) with drop position (-20.5, -71.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) containing 2 coal and 14 copper plates\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel in mining drill\n\n### Smelting Area near Origin\nGroup of furnaces each containing 23 coal:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab containing 10 automation science packs\nCurrently not functioning due to lack of power\n\n### Power Generation System (Under Construction)\nCurrent setup consists of:\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) containing 44 coal\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups scattered across the area with one main water-carrying pipe group\nCurrently not functioning due to incomplete setup and steam engine placement issues\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Steam engines cannot be placed where existing objects are present\n- Ensure the entire 3x5 tile footprint for steam engine is clear before placement\n- Check for and remove any pipes or other entities in the target placement area\n\n### Power System Connection Issues\n- Despite multiple attempts at pipe cleanup, pipe groups are still accumulating\n- Need more thorough pipe removal process that includes:\n  * Removing all pipe groups first\n  * Double checking for remaining individual pipes\n  * Only then creating new connections\n- Create a single, direct water connection from pump to boiler before adding steam engine\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drills and furnaces need constant fuel supply to operate\n- Maintain fuel levels in all burner devices to prevent operation interruption\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Electric poles must be properly connected to form a complete power network\n- Ensure power consumers (like labs) are within range of electric poles\n\n### Steam Engine Placement Strategy\n- Place steam engine first, then connect with pipes\n- Keep adequate space between boiler and steam engine\n- Verify the entire placement area is clear of obstacles\n- Consider placing steam engine before creating pipe connections to avoid interference"}
