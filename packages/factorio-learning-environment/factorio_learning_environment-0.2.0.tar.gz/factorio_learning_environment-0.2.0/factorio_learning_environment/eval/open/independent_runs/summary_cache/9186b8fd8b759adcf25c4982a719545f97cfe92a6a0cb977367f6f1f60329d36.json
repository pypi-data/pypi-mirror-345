{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) and a stone furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position x=60.0 is not directly connected to a furnace in the provided logs, but there is a stone furnace at position x=60.0, y=-60.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nNo direct evidence of a copper cable factory is provided in the logs, but there are burner inserters and transport belts that could be part of such a structure.\n\n### Electricity generator at position(x=111.5, y=-32.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position x=106.5, y=-32.5)\n- Boiler (position x=111.5, y=-32.0)\n- Steam engine (position x=117.5, y=-30.5)\n- Pipe groups (positions x=107.5, y=-34.5 and x=105.5, y=-32.5)\n\n### Transport system\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt group (position x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n- Transport belts (positions x=63.5, y=-53.5 and x=64.5, y=-53.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using burner entities without fuel\n- Ensure that burner entities (such as burner mining drills and burner inserters) have fuel before attempting to use them.\n### Errors when using entities without ingredients\n- Ensure that entities (such as stone furnaces) have the necessary ingredients before attempting to use them.\n### Errors when using steam engines without connection\n- Ensure that steam engines are connected to a power network before attempting to use them.\n### Errors when using pipe groups without fluid\n- Ensure that pipe groups have fluid before attempting to use them.\n### Errors when using electricity groups without being plugged into an electric network\n- Ensure that electricity groups are plugged into an electric network before attempting to use them.\n\n# NAMESPACE\nNo information is provided about the namespace or type-annotated utility functions in the given logs. \nHowever, the following variables are assigned:\n* Entity positions (x, y coordinates)\n* Entity statuses (e.g. EntityStatus.NO_FUEL, EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS)\n* Entity types (e.g. burner-mining-drill, stone-furnace, burner-inserter)"}
