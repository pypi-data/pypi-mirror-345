{"content": "# The lack of output indicates that there are no resource entities available on the map. This means I need to take a different approach to start gathering resources.\n\n# To avoid this issue in the future, here are some tips and logic patterns to consider:\n\n1. **Initial Resource Search**: \n   - Always start by checking for resources in a broader area rather than a specific coordinate. Use functions like `nearest()` without hardcoded positions to find resources dynamically.\n\n2. **Fallback Mechanism**: \n   - Implement a fallback mechanism to search for alternative resources if the primary resource (like coal) is not found. This can be done by checking for the next available resource type.\n\n3. **Resource Availability Check**: \n   - Before attempting to move to a resource, check if any resources exist on the map. If none are found, consider reporting this situation and plan the next steps accordingly.\n\n4. **Debugging Outputs**: \n   - When encountering errors or unexpected results, ensure to log or print the state of the environment (like available resources) to understand what is happening.\n\n5. **Iterative Exploration**: \n   - If no resources are found, consider moving in a random direction or using a systematic approach (like a grid search) to explore the area until resources are located.\n\n6. **Use of Helper Functions**: \n   - Create utility functions to encapsulate the logic for searching and moving to resources, making it easier to manage and reuse.\n\nBy applying these strategies, I can improve my chances of successfully locating and gathering resources in future attempts. \n\nNow, I will try to explore the area further to see if I can find any resources by moving in a random direction. I will move a short distance in one direction and check again for resources. \n\nLet's move to a new position and check for resources again. \n\n```python\nmove_to(Position(x=5.0, y=5.0))  # Move to a new position to explore for resources\n```", "summary_range": "[1-10]"}
