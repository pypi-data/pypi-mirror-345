{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at position (2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n\u2013 Burner inserter (fuelled with coal) at Position(x=1.5, y=17.5)\n\u2013 Factory burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) \n\u2013 Auxiliary burner inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5)\n\u2013 Assembling machine-1 (producing copper-cable) at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5)\n\u2013 Output chest at Position(x=1.5, y=21.5)\n\nSubstructure \u2013 Depot Belt Network at approximately Position (3.5, 15.5):\n\u2003\u2022 Wooden chest (serving as a belt depot) at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\n\u2003\u2022 Transport belt segment at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5)\n\u2003\u2022 Depot burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5)\n\n### Extraction System at position (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n\u2013 Extraction system burner inserter with drop position at Position(x=-3.5, y=28.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-0.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Steam engine (generator) at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)\n\u2013 Boiler at Position(x=-5.5, y=24.0)\n\u2013 Offshore pump at Position(x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n\n### Smelting Setup at position (-3.0, 19.0)\nConsists of the following paired entities:\n\u2022 Stone furnace at Position(x=-3.0, y=19.0) with its associated wooden chest at Position(x=-4.5, y=18.5)\n\u2022 Stone furnace at Position(x=-4.0, y=21.0) with its associated wooden chest at Position(x=-5.5, y=21.5)\n\n### Science Lab\nConsists of the following entity:\n\u2013 Lab (lab_input: {'automation-science-pack': 17}, electrical_id=7106)\n\u2003(Position not specified)\n\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Errors\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple attempts failed with the message that transport belts cannot be connected directly to a Steam Engine target. Always ensure that an inserter (designed to input items into the Steam Engine) is placed and used as the connection target.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Errors\n\u2003\u2013 Errors occurred when trying to place a wooden chest at (3.5, 15.5) because the player was too far (distance exceeded the maximum allowed). Move closer to the target position before placing an entity.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Target Errors\n\u2003\u2013 A NameError was raised due to an undefined variable (target_chest). Double-check that all target entities are properly defined and referenced.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage Errors\n\u2003\u2013 An error indicating \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d was encountered when attempting placement. Verify that the required item is present in the inventory before attempting to place it."}
