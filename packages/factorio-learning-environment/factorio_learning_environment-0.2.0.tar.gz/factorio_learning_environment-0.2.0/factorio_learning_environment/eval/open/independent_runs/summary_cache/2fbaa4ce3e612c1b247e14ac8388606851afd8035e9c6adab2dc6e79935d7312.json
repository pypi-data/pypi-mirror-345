{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel. The furnace now has 49 units of coal in the fuel inventory and is actively working. It currently contains no ingredients to smelt and has 6 copper plates in the output inventory.\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (6.5, -57.5) with no power. The lab is set to research automation but is currently inactive due to lack of power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to place is available in your inventory. For example, attempting to place an offshore pump at position (-9.0, 25.0) failed because there was no offshore pump in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all the necessary materials before attempting to craft an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, but the agent had 0 stones available, leading to a crafting failure. Similarly, the agent was missing 3 copper plates needed to craft copper cables.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace failed because there was no coal in the inventory at that time.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient extraction of items\n- Ensure that the required number of items are available for extraction. For example, an assertion error occurred because the agent attempted to extract 10 iron plates but only 9 were available. Always check the available quantity before extraction to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect argument types\n- Ensure that you are passing the correct argument types to functions. An error occurred because a position was passed instead of an Entity or EntityGroup. Always check the function documentation to confirm the expected argument types.\n\n### Errors due to furnace not working after restocking\n- Ensure that the furnace has all necessary ingredients and conditions to start working after restocking. The agent restocked the furnace with coal, but it did not start working because there were no ingredients to smelt. Always verify that the furnace has both fuel and ingredients.\n\n### Errors due to missing iron ore in inventory\n- Ensure that you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. An error occurred because there was no iron ore in the inventory to insert into the furnace. Always check your inventory for the required materials before attempting to insert them into a furnace.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect inventory assertion\n- Ensure that the inventory assertion checks are correctly implemented. An assertion error occurred because the check for iron ore in the furnace inventory was incorrect. Always verify that the logic for inventory assertions aligns with the actual inventory state to prevent such errors.\n\n### Errors due to missing items for assembling machine\n- Ensure that all required items are available in the inventory before attempting to craft or assemble. An error was noted due to missing iron plates and electronic circuits needed for an assembling machine. Always check the inventory for necessary components before starting an assembly process.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient copper plates\n- Ensure that you have smelted enough copper plates before performing operations that require them. An assertion error occurred because the agent attempted to proceed with fewer than 3 copper plates smelted. Always verify the quantity of copper plates available to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect crafting process\n- Ensure that the crafting process is correctly followed, especially when crafting complex items that require sub-ingredients. An error occurred because the agent attempted to craft electronic circuits without having the necessary copper cables and copper plates. Always ensure that all sub-ingredients are available and correctly processed before attempting to craft complex items.\n\n### Errors due to no research in progress\n- Ensure that there is an active research project before attempting to check research progress. An error occurred because the agent tried to get research progress when no research was currently in progress. Always start a research project before querying its progress.\n\n### Errors during research setup due to crafting issues\n- Ensure that all sub-ingredients required for crafting research packs are available and can be crafted. An error occurred because the agent failed to craft automation-science-pack due to missing copper plates, which require a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace. Always verify the availability of sub-ingredients and the necessary equipment for crafting research packs.\n\n### Errors due to missing lab on the surface\n- Ensure that a lab is placed on the surface before attempting to find or interact with it. An error occurred because the agent tried to find the nearest lab, but none was present. Always verify the presence of necessary structures on the map before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients for crafting a lab\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available before attempting to"}
