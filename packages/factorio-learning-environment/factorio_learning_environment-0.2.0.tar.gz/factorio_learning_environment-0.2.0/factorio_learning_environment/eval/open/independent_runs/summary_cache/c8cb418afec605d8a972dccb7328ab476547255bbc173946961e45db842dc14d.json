{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map as of the current steps. The agent has attempted multiple placements, but all have failed due to various constraints.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to hidden constraints\n- Ensure there are no hidden constraints or restrictions in the buildable area before attempting to place entities. Investigate any potential map settings or game restrictions that might be affecting placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to map-wide restrictions\n- Confirm that there are no global constraints or map-wide restrictions that could prevent entity placement. Adjust game settings or choose different locations if necessary.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to cross-type issues\n- Verify that the type of entity being placed is compatible with the intended placement area. Check for any cross-type restrictions that might apply.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to persistent issues\n- Re-evaluate the placement strategy if persistent issues are encountered. Consider alternative approaches or locations for placing entities.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect data types in movement operations\n- Ensure that the correct data types are used in movement operations. Avoid using string indices when integer indices are required."}
