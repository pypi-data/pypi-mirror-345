{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed for extracting iron ore and processing it into iron plates.\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n  - Currently fueled with coal and operational.\n  - Warning: The chest at the drop position is full, preventing further mining.\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n  - Currently contains 5 units of iron ore.\n  - Warning: The chest is often full or low on space, requiring frequent emptying.\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace.\n  - Fueled with coal and operational, but often misaligned or waiting for source items.\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Fueled with coal but not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or lack of source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Frequent Misalignment of Inserter\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check and adjust its position to maintain efficiency.\n\n### Chest Overflow Issues\n- Regularly monitor and empty the chest to prevent overflow, which halts the mining process. Consider adding additional storage or increasing the frequency of manual emptying.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly positioned and operational. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that prevent the transfer of iron ore to the furnace.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure the chest contains sufficient iron ore for the inserter to transfer. If the chest is empty or low, replenish it to keep the production line moving.\n\n### Mining Drill Halted Due to Full Chest\n- Regularly empty the chest to allow the mining drill to continue extracting iron ore. Consider expanding storage capacity to accommodate more resources."}
