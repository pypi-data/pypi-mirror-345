{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 1})\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: [Ingredient(name='iron-ore', count=40000)]\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to move or place entities\n- **Cannot move Stone Furnace**: Ensure the target location for moving the Stone Furnace is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move it.\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, or Transport Belt**: Verify that the desired location is free of other entities or obstacles before placing these items.\n\n### Errors when interacting with non-existent entities\n- **Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace**: Double-check the position coordinates to ensure there is an entity of the specified type at that location before attempting to interact with it.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- **Output blocked by item on the ground**: Ensure there is a sink entity (such as a chest or belt) in place to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- **No ingredients to smelt**: Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients in its source inventory to perform smelting operations."}
