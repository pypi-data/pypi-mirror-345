{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0), which is currently waiting for space in the destination due to an output blockage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5), which is waiting for source items and has a warning that the chest is full.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0), which is out of fuel and contains 12 iron ore and 70 iron plates.\n- **Belt Group** connecting the mining drill and inserter, with verified transport belts at positions (x=43.5, y=-82.5) and (x=43.5, y=-80.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free before attempting to place a Wooden Chest or Burner Inserter. This will prevent placement errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at x=43.5 y=-79.5\" and \"Cannot place Burner Inserter at x=42.5 y=-79.5.\"\n\n### Errors due to output blockage\n- Address the warning \"output blocked by item on the ground\" by ensuring there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- The Burner Inserter has a warning \"chest is full.\" Make sure to regularly clear or expand storage to prevent inserters from becoming blocked.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- The Stone Furnace is out of fuel. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed to maintain continuous operation."}
