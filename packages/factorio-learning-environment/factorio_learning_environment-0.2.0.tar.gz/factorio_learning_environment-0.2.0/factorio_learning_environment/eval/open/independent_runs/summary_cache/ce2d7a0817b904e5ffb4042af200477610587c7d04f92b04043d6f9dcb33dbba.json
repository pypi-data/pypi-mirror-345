{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer Station at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) receiving coal from the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal transferred by the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) set up to transfer items but currently waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Station at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) receiving iron ore from the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to the stone furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) set up to transfer items but currently waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) set up to transfer items but currently waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full inventory.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. If an inserter is waiting for source items, ensure that the supply chain feeding into it is functioning correctly.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n- `wood`: int = 10\n- `iron-ore`: int = 742\n- `iron-plate`: int = 865\n\nThis report provides a detailed overview of the existing structures, error tips, and namespace definitions based on the provided execution logs."}
