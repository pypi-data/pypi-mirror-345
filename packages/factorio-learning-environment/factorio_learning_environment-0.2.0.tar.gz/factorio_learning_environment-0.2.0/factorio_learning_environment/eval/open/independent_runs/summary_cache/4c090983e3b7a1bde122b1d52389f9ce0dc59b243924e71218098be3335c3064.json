{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) supplied with iron ore and refueled with coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from a transport belt to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the furnace and chest, facilitating the movement of materials.\n\n### Iron Ore Supply Chain\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Burner Inserters positioned strategically to move iron ore from chests to the transport belt network.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5) storing iron ore.\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) storing iron ore.\n- Transport Belt network facilitating the movement of iron ore between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions to facilitate material movement:\n  - Belt from (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-46.5) in a downward direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) in an upward direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-43.5) in a downward direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) in a rightward direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5) in a downward direction.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting iron ore into furnaces or chests\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in the inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or chests to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept outputs from inserters to prevent blockage warnings and ensure smooth operation."}
