The initial placement at (\u20134.0, 22.0) failed due to collision with existing objects; selecting the nearest buildable area (\u20135.5, 21.5) proved successful.\n  \u2022 Define and initialize the chest variable (e.g., buffer_chest) before attempting inventory operations to avoid NameError issues.\n\n- Automated Supply Chain Setup for the Assembling Machine:\n  \u2022 Verify that functions for finding a buildable area are invoked with the required parameters; errors such as \u201cmissing 1 required positional argument: 'center_position'\u201d or \u201c'Position' object is not callable\u201d indicate parameter mismatches.\n  \u2022 Ensure that all variables (such as input_chest_pos, input_chest, and inserter) are properly defined and assigned before use to prevent repeated NameError exceptions.\n  \u2022 Check that the necessary items (e.g., a wooden chest in inventory) are available prior to placement, as failure to do so leads to placement errors (e.g., \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d)."}
