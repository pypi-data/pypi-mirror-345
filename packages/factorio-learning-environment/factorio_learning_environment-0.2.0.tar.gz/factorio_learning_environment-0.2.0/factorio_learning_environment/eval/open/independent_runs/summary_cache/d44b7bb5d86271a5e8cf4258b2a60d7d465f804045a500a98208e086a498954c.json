{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and is currently fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores the extracted iron ore, currently containing 455 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It picks up items from position (x=-12.5, y=-48.5) and drops them at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving any iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly set, and that there is a clear path for the items to move.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Always check your inventory to ensure you have enough fuel (coal) before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters. Running out of fuel can halt production processes.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Regularly check your inventory levels to avoid attempting actions that require items you do not possess, such as inserting coal when none is available in your inventory.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Check the inserter setup and ensure that the path from the chest to the furnace is unobstructed and correctly configured."}
