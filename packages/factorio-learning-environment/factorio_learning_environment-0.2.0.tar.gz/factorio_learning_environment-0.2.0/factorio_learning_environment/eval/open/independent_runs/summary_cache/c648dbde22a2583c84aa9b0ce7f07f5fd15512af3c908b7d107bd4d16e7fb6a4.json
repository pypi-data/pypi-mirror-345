{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5) with status WORKING\n- Pipe Groups connecting these components, with notable positions:\n  - Pipe Group at position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT\n  - Pipe Group at position (x=18.5, y=-8.5) and (x=20.5, y=-8.5) with status EMPTY\n- Electricity Group at position (x=24.5, y=-7.5) with status NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, producing copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, producing iron plates\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Lab at unspecified position with status NO_POWER\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5) with status NORMAL\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) with status NO_POWER\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Picking Up Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. Verify the position coordinates to avoid attempting to pick up non-existent pipes.\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Check for existing entities at the target position before placing a new pipe. Remove any existing entities that obstruct the placement of the new pipe.\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to the water source. Verify the pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure water flow.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly connected to both the boiler and the electricity network. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes and ensure the electricity network is properly set up.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that the inserter is connected to a power source. Ensure that the small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to the electricity network."}
