{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (16.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore (currently offline due to power issues)\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron plates (currently idle due to no input)\n- Connected to small electric pole at (16.5, 68.5)\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Operation at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) extracting copper ore (status unknown)\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 73.0) smelting copper plates (currently idle due to no input)\n- **Burner inserter** at (-45.5, 71.5) transferring items (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (15.5, -0.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, -0.5) extracting coal (output blocked by full chest)\n- **Wooden chest** at (15.5, 1.5) full of coal (needs emptying)\n\n#### Power Generation Attempts\n- **Offshore pump** at (-21.5, -2.5) and (-9.5, -2.5) (both NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Boilers** at (-22.0, -4.5), (-17.0, -4.5), (13.0, -4.5), (8.0, -4.5), and (3.0, -4.5) (all NOT_CONNECTED)\n- No successful steam engine placements due to water interference\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent Water Placement Issues\n- Repeated steam engine placement attempts on water tiles (at (-20.0,-4.0), (-15.0,-4.0), (15.0,-5.0), (10.0,-5.0), (5.0,-5.0), (5.0,-4.0))\n  - Solution: Use position validation before placement, move further inland from shorelines\n\n#### Power System Configuration\n- Multiple disconnected offshore pumps and boilers\n  - Solution: Complete full power plant setup (pump\u2192boiler\u2192engine) in one session before moving to next location\n  - Ensure proper spacing (2 tiles horizontal between boiler and engine)\n\n#### Resource Management\n- Steam engine inventory down to 2 units\n  - Solution: Prioritize successful power plant completion before attempting new locations\n  - Consider manual placement for critical components\n\n#### Operational Issues\n- Mining drills remain unpowered despite placement attempts\n  - Solution: Focus on completing one functional power plant before expanding operations\n- Furnaces idle with \"NO_INGREDIENTS\"\n  - Solution: Fix ore supply chain before expanding smelting operations\n\n#### Placement Logic Errors\n- Failed position finding near (-21.5,-2.5)\n  - Solution: Implement better land detection algorithms with larger search radius\n- Nil value error during offshore pump placement\n  - Solution: Validate water positions before placement attempts"}
