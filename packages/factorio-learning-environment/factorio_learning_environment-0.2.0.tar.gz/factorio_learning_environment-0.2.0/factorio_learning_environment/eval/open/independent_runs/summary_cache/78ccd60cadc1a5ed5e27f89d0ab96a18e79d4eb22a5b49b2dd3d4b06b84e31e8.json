{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) with 8 coal as fuel and 5 iron-ore as input.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.5, -50.5) unable to place due to no resources found in the mining area.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to craft or place entities. For example, you need iron plates, iron gear wheels, and stone to create a stone furnace.\n- Ensure you have enough iron-ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. \n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Always move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when harvesting resources\n- Make sure you are within reach of the resource you want to harvest. If nothing is within reach, you will not be able to harvest.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace or any other entity. If you do not have the required items, the insertion will fail.\n\n### Smelting timeout errors\n- Check that you have enough fuel and input materials for the smelting process. If the furnace times out, it indicates that it cannot proceed due to insufficient resources. \n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure you have enough iron plates in your inventory to craft required sub-ingredients like iron gear wheels. If you lack the necessary components, crafting will fail.\n\n### Errors when inserting iron ore into the furnace\n- Ensure you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. If you do not have iron ore, the insertion will fail.\n\n### Errors when extracting iron ore\n- Ensure that there is a valid entity containing iron ore at the specified position before attempting to extract it. If no valid entity is found, the extraction will fail.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient iron plates\n- Ensure you have enough iron ore available to produce the required iron plates. If not enough plates are produced, it may hinder further crafting processes.\n\n### Errors when placing burner mining drill\n- Ensure that there are resources available in the mining area before attempting to place a burner mining drill. If no resources are found, the placement will fail."}
