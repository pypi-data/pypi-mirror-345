{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-6.5, -48.5) storing smelted iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items between entities.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-6.5, -47.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the chest to another location.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that all entities referenced in code are correctly defined and exist on the map. For example, the error \"Could not find entity at x=-11.5 y=-44.5: name 'Chest' is not defined\" suggests that the entity was referenced before being created.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Check the inventory capacity before attempting to insert items. The error \"Could not insert: Failed to insert iron-plate into stone-furnace at position {x = -10, y = -48. Attempted to insert 50 items. Inventory is full\" indicates that the target inventory was full.\n\n### Errors with Local Variables\n- Ensure that all local variables are initialized before being accessed. The error \"UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'x' where it is not associated with a value\" suggests that a variable was used before being assigned a value.\n\n### Errors with Resource Availability\n- Verify that resources are available before attempting to transfer them. The message \"No iron ore available in ore chest for transfer\" indicates that the source container was empty.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items to avoid them waiting indefinitely. The message \"Inserter at x=-11.5 y=-45.5 is waiting for source items\" suggests that the inserter is not receiving the intended items."}
