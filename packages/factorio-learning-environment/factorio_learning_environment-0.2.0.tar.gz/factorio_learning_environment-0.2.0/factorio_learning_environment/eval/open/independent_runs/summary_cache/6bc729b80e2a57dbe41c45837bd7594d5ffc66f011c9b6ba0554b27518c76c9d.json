{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Boiler at position(-34.5, 30.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -34.5, 30.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Pipe group (position -36.5, 29.5) connected to the boiler\n\n### Steam Engine at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Small electric poles (multiple positions around -29.5, 30.5) that are not connected to a power network\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5) with status WORKING\n- Pipe group (position -10.5, 23.5) connected to the offshore pump\n\n### Lab at position(-23.5, 29.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position -23.5, 29.5) with status NO_POWER\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- Pipe group (position -24.5, -51.5) with status EMPTY\n- Pipe group (position -10.5, 23.5) with fluid system 63084 and status FULL_OUTPUT\n- Pipe group (position -3.5, 24.5) with status EMPTY\n- Pipe group (position -36.5, 28.5) with status EMPTY\n\n### Electricity Group at position(-27.5, -2.5)\nConsists of multiple small electric poles (various positions) with voltage 0.\n\n### Furnaces\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to entity connections\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to a water source and power network to avoid the NOT_CONNECTED status.\n- Check the connections of the offshore pump to ensure it is properly linked to the fluid system.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to entity retrieval\n- Verify the position of the entity you are trying to retrieve. The error indicates that there was an attempt to get an offshore pump at a position where none exists. Always check the map for the correct entity locations before executing commands."}
