{"content": "Thank you for providing the error output. Let's analyze what happened:\n\n1. Successful Actions:\n- Successfully retrieved inventory contents\n- We can see we have materials available: transport belts, coal, stone, iron ore, etc.\n\n2. Errors Encountered:\n- Main error was failing to find a stone furnace at position (-11.0, 22.0)\n- This suggests either:\n  a) The furnace wasn't placed yet\n  b) The coordinates were incorrect\n  c) The furnace might be at a slightly different position\n\n3. Lessons Learned:\n- Always verify entity existence before trying to interact with it\n- Need to be more precise with coordinates\n- Should implement better error handling\n\n4. Recommendations for Future Interactions:\n\n```python\n# Better pattern for entity verification:\ndef find_nearby_entity(entity_type, approximate_position, search_radius=2):\n    for x in range(int(approximate_position.x - search_radius), int(approximate_position.x + search_radius + 1)):\n        for y in range(int(approximate_position.y - search_radius), int(approximate_position.y + search_radius + 1)):\n            try:\n                entity = get_entity(entity_type, Position(x=float(x), y=float(y)))\n                if entity:\n                    return entity\n            except Exception:\n                continue\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\ntarget_position = Position(x=-11.0, y=22.0)\nfurnace = find_nearby_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, target_position)\nif furnace:\n    print(f\"Found furnace at {furnace.position}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No furnace found in the area\")\n```\n\n5. Improved Error Handling Pattern:\n\n```python\ndef safe_entity_operation(entity_type, position, operation_func):\n    try:\n        entity = get_entity(entity_type, position)\n        if entity:\n            return operation_func(entity)\n        else:\n            print(f\"No {entity_type} found at {position}\")\n            return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error handling {entity_type} at {position}: {str(e)}\")\n        return None\n```\n\n6. Tips for Future API Interactions:\n- Always verify entity existence before operations\n- Use try-except blocks for entity interactions\n- Implement position verification before placement\n- Keep track of placed entity positions\n- Use relative positioning rather than absolute when possible\n- Implement logging for debugging\n- Build verification steps into automation sequences\n\n7. Successful Patterns:\n```python\n# Pattern for safe entity placement\ndef safe_place_entity(entity_type, position):\n    try:\n        # Check if position is clear\n        existing = get_entity(entity_type, position)\n        if existing:\n            print(f\"Position {position} already occupied\")\n            return existing\n        \n        # Verify we have the item in inventory\n        inventory = inspect_inventory()\n        item_name = entity_type.value\n        if inventory.get(item_name, 0) > 0:\n            place_entity(entity_type, position)\n            return get_entity(entity_type, position)\n        else:\n            print(f\"No {item_name} in inventory\")\n            return None\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error placing {entity_type} at {position}: {str(e)}\")\n        return None\n```\n\n8. Next Steps:\n- Implement position verification before operations\n- Create a system to track placed entities\n- Implement better error recovery mechanisms\n- Create helper functions for common operations\n- Build a more robust automation sequence with verification steps\n\nThis analysis shows we need to be more careful with entity positioning and verification, and implement better error handling in our automation sequences. The provided patterns should help make future interactions more robust and reliable.", "summary_range": "[1-1026]"}
