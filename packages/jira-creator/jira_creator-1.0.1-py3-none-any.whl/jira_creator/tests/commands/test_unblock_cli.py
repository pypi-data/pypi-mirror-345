"""
This file contains unit tests for the 'unblock' command of a CLI tool.
It includes two test functions:
- test_unblock_command_success: tests the successful execution of the 'unblock' command.
- test_unblock_command_failure: tests the failure scenario of the 'unblock' command when an UnBlockError is raised.

The tests use MagicMock and pytest to mock and assert the behavior of the CLI tool when unblocking an issue.
