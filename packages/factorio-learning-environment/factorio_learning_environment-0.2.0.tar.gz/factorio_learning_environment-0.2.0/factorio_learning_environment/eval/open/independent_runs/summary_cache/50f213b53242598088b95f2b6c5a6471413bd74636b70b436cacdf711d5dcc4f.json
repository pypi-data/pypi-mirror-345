{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is currently not researching anything.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) which is currently not receiving electricity and cannot create automation-science-pack due to missing resources.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=42803, position -18.5, 16.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=42806, position -12.5, 21.5, fluid=water)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=42809, position -9.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=42814, position -10.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=42815, position -6.5, 23.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions you are trying to connect with pipes are valid and reachable. Check for any obstacles or incorrect positioning that may prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. In this case, ensure you have coal available to insert into the boiler.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
