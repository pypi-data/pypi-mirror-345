Check the furnace's inventory or status before extracting.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place a entity to a tile before attempting placing. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n -  Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n\n### Errors related to coal\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a furnace or inserter.\n\n### Errors related to distance when placing entities\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target position when placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles. Move closer to the target location before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors related to missing items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions:\n\nNone\n\n### Variables:\n\n- None\n```"}
