{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map during these steps. Repeated attempts to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed, and no Lab or other crafted building was added. Although existing smelting structures (a furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were referenced for resource processing, no new structure was deployed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2013 API Usage for Entity Retrieval\n  \u2022 Avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments to get_entities. Use the correct parameter structure and verify the function\u2019s expected inputs.\n  \u2022 Check the return value from get_entities before iterating over it to prevent \u201cNoneType\u201d iteration errors.\n\n\u2013 Lab Placement Issues\n  \u2022 Ensure the Lab item is present in the inventory prior to attempting placement. An absence of the item causes placement failures.\n\n\u2013 Lab Crafting Chain Problems\n  \u2022 Verify that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, and copper plates) are available or can be produced with a proper setup before attempting to craft a Lab.\n  \u2022 Confirm that each step in the crafting chain is feasible \u2013 for instance, ensuring that furnaces or crafting machines are available to process items like electronic-circuit sub-ingredients.\n  \u2022 Compare the inventory counts against crafting requirements to avoid shortages (e.g., missing iron-gear-wheel x2) that lead to persistent crafting failures."}
