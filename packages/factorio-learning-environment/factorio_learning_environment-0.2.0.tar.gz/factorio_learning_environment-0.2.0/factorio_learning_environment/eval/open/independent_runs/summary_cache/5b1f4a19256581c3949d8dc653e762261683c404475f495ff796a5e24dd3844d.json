{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) supplying iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore and plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-11.5, -49.5), (-10.5, -49.5), and (-8.5, -49.5) for transferring materials between entities.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) processing coal.\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) for transferring coal and iron plates between entities.\n\n### Storage Area\n- Multiple Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -47.5), (-17.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-15.5, -47.5) for storing iron plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is enough space in the target inventory before attempting to insert items. Avoid attempting to insert items into full chests.\n\n### Resource Redistribution Errors\n- Verify that the source inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to redistribute resources.\n\n### Entity Naming Errors\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly defined and named in the code to avoid errors such as \"name 'Chest' is not defined\".\n\n### Inserter Operation Errors\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items and that their drop positions are not blocked to maintain efficient operation.\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Regularly check furnaces for fuel and input materials to prevent them from stalling due to lack of resources."}
