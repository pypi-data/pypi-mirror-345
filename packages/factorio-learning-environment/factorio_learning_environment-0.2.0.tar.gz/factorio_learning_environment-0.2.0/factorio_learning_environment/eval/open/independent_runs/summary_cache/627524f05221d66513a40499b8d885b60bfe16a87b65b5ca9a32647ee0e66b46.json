{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel inventory containing 50 units of coal. The furnace has warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\". It has produced 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Group at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipes connecting various points: (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5). The pipe group is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric poles at various positions: (x=-1.5, y=20.5), (x=-0.5, y=21.5), (x=-1.5, y=21.5), ..., (x=0.5, y=16.5), (x=-8.5, y=18.5), (x=-8.5, y=19.5). The voltage is currently 0, indicating no power is being transmitted.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure the selected position for placing an offshore pump is suitable and adjacent to a water source. Repeated errors indicate the chosen positions were not valid for pump placement.\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Placement\n- Verify that the placement positions for boilers and steam engines are suitable and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features.\n\n### Connection Errors between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and boiler. Misalignment or incorrect pipe placement can prevent successful connections.\n\n### Electric Pole Connection Issues\n- Check that electric poles are placed within the correct range to connect with each other and ensure there are no obstructions preventing connections.\n\n### Errors in Entity Manipulation\n- When picking up entities, ensure the correct argument types are used. For example, when specifying positions, use Position objects rather than strings.\n\n### Movement Command Errors\n- When issuing movement commands, ensure that the arguments are of the correct type. For example, string indices should be integers, not strings, to avoid movement command errors."}
