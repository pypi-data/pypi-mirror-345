{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron ore from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-12.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. Consider repositioning or removing existing entities if necessary.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place them in the game world.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. Ensure the distance is within the maximum allowable range.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from a position\n- Confirm the presence of the entity type at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Adjust the position or verify the entity type if necessary.\n\n### Misalignment of entities\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly aligned and positioned to facilitate the intended operations, such as transferring items between entities. Adjust positions if misalignments are detected."}
