{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with a status of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with a status of \"furnace result is full\".\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-13.5, y=-47.5), (x=-14.5, y=-45.5), and (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) managing the input and output of materials.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-44.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Transport Belts** connecting the furnaces and chests, facilitating material movement.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-7.0, y=23.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5).\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5).\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5).\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the boiler and offshore pump.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- **Belt Group** connecting various entities, including positions from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities connected to inserters have available items to transfer. Check the inventory of source entities like furnaces and chests.\n\n### Inserter Blocked by Items on the Ground\n- Clear any items blocking the inserter's output path to ensure smooth operation. Ensure there is a sink entity to accept the output.\n\n### Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and replenish the fuel in inserters and boilers to prevent operation halts.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials like iron ore to maintain production.\n\n### Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly extract processed items from furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Attempt to Insert Non-existent Items\n- Verify inventory before attempting to insert items into entities to prevent errors related to non-existent items."}
