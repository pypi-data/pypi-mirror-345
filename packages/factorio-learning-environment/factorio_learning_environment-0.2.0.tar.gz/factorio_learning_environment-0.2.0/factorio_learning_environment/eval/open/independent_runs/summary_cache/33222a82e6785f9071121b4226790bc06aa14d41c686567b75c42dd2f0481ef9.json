{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-4.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups carrying water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting various parts of the factory\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production at (8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at (8.5, 13.5)\n- Input chest for iron gears at (9.5, 10.5)\n- Input chest for copper plates at (11.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear inserter at (8.5, 11.5) facing right\n- Copper plate inserter at (12.5, 13.5) facing left\n- Stone furnace at (14.0, 14.0)\n- Transport belt system with 11 belts\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at various locations:\n1. Setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n2. Setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\n3. Setup at (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - multiple attempts to place chests and inserters where other entities already exist\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and direction to avoid collisions\n- Consider the full dimensions of larger entities (like assembling machines and furnaces) when placing adjacent structures\n\n### Resource Extraction Issues\n- Verify that the target entity contains the desired resource before attempting extraction\n- Ensure furnaces are operational and contain the correct materials before attempting to extract products\n\n### Power and Fuel Management\n- Keep boilers fueled to maintain power generation\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills and inserters to prevent work stoppage\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- Plan the layout of production facilities carefully to ensure proper spacing and connections\n- Consider the direction of inserters and their pickup/drop positions when setting up automation\n- Ensure proper alignment of belts, inserters and machines in production chains"}
