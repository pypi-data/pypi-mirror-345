The agent repeatedly failed to find a suitable position for the offshore pump.\n\n### Errors in Boiler Placement\n- Verify that the position for placing the boiler is suitable and free of obstructions. The agent attempted to place a boiler at an unsuitable position multiple times.\n\n### Errors with Object Methods\n- Avoid calling objects as if they were functions. The agent encountered an error with the message \"Failed to place boiler: 'Position' object is not callable,\" indicating misuse of the Position object."}
