{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is intended to generate electricity using steam produced by the boiler, which requires water supplied by the offshore pump.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipes connecting the boiler and offshore pump. The pipes are located at the following positions:\n- Pipe (position -13.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe (position -12.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe (position -11.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe (position -10.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe (position -9.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe (position -13.5, 16.5)\n- Pipe (position -9.5, 16.5)\n- Pipe (position -13.5, 21.5)\n- Pipe (position -13.5, 20.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n  \n### Copper plate factory at position(5, 5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Lab at position(5, 5)\nConsists of a lab (position 5, 5) for research activities.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect boiler to offshore pump\n- Ensure that the positions of the boiler and offshore pump are correctly aligned and that there are no obstructing entities or pipes in between. Check the coordinates and ensure that the connection points are valid for fluid transfer.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
