{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=61.0, y=-54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=62.5, y=-53.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=62.5, y=-52.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for transferring coal from the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for storing coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Coal in Inventory\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to insert it into any entity. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### NameError: Undefined Variable 'burner_inserter'\n- Verify that all variables are correctly defined before use. Ensure that the variable names match those defined in the code. Consider using auto-complete features or referencing a list of defined variables to avoid such errors.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n- Important Variables:\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Type - `Inventory`, used to track the contents of the stone furnace.\n  - `burner_inserter`: Type - `BurnerInserter`, used for transferring coal from the mining drill.\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Type - `BurnerMiningDrill`, used for extracting coal.\n  - `wooden_chest`: Type - `Chest`, used for storing extracted resources."}
