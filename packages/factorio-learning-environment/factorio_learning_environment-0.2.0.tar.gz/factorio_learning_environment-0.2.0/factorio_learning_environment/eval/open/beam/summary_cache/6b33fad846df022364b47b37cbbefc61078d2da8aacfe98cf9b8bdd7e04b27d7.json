{"content": "The consistent output of only the initial print statement, \"Starting additional detailed diagnostic procedure...\", suggests that the script is encountering an issue early in its execution, likely before or during the retrieval of entities. Here are some steps and suggestions to help diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Entity Retrieval**: Ensure that the `get_entities` function is correctly implemented and that the entities are available in the game world. If the entities are not being retrieved, the script will not progress further.\n\n2. **Add More Debugging Statements**: Place additional print statements immediately after each `get_entities` call to confirm whether entities are being retrieved. This will help identify which specific entity retrieval is failing.\n\n3. **Check for Exceptions**: Ensure that any exceptions are being caught and printed. If an exception occurs before the print statements, it might not be visible. Double-check the exception handling block to ensure it captures and prints any errors.\n\n4. **Test Environment Setup**: Verify that your Factorio environment is set up correctly and that all entities are placed and accessible. If the environment is not configured correctly, the entities might not be found.\n\n5. **Simplify the Script**: Temporarily simplify the script to focus on retrieving just one type of entity and printing it. This can help isolate the problem.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the script with additional debugging statements:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting additional detailed diagnostic procedure...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Attempt to retrieve just one type of entity for debugging\n    print(\"Attempting to retrieve Offshore Pumps...\")\n    offshore_pumps = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    print(f\"Retrieved Offshore Pumps: {offshore_pumps}\")\n\n    # Check if any Offshore Pumps were found\n    if not offshore_pumps:\n        raise AssertionError(\"No Offshore Pumps found!\")\n\n    print(\"Offshore Pumps are present.\")\n\n    # Proceed with further logic if needed\n    # ...\n\nexcept AssertionError as ae:\n    print(f\"Assertion Error - Missing Entities: {ae}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Unexpected Error Occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nBy focusing on one type of entity and adding print statements, you can determine if the issue lies with the entity retrieval process or elsewhere in the script. Once you identify the problem, you can gradually reintroduce the rest of the logic.", "summary_range": "[1-330]"}
