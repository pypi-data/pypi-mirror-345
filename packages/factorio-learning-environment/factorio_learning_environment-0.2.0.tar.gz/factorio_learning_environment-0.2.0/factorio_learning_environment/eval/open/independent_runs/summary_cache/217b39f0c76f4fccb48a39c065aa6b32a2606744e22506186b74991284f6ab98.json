{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and an output blocked by an item on the ground. The drill is operational and extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace currently has no ingredients to smelt and is not producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place entities such as Transport Belts, Burner Inserters, and Wooden Chests. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that the output of the Burner Mining Drill is clear of items on the ground and that there is a sink entity, such as a furnace or chest, to accept the output.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors related to missing entities, such as the stone furnace not being found at a given position."}
