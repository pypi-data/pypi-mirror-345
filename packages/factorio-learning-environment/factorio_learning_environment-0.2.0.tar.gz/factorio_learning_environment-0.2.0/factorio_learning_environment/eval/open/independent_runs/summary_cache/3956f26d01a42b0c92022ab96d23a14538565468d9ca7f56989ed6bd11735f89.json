{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and is fueled by coal. It is currently working and has 3 units of coal as fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore, currently containing 494 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is fueled by coal and currently has 4 units of coal as fuel. It is waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled by coal but is currently not receiving iron ore due to incorrect inserter setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. The inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) has been repositioned multiple times but still fails to transfer iron ore to the furnace. Verify the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly set.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Always check your inventory for available fuel before attempting to refuel entities. An error occurred when trying to insert coal into an inserter without having coal in the inventory. Ensure you have sufficient coal before refueling operations.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- The stone furnace is not receiving iron ore due to the misalignment of the inserter. Double-check the inserter's configuration to ensure it can pick up iron ore from the chest and deliver it to the furnace.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly monitor your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for construction and refueling tasks. Keep track of your coal and iron ore levels to avoid interruptions in production."}
