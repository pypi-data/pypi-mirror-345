{"content": "\"\"\"\nIt seems that the function `ensure_craftable` is not defined in the current context, which is causing the error when we attempt to check if we can craft the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Current Inventory:\n- 1 stone furnace (available)\n- 3 wood (remaining)\n- 5 stone (gathered)\n- 10 iron plates (produced)\n- 1 iron gear wheel\n\n### Analysis\nSince we cannot use the `ensure_craftable` function, we need to manually check if we have the necessary resources to craft the Burner Mining Drill. The requirements are:\n- 5 iron plates\n- 1 iron gear wheel\n\nGiven our inventory, we have enough resources to craft the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Next Steps\nLet's proceed to craft the Burner Mining Drill directly without the helper function, and then we can use it to gather more resources.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Directly craft the Burner Mining Drill since we have the required resources\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, quantity=1)  # Crafting one burner mining drill\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting Burner Mining Drill: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory after crafting the drill", "summary_range": "[1-198]"}
