{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Steam Power Generation near x=-6.5 y=0.5\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   OffshorePump at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) extracting water.\n*   Boiler at position (x=-3.0, y=0.5) consuming coal to produce steam.\n*   Steam Engine at position (x=-6.5, y=3.5) intended to consume steam to produce electricity.\n*   PipeGroup connecting the OffshorePump to the Boiler (fluid: water). Example pipe at (x=-8.5, y=-0.5).\n*   PipeGroup connecting the Boiler to the Steam Engine (fluid: steam). Example pipe at (x=-2.5, y=4.5). *Note: The connection between Boiler and Steam Engine failed during the last attempt in Step 31.*\n\n### Coal Mine at x=16.0 y=0.0\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   BurnerMiningDrill at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) mining Coal.\n*   WoodenChest at position (x=16.5, y=1.5) receiving Coal from the BurnerMiningDrill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n*   Ensure you check if a tile is valid for placement before attempting to place an entity. Use functions like `can_place_entity` (with correct arguments) or `nearest_buildable` to find suitable locations, especially if direct placement fails. Avoid placing entities in locations occupied by other objects or invalid terrain.\n\n### Incorrect API Usage\n*   "}
