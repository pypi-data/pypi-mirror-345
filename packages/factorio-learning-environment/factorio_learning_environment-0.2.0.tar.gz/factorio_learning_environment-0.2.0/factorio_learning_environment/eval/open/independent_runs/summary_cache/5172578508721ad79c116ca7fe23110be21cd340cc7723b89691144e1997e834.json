{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at Position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=52.0, y=-79.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=53.5, y=-79.5) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=54.5, y=-79.5) (contains iron plates)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) (empty)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-12.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Storage Area at Position(x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=0.5) (contains coal and iron ore)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=5.5, y=0.5) (contains iron ore, plates, and gear wheels)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining Drill Not Working\n- **Error**: The mining drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) is not working due to lack of fuel and a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Tip**: Ensure the mining drill has sufficient fuel and that the chest at the drop position is not full. Empty the chest or add more storage capacity to allow the drill to continue mining.\n\n#### Burner Inserters Out of Fuel\n- **Error**: Multiple burner inserters (e.g., at positions (x=53.5, y=-79.5) and (x=55.5, y=-78.5)) are out of fuel.\n- **Tip**: Ensure all burner inserters are fueled with coal or other burnable items to keep them operational.\n\n#### Furnace No Ingredients\n- **Error**: The stone furnace at position (x=52.0, y=-79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Tip**: Ensure the furnace is supplied with iron ore and fuel (coal) to start smelting iron plates.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- **Error**: The burner inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-80.5) is waiting for source items.\n- **Tip**: Ensure the inserter has access to items to pick up and transfer. Check the source chest for available items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **None defined yet**\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **None assigned yet**"}
