{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) supplying coal to the Iron Furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) used for intermediate storage.\n- Transport Belt connecting the chest and the furnace, facilitating the movement of items.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Copper Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, currently working with copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) supplying coal to the Copper Furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) used for intermediate storage.\n- Transport Belt connecting the chest and the furnace, facilitating the movement of items.\n\n### Coal Extraction and Distribution\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Transport Belt at position (40.5, -83.5) moving coal from the drill to the chest.\n\n### General Transport and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Burner Inserters at various positions (3.5, 0.5), (6.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5) moving items between chests and belts.\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities for item transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inspect_inventory on transport belts\n- Ensure that the transport belt at the specified position contains the items you intend to inspect. Verify the belt's contents before attempting to inspect.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from transport belts\n- Confirm that the transport belt at the specified position contains the items you intend to extract. Check for the presence of the desired item before extraction.\n\n### Errors when getting entities at specified positions\n- Verify that an entity of the expected type exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. This will prevent errors related to missing entities.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter is not empty. Regularly check and replenish the source items to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### AttributeError when inspecting inventory\n- When using positions to inspect inventories, ensure that the position object is correctly defined and has the necessary attributes for the operation."}
