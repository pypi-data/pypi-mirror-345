Gather more iron ore to restart the first furnace and maximize production.\n2. Continue monitoring the second furnace as it processes its remaining iron ore.\n3. After the second furnace completes its operation, we can evaluate our total iron plate production and consider crafting new entities.\n\nLet's proceed to gather more iron ore from the nearest resource patch. We will aim for another 10 iron ore to keep our furnaces running.\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1. Find the nearest iron ore position again\niron_ore_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\n\n# 2.
