{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nThis facility is designed for the production of iron plates and consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chests to the furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) for storing the produced iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nThis system is responsible for managing the storage and transfer of iron ore:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which moves iron ore from the storage chest to the furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\nThis system facilitates the transfer of iron plates:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) which transfers iron plates from the furnaces to a storage chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing transferred iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not full, or provide additional storage space to accommodate the items being transferred.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Mining Drill and Furnace Low on Fuel\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining drills and furnaces and refuel them promptly to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Errors in Item Insertion Due to Inventory Shortage\n- Before attempting to insert items, verify that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid operation failures.\n\n### UnboundLocalError and ValueError in Code Execution\n- Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and associated with values before use.\n- When using functions that require specific object types, ensure the correct object type is passed to avoid errors.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source for the inserter has items available for transfer to prevent idle time."}
