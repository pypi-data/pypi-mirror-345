{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) which is currently working and has a fuel inventory containing coal and a furnace source containing copper-ore.\n\n### Wooden chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 1.5) with an inventory containing iron-plate (50).\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 3.5) with an inventory containing iron-plate (50).\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 5.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting copper-ore from the furnace\n- Ensure that the stone furnace at (1.0, 1.0) contains copper-ore before attempting to extract it. If there is no copper-ore present, the extraction will fail.\n\n### Errors when inserting copper-ore into the furnace\n- Confirm that the furnace is operational and has the capacity to accept more copper-ore before inserting items.\n\n### Errors when crafting Automation Science Packs\n- Ensure that there are enough copper plates available in the furnace to craft Automation Science Packs. If the furnace copper plate count is zero, you cannot proceed with crafting.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
