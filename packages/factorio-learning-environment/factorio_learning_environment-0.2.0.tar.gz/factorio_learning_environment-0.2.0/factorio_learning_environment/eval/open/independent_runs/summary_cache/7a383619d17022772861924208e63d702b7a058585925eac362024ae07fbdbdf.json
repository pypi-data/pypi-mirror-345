{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) - Extracts iron ore\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 74.0) - Smelts iron ore into plates\n- **Burner inserter** at (16.5, 75.5) - Transfers plates from furnace to chest\n- **Wooden chest** at (17.5, 75.5) - Stores smelted iron plates\n\n### Power Generation Setup\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Pumps water\n- **Boiler** at (-6.0, -0.5) - Heats water into steam using coal\n- **Steam engine** at (-0.5, -0.5) - Generates electricity from steam\n- Connected pipe network between pump, boiler and engine\n- Power network connected to iron mining drill\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement distance errors\n- Move closer to target position before placing entities (max placement distance is 10 tiles)\n- This occurred when trying to place mining drills and chests from too far away\n\n### Entity collision errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- This occurred when trying to place a chest where an inserter already existed\n\n### Connection errors\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces - use inserters as intermediaries\n- This occurred when trying to connect furnace output directly to belt\n\n### Undefined variable errors\n- Ensure all referenced variables are properly defined before use\n- This occurred when trying to connect power to undefined copper_drill and referencing undefined steam_engine\n\n### Power system warnings\n- The iron mining drill shows \"output blocked\" warning - needs output connection\n- The furnace shows \"no ingredients\" warning - needs ore input"}
