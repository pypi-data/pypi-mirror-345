{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- A series of Burner Inserters at positions (52.5, -79.5), (53.5, -78.5), and (55.5, -78.5) facilitating the movement of coal between chests at positions (52.5, -78.5) and (54.5, -78.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting System at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-11.5, -48.5), (-9.5, -48.5), (-8.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -46.5) for moving items between chests and the furnace.\n\n### Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) storing various resources such as iron ore, wood, and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities feeding into the inserters have sufficient items to be transferred. This can be achieved by checking the inventory levels of the source entities and replenishing them as necessary.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are at risk of becoming full to prevent interruptions in mining operations. Specifically, the chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) needs to be monitored and emptied to allow continuous mining.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like wooden chests, burner inserters, wood, coal, iron ore, and iron plates."}
