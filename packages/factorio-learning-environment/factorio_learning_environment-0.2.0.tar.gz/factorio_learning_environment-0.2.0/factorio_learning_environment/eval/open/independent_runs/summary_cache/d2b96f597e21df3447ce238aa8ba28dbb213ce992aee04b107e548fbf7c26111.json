{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) which is working.\n- Steam engine at position (-13.5, 23.5) which is not connected.\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) which is not connected.\n- Pipe groups at various positions, including:\n  - Pipe group at position (-9.5, 23.5) with status EMPTY and FULL OUTPUT.\n  - Pipe group at position (-9.5, 22.5) with status FULL OUTPUT.\n  - Pipe groups at positions (-5.5, 16.5), (-7.5, 24.5), (-5.5, 24.5), (-4.5, 16.5), and (-4.5, 24.5) with status EMPTY.\n- Electricity group at position (-3.67, 20.21) which is not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with status NO INGREDIENTS.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object obstructing the placement of pipes. Check the target location before attempting to place a pipe-to-ground.\n- Verify that there is sufficient inventory of pipes before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Check the connectivity between pipe-to-ground entities to ensure they are properly aligned and within connection range. Ensure both ends of the underground pipe are correctly positioned.\n\n### Errors with Position Object\n- Avoid using 'Position' as a callable object. Ensure that positions are correctly specified as coordinates without invoking them as functions.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Network\n- Ensure that all electricity-related entities are properly connected to the electric network to avoid NOT PLUGGED IN ELECTRIC NETWORK status.\n\n### Errors with Stone Furnace\n- Provide the necessary ingredients to the stone furnace to avoid NO INGREDIENTS status. Check inventory and supply the required materials."}
