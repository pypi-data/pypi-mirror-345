{"content": "The error indicates that I am trying to craft Iron Gear Wheels, but the required Iron Plates need to be produced using a specific crafting or smelting machine, which is the Stone Furnace in this case. It seems that I need to ensure that the Iron Plates are available in the inventory before attempting to craft the Iron Gear Wheels.\n\nHere's how I will proceed:\n\n1. **Check the Inventory**: I will check the inventory of the Stone Furnace to see how many Iron Plates have been produced.\n2. **Wait for Plates**: If there are not enough Iron Plates available, I will wait until they are produced.\n3. **Extract Plates**: Once I have enough Iron Plates, I will extract them from the Stone Furnace.\n4. **Craft Iron Gear Wheels**: After extracting the Iron Plates, I will proceed to craft the Iron Gear Wheels.\n\nLet's implement these steps:\n\n```python\n# Check the inventory of the Stone Furnace for the number of Iron Plates produced.\ncurrent_iron_plates = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)[Prototype.IronPlate]\n\n# Wait if there are not enough Iron Plates to craft the required number of Iron Gear Wheels.\nwhile current_iron_plates < 3:\n    # Wait while checking the available plates, with a maximum timeout\n    for _ in range(30):  # Wait for a maximum of 30 seconds\n        current_iron_plates = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)[Prototype.IronPlate]\n        if current_iron_plates >= 3:  # Need at least 3 plates\n            break\n        sleep(1)\n    else:\n        raise Exception(\"Furnace timeout - check fuel and inputs for iron plates.\")\n\n# Now that I have enough Iron Plates, I can proceed to collect them.\n# Remove a maximum of 3 Iron Plates\nremove_quantity = min(3, current_iron_plates)\n\n# Extract the Iron Plates from the furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace_entity.position, quantity=remove_quantity)\n\n# Now craft the Iron Gear Wheels\nfor _ in range(2):  # I need 2 Iron Gear Wheels\n    craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel)\n\n# Verify if the crafting of Iron Gear Wheels was successful\nassert inspect_inventory()[Prototype.IronGearWheel] >= 2, \"Failed to craft 2 Iron Gear Wheels.\"\n\n# Now craft the Burner Mining Drill\ndrill_quantity = craft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\n\n# Verify if the crafting was successful\nassert drill_quantity == 1, f\"Expected to craft 1 Burner Mining Drill, but crafted {drill_quantity}\"\n\n# Finally, place the Burner Mining Drill next to the furnace.\ndrill_entity = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, furnace_entity.position, Direction.RIGHT)\n\n# Verify if the drill was placed successfully\nassert drill_entity, \"Failed to place the Burner Mining Drill.\"\n\n# Now, I will collect coal again for the drill.\nharvest_resource(coal_position, quantity=10)  # Harvest some more coal\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill_entity, quantity=5)  # Insert coal into the drill\n\n# Harvest more iron ore if needed and insert it into the furnace\nharvest_resource(iron_ore_position, quantity=10)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace_entity, quantity=10)  # Insert iron ore into the furnace\n\nprint(\"Setup is complete with a functional Burner Mining Drill and Stone Furnace!\")\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that I wait for the Iron Plates to be produced before trying to craft the Iron Gear Wheels. I will also extract the plates from the furnace correctly before proceeding with crafting.", "summary_range": "[1-18]"}
