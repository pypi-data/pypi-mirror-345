{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) for processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) used for storing mined iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) for transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=53.5, y=-80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-78.5) used for storing mined coal.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=52.5, y=-79.5) and (x=52.5, y=-76.5) for transferring coal between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage. This can be done by transferring items to other storage or processing facilities.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that there is a continuous supply of items for inserters to transfer. This can be achieved by ensuring that the upstream processes are not halted and that there is a sufficient supply of raw materials.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wooden-chest`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
