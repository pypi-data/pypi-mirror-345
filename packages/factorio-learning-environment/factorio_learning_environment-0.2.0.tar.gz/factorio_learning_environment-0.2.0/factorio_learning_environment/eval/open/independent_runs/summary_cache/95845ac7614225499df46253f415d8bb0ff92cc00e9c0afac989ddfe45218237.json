{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=40.0, y=-84.0) with a drop position at Position(x=40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position(x=40.5, y=-82.5) connected to the mining drill\n- Transport Belt starting at Position(x=41.5, y=-84.5) and extending through Position(x=41.5, y=-83.5) to Position(x=41.5, y=-82.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Coal Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Position(x=50.5, y=-86.5) to Position(x=48.5, y=-86.5) and outputs from Position(x=49.5, y=-86.5) to Position(x=47.5, y=-86.5)\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position(x=56.5, y=-83.5)\n- Iron Chest at Position(x=42.5, y=-80.5) containing coal\n- Burner Inserter at Position(x=41.5, y=-80.5) connected to the iron chest\n\n### Additional Belt Systems\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups and individual belts connecting various positions:\n- BeltGroup from Position(x=54.5, y=-86.5) to Position(x=52.5, y=-86.5) and from Position(x=52.5, y=-82.5) to Position(x=53.5, y=-83.5)\n- BeltGroup from Position(x=42.5, y=-84.5) to Position(x=44.5, y=-84.5)\n- BeltGroup from Position(x=44.5, y=-82.5) to Position(x=42.5, y=-82.5)\n- BeltGroup from Position(x=44.5, y=-83.5) to Position(x=44.5, y=-81.5)\n- BeltGroup from Position(x=47.5, y=-82.5) to Position(x=49.5, y=-82.5)\n- Individual belts connecting various positions\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing chests and inserters\n- Ensure there is a suitable position available for placing chests and inserters. Check for obstructions and clear them before attempting to place these entities.\n\n### Errors when placing chests at mining drill's drop position\n- Avoid placing chests directly at the mining drill's drop position if there is no suitable space. Consider adjusting the layout or clearing obstructions.\n\n### Errors with blocked mining drill output\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, in place to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with inserter operation\n- Check that the destination for inserters is not full and there is space available to deposit items. Adjust the layout or inventory management to avoid inserter blockages."}
