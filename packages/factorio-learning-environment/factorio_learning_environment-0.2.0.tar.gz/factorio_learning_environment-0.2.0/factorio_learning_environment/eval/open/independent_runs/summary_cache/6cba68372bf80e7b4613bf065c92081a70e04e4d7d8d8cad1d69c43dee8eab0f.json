This device is used to lift extracted items into subsequent belt connections.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\nConsists of the following interconnected entities:\n\u2022 Cable Factory Input Chest at (x=2.5, y=17.5) serving as the resource intake.\n\u2022 New Factory Burner Inserter at (x=3.5, y=17.5) using direction RIGHT, which links production to downstream processing.\n\u2003\u2013 Neighbouring components include a burner inserter at (x=2.5, y=16.5) and an assembling machine at (x=1.5, y=19.5).  \nThis structure is intended to process copper plates into copper cables.\n\n### Belt Depot System at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\nConsists of the following entities forming an intermediary belt connection:\n\u2022 Wooden Chest (belt depot) placed at (x=3.5, y=15.5) acting as a fixed belt target.\n\u2022 Transport Belt Segment at (x=4.5, y=15.5) positioned adjacent to the depot chest to extend belt routing.\n\u2022 Depot Burner Inserter at (x=3.5, y=14.5) using direction UP with a pickup position at (x=3.5, y=15.5) and drop position at (x=3.5, y=13.5).  \nIts purpose is to serve as a defined connection node for transferring items between extraction and factory stages.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 When connecting transport belts, ensure the target is a valid inserter or similar input device. Avoid selecting objects (e.g. Prototype.SteamEngine) that cannot accept items to prevent connection failures.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the player is within the allowed distance of the target placement. Moving closer before attempting placement avoids errors due to exceeding the maximum range.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Availability Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required item exists in the inventory prior to placement. Missing items (such as a wooden chest) will result in placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Variable Definition Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Check that all variables are correctly defined and referenced. Typos or undefined variables (for example, using \u201ctarget_chest\u201d without prior definition) lead to runtime NameErrors."}
