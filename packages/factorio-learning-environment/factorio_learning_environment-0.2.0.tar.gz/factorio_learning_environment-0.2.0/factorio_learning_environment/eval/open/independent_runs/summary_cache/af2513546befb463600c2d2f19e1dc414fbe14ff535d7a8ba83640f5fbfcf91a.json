It consists of multiple parallel mining and smelting lines.\n- **Mining Section:**\n    - Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=16.0, y=71.0) outputting to Wooden Chest at Position(x=16.5, y=72.5).\n    - Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=18.0, y=71.0) outputting to Wooden Chest at Position(x=18.5, y=72.5).\n    - Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=20.0, y=71.0) outputting to Wooden Chest at Position(x=20.5, y=72.5).\n    - Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=22.0, y=71.0) outputting to Wooden Chest at Position(x=22.5, y=72.5).\n    - Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=24.0, y=71.0) outputting to Wooden Chest at Position(x=24.5, y=72"}
