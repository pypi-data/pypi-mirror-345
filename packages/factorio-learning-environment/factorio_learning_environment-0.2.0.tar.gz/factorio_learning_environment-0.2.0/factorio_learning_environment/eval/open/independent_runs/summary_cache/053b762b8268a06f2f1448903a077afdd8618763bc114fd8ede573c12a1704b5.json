{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnaces at positions:\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Chests for storage:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-10.5, y=-50.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden chests at positions (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5), (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) for additional iron plate storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) fueled by coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Storage chests:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) for iron ore storage.\n  - Wooden chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5) for iron plate storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting into full inventory\n- Ensure that the target chest has enough space before attempting to insert items. Check the inventory capacity and current load to prevent overfilling.\n\n### Errors with furnace operation\n- Monitor the furnace status and ensure there are ingredients to smelt. If the furnace result inventory is full, clear out the output to allow continued operation.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to maintain continuous production and prevent resource overflow.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Container, quantity: int)`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target container. Ensure the container has sufficient space to avoid insertion errors.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `empty_chest`: Represents a chest intended for receiving items.\n  - `items_to_transfer`: Integer representing the quantity of items to be transferred between entities."}
