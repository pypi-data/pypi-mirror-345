{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### No structures have been identified\nBased on the provided logs, there is no information about any existing structures on the map. The logs primarily consist of error messages and inventory details without any mention of constructed entities or their positions. \n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### No source entity found for inserters\n- Ensure that inserters have a valid source entity from which to extract items. Check for missing belts or full chests that might be preventing the inserter from functioning correctly. This issue was observed at multiple locations:\n  - Inserter at x=42.5 y=-83.5\n  - Inserter at x=61.5 y=-59.5\n  - Inserter at x=62.5 y=-58.5\n  - Inserter at x=61.5 y=-57.5\n  - Inserter at x=61.5 y=-55.5\n  - Inserter at x=62.5 y=-52.5\n  - Inserter at x=61.5 y=-51.5\n\n### Unable to place transport belt\n- Investigate the area where the placement of transport belts is failing. Ensure that the target tiles are not occupied by other entities or blocked by obstacles. This issue was observed at:\n  - x=109.5 y=-130.5\n  - x=110.5 y=-130.5\n  - x=111.5 y=-130.5\n\n### Extraction failures\n- Extraction attempts failed at various locations. Ensure that the agent is close enough to the target entity and that the entity is not empty or inaccessible. This issue was observed at numerous locations, including but not limited to:\n  - x=38.5 y=-84.5\n  - x=39.5 y=-84.5\n  - x=40.5 y=-84.5\n  - x=41.5 y=-84.5\n  - x=42.5 y=-84.5\n  - x=43.5 y=-84.5\n  - x=44.5 y=-84.5\n  - x=45.5 y=-85.5\n  - x=40.5 y=-83.5\n  - x=44.5 y=-83.5\n  - x=61.5 y=-60.5\n  - x=62.5 y=-60.5\n  - x=62.5 y=-53.5\n  - x=61.5 y=-50.5\n  - x=62.5 y=-50.5\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: A dictionary containing the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
