{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 8), currently smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) feeding the furnace, waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) connected to the burner inserter.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) moving items from the wooden chest to a transport belt, waiting for source items.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), facilitating item transport.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) moving items from the belt to another wooden chest, waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 9), currently smelting copper ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (8.5, 0.5) feeding copper ore into the furnace, waiting for space in destination.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (11.5, 0.5) extracting copper plates from the furnace and placing them into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or use them. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace or burner inserter without having them in inventory will result in errors.\n\n### Errors when Using Undefined Variables\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined before use. For instance, using `output_inserter` without defining it leads to a `NameError`.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities at Incorrect Positions\n- Ensure you are within the maximum allowable distance when placing entities. Moving closer to the target position can resolve placement errors due to distance constraints.\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Non-Existent Entities\n- Verify the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting to extract items. Ensure that the entity contains the desired items to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when Inspecting Non-Existent Inventory\n- Confirm that the entity you are inspecting exists and is correctly referenced to avoid inspection errors."}
