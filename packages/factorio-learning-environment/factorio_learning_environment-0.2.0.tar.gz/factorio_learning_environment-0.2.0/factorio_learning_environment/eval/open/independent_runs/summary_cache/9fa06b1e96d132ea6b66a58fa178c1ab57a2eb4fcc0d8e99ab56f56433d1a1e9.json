{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (0.5, -1.5) connected to the stone furnaces\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, -1.5) connected to the stone furnaces\n\nThe facility is currently set up to smelt iron ore into iron plates using stone furnaces. The burner inserters are positioned to facilitate the movement of materials between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required materials\n- Verify that you have all necessary materials before crafting items. For instance, crafting a burner inserter requires iron plates, which need to be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target position is not already occupied by another object. Adjust the position or direction if necessary to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors when crafting items with unavailable recipes\n- Some items, like wood, must be gathered as raw resources and cannot be crafted. Ensure you gather these resources directly from the environment."}
