{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-6.0, 1.5)\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 4.5)\n- Connected with pipes at (-8.5, -0.5), (-6.5, -0.5), (-7.5, -0.5), (-4.5, 1.5), (-4.5, 2.5), (-4.5, 3.5), (-4.5, 4.5)\n\n### Iron Production Facility at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (16.0, 74.0) smelting iron plates\n- Input inserter at (14.5, 74.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 at (21.5, 74.5) set to produce iron gear wheels\n- Connected with small electric poles throughout the area\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Transport belt connection errors\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly from furnaces - must use an inserter as intermediary\n- When placing output inserters for furnaces, ensure they have clear drop positions not blocked by other entities\n\n### Entity placement distance errors\n- Must move within 10 tiles of target position before placing entities\n- When working with distant factories, first navigate to the location before attempting modifications\n\n### Furnace output system issues\n- Output inserters must be placed on the opposite side from input inserters\n- Ensure proper spacing between furnace and output inserter (1 tile gap recommended)\n- Verify power connection for all inserters before attempting belt connections"}
