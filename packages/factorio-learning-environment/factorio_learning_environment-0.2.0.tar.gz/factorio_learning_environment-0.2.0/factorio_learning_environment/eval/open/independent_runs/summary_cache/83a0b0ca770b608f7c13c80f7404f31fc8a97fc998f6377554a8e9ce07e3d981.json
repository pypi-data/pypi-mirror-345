Remove any existing entities if necessary.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters with incorrect spacing or direction\n- Consider adjusting the spacing or direction when placing inserters to avoid collisions with existing entities. Ensure the reference position is clear of obstructions.\n\n### Errors when trying to connect belts directly to chests\n- Use inserters to transfer items to and from chests instead of attempting to connect belts directly.\n\n### Errors due to collision with nearby entities\n- Verify that the target position for placing entities is free from collisions with nearby entities. Adjust the position or direction as needed to avoid conflicts."}
