{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel and currently smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to place is available in your inventory. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) failed because there was no stone furnace in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all the necessary materials before attempting to craft an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, but the agent had 0 stones available, leading to a crafting failure.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace failed because there was no coal in the inventory at that time.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient extraction of items\n- Ensure that the required number of items are available for extraction. For example, an assertion error occurred because the agent attempted to extract 10 iron plates but only 9 were available. Always check the available quantity before extraction to avoid such errors."}
