{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace positioned at (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore. Previously, the furnace was observed with a warning \u201cno ingredients to smelt\u201d and a stored output of (iron-plate: 8). In the latest execution steps, the furnace received an insertion of 10 iron ore and subsequently experienced a timeout while attempting a smelting cycle. Following this, 5 iron plates were extracted from the furnace. (Structure remains as previously reported with updated smelting activity and error occurrences.)\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using API for item insertion\n- When inserting items into a structure, ensure that the target argument is a valid entity or entity group rather than a mere position. Passing a Position (e.g., during iron ore insertion into the furnace) leads to assertion errors. Check argument types before execution.\n\n### Resource Retrieval Errors near Target Structures\n- Verify that the target location contains the required resource before attempting retrieval. If get_resource_patch returns an error (e.g., \u201cNo resource of type coal at the specified location\u201d), adjust the retrieval coordinates or confirm the presence of the resource patch.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel during Insertion\n- Check inventory for the required fuel (e.g., coal) before attempting insertion into a furnace to ensure uninterrupted smelting cycles.\n- Verify resource availability to avoid errors when items are missing.\n\n### Insufficient Production and Process Delays in Smelting\n- When the furnace produces fewer iron plates than expected, ensure that both fuel and ore are supplied adequately.\n- Adjust production intervals to allow the furnace to complete its smelting cycle and monitor status warnings to prevent process timeouts.\n\n### Timeout Waiting for Smelting Completion\n- Ensure that a furnace has sufficient fuel and proper input quantities before beginning a new smelting cycle to avoid timeouts.\n- The recent timeout error, \u201cTimeout waiting for furnace to smelt iron ore,\u201d indicates that the smelting process did not complete as expected. Monitor furnace processing cycles, verify that the correct provisions are maintained, and adjust timing between insertions and extraction actions.\n- Maintain close oversight of the furnace\u2019s warning messages to preemptively identify delays.\n\n### Crafting Sub-ingredient Unavailability for Composite Items\n- When crafting composite items such as iron gear wheels, confirm that all required sub-ingredients (e.g., iron plates) are available or can be produced through a valid process (smelting in a furnace or using a crafting machine).\n- Recheck recipe requirements and ensure necessary production facilities (furnace or assembling machine) are operational before initiating the craft."}
