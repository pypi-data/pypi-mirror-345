{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is connected to a wooden chest at (4.5, -58.5) for storing extracted iron ore. It is currently working but the chest is full, requiring emptying to continue mining.\n- **Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT, indicating that its result inventory is full.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with a status of WORKING, processing iron ore.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT, indicating that its result inventory is full.\n  \n### Storage Chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** located at various positions such as (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). These chests are used for storing various items, including iron ore and other resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure to regularly extract the smelted iron plates from furnaces to prevent them from reaching FULL_OUTPUT status. This will allow continuous production without interruptions.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to ensure the burner mining drill can continue to operate without interruptions. Consider using additional chests or conveyor belts to manage overflow.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of iron ore to prevent them from reaching a NO_INGREDIENTS status. This can be managed by maintaining a steady flow of iron ore from the mining drill to the furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `Inventory`: A dictionary tracking the count of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `BurnerMiningDrill`: Tracks the status and warnings of the mining drill, including its fuel inventory and drop position.\n- `Furnace`: Tracks the status, warnings, and inventories of the furnaces, including fuel, source, and result inventories."}
