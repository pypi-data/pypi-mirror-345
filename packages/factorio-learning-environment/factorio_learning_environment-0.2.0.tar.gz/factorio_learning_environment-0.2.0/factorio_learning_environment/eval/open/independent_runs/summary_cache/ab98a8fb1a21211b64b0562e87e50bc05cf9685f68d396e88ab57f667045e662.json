{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nLocated at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0), this facility consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: 2 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place entities such as Transport Belts, Burner Inserters, and Wooden Chests.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- Verify the presence of required entities at specified positions before attempting operations like retrieval or placement. Example: Ensure a Stone Furnace exists at the intended position before trying to interact with it.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to prevent output blockage and ensure continuous operation of the mining drill.\n\n### Errors with insufficient ingredients\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid idle time and maximize production efficiency."}
