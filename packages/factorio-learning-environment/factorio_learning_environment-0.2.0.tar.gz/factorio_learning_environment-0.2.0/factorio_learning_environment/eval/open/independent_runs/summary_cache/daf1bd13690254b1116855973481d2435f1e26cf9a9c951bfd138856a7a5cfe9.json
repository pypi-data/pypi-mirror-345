{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0)**: Contains 25 iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0)**: Contains 97 iron plates and is fueled with coal.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5)**: Transfers items between the furnace at (61.0, -54.0) and a wooden chest at (61.5, -52.5).\n- **Burner Inserter at position (65.5, -52.5)**: Transfers items to the furnace at (64.0, -53.0).\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5)**: Contains coal and is connected to a burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0).\n- **Wooden Chest at position (44.5, -83.5)**: Contains coal.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple belt groups connecting various positions:\n- **BeltGroup**: Connects positions from (43.5, -81.5) to (49.5, -79.5) and further to (59.5, -69.5), although connection attempts have failed.\n- **BeltGroup**: Connects positions from (59.5, -69.5) to (65.0, -51.0) and to (66.0, -51.0), although connection attempts have failed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is sufficient space in the inventory before attempting to clear chests to prevent the \"Inventory is full\" error.\n\n### Belt Connection Errors\n- Verify that the path is valid and unobstructed before attempting to connect belts. Ensure that the target positions are accessible and correctly aligned.\n- Check for any existing entities that might block the placement of belts.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Make sure that the chest or entity from which items are being extracted is not blocked or full to avoid extraction failures.\n\n### Fueling and Resource Management\n- Ensure that entities like burner mining drills are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as transport belts, burner inserters, coal, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map, though detailed data is omitted in the logs."}
