The error `TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable` suggests that the function is being misused. Make sure to use the correct syntax and parameters when calling this function.\n\n### Inserter Drop Position Mismatch\n- Adjust inserter drop positions to match the intended chest positions. Ensure that the inserter's drop position aligns with the chest's position to avoid misalignment issues."}
