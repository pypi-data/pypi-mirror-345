{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) and a Burner Inserter at position(x=-14.5, y=-46.5) that picks up items from the drill's drop position and a Chest at position(x=-14.5, y=-47.5) to store the items.\n\n### Furnace at position(x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of a Furnace at position(x=0.0, y=0.0) with no input or output connections.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when placing entities too far away from the agent's position:\n  - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when placing entities in occupied positions:\n  - Check if the target position is occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n  - Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position to avoid collisions.\n* Errors when connecting entities:\n  - Use an Inserter to input items into a Chest instead of connecting belts directly to it.\n* Errors when operating entities:\n  - Ensure that entities have sufficient fuel to operate.\n  - Ensure that entities have a sink entity in place to accept their output.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Defined functions:\n  + `connect_entities`: connects two entities with a belt.\n  + `place_entity_next_to`: places an entity next to another entity.\n  + `place_entity`: places an entity at a specific position.\n* Important variables:\n  + `drill`: a Burner Mining Drill entity.\n  + `inserter`: a Burner Inserter entity.\n  + `chest`: a Chest entity.\n  + `furnace`: a Furnace entity.\n  + `iron_plate`: an item produced by the Furnace."}
