{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Smelting Setup at y=0\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at position (0, 0) - Currently idle, no ingredients but has coal fuel and 6 iron plates in output\n- Stone furnace at position (4, 0) - Currently idle, no ingredients but has coal fuel and 11 iron plates in output\n\n###Coal Mining Setup at y=-86\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (40, -86) - Currently not operational due to lack of fuel\n- Iron chest at position (40.5, -84.5) - Contains 2 coal\n- Transport belt system:\n  * Belt group connecting drill output to chest position\n  * Belt running from (42.5, -84.5) to (40.5, -84.5)\n  * Belt group running from (38.5, -83.5) to (41.5, -83.5)\n\n###Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex at y=-73\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (0, -75) - Not operational due to lack of fuel\n- Burner mining drill at position (-2, -73) - Operational with coal fuel, output blocked\n- Stone furnace at position (1.0, -73.0) - Has coal fuel but no ingredients, contains 39 iron plates\n- Stone furnace at position (-1.0, -71.0) - Operational with coal fuel, contains 53 iron plates\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-36.0, -81.0) - Operational with coal fuel, output blocked\n- Stone furnace at position (-35.0, -79.0) - Working with coal fuel, contains 10 copper plates\n- Three burner inserters:\n  * One at position (-35.5, -82.5) - Fueled and operational but waiting for space\n  * One at position (-34.5, -80.5) - Fueled but waiting for space in destination\n  * New inserter at position (-33.5, -78.5) - Fueled but waiting for source items\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors with precise entity positioning\n- When placing furnaces to collect from drills, use the exact drop position coordinates (e.g., x=-35.5 instead of x=-35.0)\n- Position differences of 0.5 are significant and must be respected\n- Use the drill's drop_position attribute for exact placement coordinates\n- Ensure furnaces are placed at exact drop positions with a tolerance of 0.1\n- When the drill shows a drop position of (x=-35.5, y=-79.5), the furnace must be placed at exactly those coordinates\n- The game rounds placement positions (e.g., trying to place at -35.5 results in -35.0) - need to find a way to place at exact half positions\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing entities, check if the target position is already occupied\n- If a furnace or other entity already exists at the target position, either use the existing entity or remove it first\n- Double-check coordinates before placement to avoid conflicts with existing structures\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Before attempting to place entities (like wooden chests), ensure you have crafted or obtained the required entity first\n- Check inventory contents before placement attempts to avoid placement failures\n\n### Errors when trying to craft complex items with multiple sub-ingredients\n- When crafting items like offshore pumps, ensure you have all required sub-ingredients or can craft them\n- For items requiring electronic circuits, you need copper plates which must be smelted first\n- Plan the production chain backwards: identify all base materials needed\n- Set up the necessary smelting operations for base materials before attempting to craft complex items\n\n### Errors when trying to insert fuel without having it\n- Ensure you have the required fuel type in your inventory before attempting to fuel entities\n- Collect necessary fuel (like coal) from storage or mining operations before attempting to power entities\n- Plan fuel collection routes to maintain efficient operations\n\n### Errors related to entity output blockage\n- When placing collecting entities (like furnaces), ensure they are placed exactly at the drill's drop position\n- The position difference of 0.5 in both X and Y coordinates can cause output blockage\n- For optimal placement, use the exact drop position coordinates provided by the drill\n- When using inserters, ensure the drop"}
