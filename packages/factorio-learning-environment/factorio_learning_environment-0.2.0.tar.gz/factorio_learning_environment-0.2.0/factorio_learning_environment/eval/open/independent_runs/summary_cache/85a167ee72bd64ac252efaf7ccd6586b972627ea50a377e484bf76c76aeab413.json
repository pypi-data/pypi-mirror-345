{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (x=4.5, y=-58.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) used as a drop chest for iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-56.5) used as a storage chest for transferred iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple wooden chests positioned between (x=-17.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-2.5, y=-52.5) used for storing and transferring iron plates.\n- Iron chest at position (x=-3.5, y=-52.5) used for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnaces at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Transferring Items to Non-Existent Chests\n- Ensure that the target chest exists at the specified position before attempting to transfer items. This can be verified by checking the map data or ensuring the chest has been placed correctly.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent them from becoming full. Consider upgrading to larger chests or redistributing items to avoid overflow.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply them with iron ore or other required materials to maintain production efficiency.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int = 10\n- `wood`: int = 6\n- `iron-ore`: int = 370\n- `iron-plate`: int = 5700\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int = 4\n\nThese variables represent the current inventory of the agent, which is crucial for planning future actions and managing resources effectively."}
