{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of a wooden chest that currently has no inventory. It is used to store coal and other resources.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill that is currently out of fuel. It is used to extract resources from the ground.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) which is connected to the burner mining drill for resource transfer.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting from the wooden chest**: \n  - Ensure that the wooden chest has coal available before attempting to extract. The extraction attempts failed because the chest was empty after multiple extractions.\n  \n- **Errors when using the burner mining drill**: \n  - The burner mining drill requires fuel to operate. Ensure that the drill is supplied with coal or other fuel sources to avoid it being in a NO_FUEL state.\n  \n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: \n  - Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. This may lead to errors if the target tile is already occupied.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `extract_item(entity_type: Prototype, position: Position, quantity: int)`: \n    - **Failure Mode**: Could not extract coal from the wooden chest when it was empty.\n    - **Success Mode**: Successfully extracted coal when available.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wooden_chest: Chest`\n  - `burner_mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill`\n  - `current_inventory: dict` (type: {'wood': int, 'coal': int, 'iron-ore': int, 'iron-plate': int})"}
