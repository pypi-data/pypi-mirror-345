A **Wooden Chest** was successfully crafted, which will allow the **Burner Mining Drill** to output its resources.\n2. The updated inventory now shows:\n   - **Wooden Chest:** 1 (successfully crafted)\n   - **Iron Chest:** 1 (still empty)\n   - **Transport Belts:** 2 (available for further use)\n   - **Wood:** 4 (remaining after crafting)\n   - Other items remain unchanged.\n\n3. The **Wooden Chest** has been placed correctly next to the output drop position of the **Burner Mining Drill**. This setup will allow the drill to offload resources into the chest, resolving the blockage issue.\n\n### Current Status of Entities:\n- **Wooden Chest:** Positioned at (-16.5, 23.5) and ready to receive items.\n- **Iron Chest:** Positioned at (-10.5, 22.5) and still empty.\n- **Burner Mining Drill:** Operational and now able to output resources into the Wooden Chest.\n- **Transport Belt:** Successfully connects the drill to the Iron Chest, but the drill needs to output first.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Monitor the output** from the **Burner Mining Drill** to ensure it is functioning correctly and transferring resources to the Wooden Chest.\n2. **Consider crafting additional items** or expanding the setup to improve efficiency, such as more furnaces or additional belts.\n3. **Gather more resources** to keep the production chain running smoothly.\n\nLet's observe the output from the **Burner Mining Drill** and ensure that resources are being transferred to the **Wooden Chest**.
