{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Location:**\n  - Mining Drill: Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Wooden Chest: Position(x=-14.5, y=-46.5)\n  - Inserter: Position(x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Furnace: Position(x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Output Inserter: Position(x=-1.5, y=0.5)\n\n- **Components:**\n  - **Burner Mining Drill** at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=-14.5, y=-46.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n  - **Stone Furnace** at Position(x=0.0, y=0.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n  - **Output Inserter** at Position(x=-1.5, y=0.5): Transfers iron plates from the furnace to another location.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before placing an entity. Check for existing objects that might block placement.\n\n### Errors when Inspecting or Interacting with Non-Existent Entities\n- Verify the presence of an entity at the specified coordinates before attempting to interact with it. This prevents errors related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Maintain sufficient quantities of required items in your inventory before attempting actions like inserting items into entities.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Regularly check the fuel status of entities like mining drills and inserters to ensure they are operational. Refill them with the necessary fuel to avoid interruptions in their operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure inserters are correctly positioned and fueled to transfer items between entities effectively. Adjust their positions if they are not functioning as intended."}
