{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing coal.\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal, with a warning that the chest at drop position is full.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) containing iron plates and copper plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) moving items from a transport belt to a wooden chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5) moving items from a wooden chest to a stone furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0).\n- Stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) containing copper plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) moving items from a stone furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) to a wooden chest.\n- Stone furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Transportation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt group connecting various parts of the processing facilities, including belts from position (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5) and from (x=4.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from chests\n- Ensure that the chest is not empty and that the agent is within range to extract items.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly check and manage inventory space to prevent it from becoming full, which can block harvesting and extraction operations.\n\n### Errors when inserters are blocked\n- Clear blockages from inserters to ensure they can continue to move items efficiently. This includes ensuring that destination chests are not full.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt, and refuel them as needed to maintain continuous operation."}
