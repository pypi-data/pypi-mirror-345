{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron plate production system at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) for mining iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) for transferring items between the drill and furnace.\n- Chest at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n#### Copper plate production system at position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0) for mining copper ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (x=-26.0, y=-61.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-27.5, y=-62.5) for transferring items between the drill and furnace.\n- Chest at position (x=-28.5, y=-62.5) for storing copper ore.\n- Chest at position (x=-25.5, y=-59.5) for storing copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when crafting items without required ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting a burner mining drill requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and a stone furnace.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Verify that the entity to be placed is available in the inventory before attempting to place it. For example, placing a burner mining drill requires having one in the inventory.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to craft items that require a crafting machine or furnace\n- Use the appropriate crafting machine or furnace to craft items that cannot be crafted manually. For example, automation science packs require copper plates, which must be smelted in a furnace.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. For example, placing a burner inserter next to a stone furnace requires sufficient spacing to avoid overlapping.\n\n#### Errors when mining resources from incorrect locations\n- Verify the presence of the desired resource at the target location before placing a mining drill. For example, placing a burner mining drill on a tile without copper ore will result in an error.\n\n#### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to the required source items. For example, an inserter waiting for copper ore needs a mining drill to produce the ore.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- Provide the necessary ingredients to the furnace for smelting. For example, a stone furnace requires iron ore to produce iron plates.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are out of fuel\n- Ensure mining drills are fueled with coal to operate. For example, a burner mining drill without coal will stop functioning.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are blocked by items on the ground\n- Provide a sink entity (e.g., a chest or inserter) to collect the output of the mining drill. For example, a burner mining drill with blocked output needs a chest to store the mined resources."}
