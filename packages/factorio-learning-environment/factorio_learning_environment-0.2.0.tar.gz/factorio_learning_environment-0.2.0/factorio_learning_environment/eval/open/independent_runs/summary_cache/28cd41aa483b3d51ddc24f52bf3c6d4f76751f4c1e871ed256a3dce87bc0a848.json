{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around x=41-45, y=-80-82)\nComplex structure consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (42.5, -80.5) configured to move items between belt and chest\n  - Second inserter at (43.5, -80.5) configured to move items between belt and furnace\n- Belt group running from (42.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -81.5)\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n\nThe structure appears to be a coal processing setup with automated transport system, though the inserters are still being configured for optimal orientation.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Group Access Errors\n- Attempting to access non-existent 'input_position' attribute on BeltGroup objects\n- When working with belt groups, use the appropriate belt group properties instead of individual belt properties\n\n### Entity Configuration Issues\n- Multiple reconfigurations of inserter orientations indicate a need for better initial placement planning\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are properly aligned with connected entities before placement\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills to prevent work stoppage\n- Implement proactive refueling when fuel levels get low rather than waiting for complete depletion\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\nNone defined in the provided logs\n\nImportant Variables:\n- drill (BurnerMiningDrill): Mining entity with position, fuel, and status attributes\n- chest (Chest): Storage entity with inventory management\n- inserter (BurnerInserter): Transport entity with pickup/drop positions and direction\n- furnace (Furnace): Processing entity with fuel and ingredient management\n- belt (BeltGroup): Transport system with input/output management\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.NO_FUEL: Requires fuel to operate\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Ready but no items to process\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Missing required materials\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Operating as expected\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: No items present (for belts)"}
