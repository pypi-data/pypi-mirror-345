{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) supplying iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) for transferring items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storage.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) for transferring coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -77.5) for coal storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Not Operational Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in the furnace's inventory to keep it operational. The Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) is repeatedly reported as having no ingredients.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- Verify the existence and position of entities before attempting to retrieve them. An error occurred when trying to get a Wooden Chest at position (-14.0, -50.0), which was not found.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drills\n- Ensure that there is a clear path or sink entity for the output of mining drills to prevent blockage. Both the coal and iron ore Burner Mining Drills are waiting for space in the destination due to output blockage.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `get_entity(entity_type: Prototype, position: Position)`: Attempts to retrieve an entity of a specified type at a given position. Failure occurs if no entity of the specified type is found at the given position.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace_output_chest`: Attempted to assign a Wooden Chest entity at position (-14.0, -50.0), but failed due to non-existence.\n- `current_inventory`: Dictionary storing the current inventory status, e.g., `{'coal': 80, 'iron-plate': 212}`."}
