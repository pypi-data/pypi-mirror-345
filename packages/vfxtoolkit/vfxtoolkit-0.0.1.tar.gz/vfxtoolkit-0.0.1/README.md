# About This VFX Toolkit

This is a passion project which ultimately aims to provides a fully-featured
pipeline for visual effects and media production.

Planned features includes:
 - Cross-platform software packaging system (based on CMake, GIT & Python).
 - Production context system (commands and API to handle project & shot environments).
 - Layered configuration system.
 - QT-based application launcher.
 - VFX database model, object-oriented API and QT widgets.
 - QT-based media publisher (standalone then DCCs plugins).
 - Various helper libraries (Like media query & transcoder wrappers).

As of today however, it is merely a tiny set of in-progress rough libraries,
which are more of a pretext to get the git repo & pypi project going than
anything else. So if you're interested, please come back in a few months, by
then hopefully the project will have become something interesting :).
