The agent made several attempts to craft and place a Research Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) \u2013 intended to supply Automation Science Packs for research \u2013 but repeated issues (such as missing inventory items and unavailable sub\u2011ingredients) prevented placement. In addition, while the logs show interactions with existing furnaces (an iron furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) for smelting operations, these were not built in the current sequence but merely referenced from the game environment.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors (get_entities):\n  \u2013 Use the correct function signature when calling get_entities. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments such as \u201cradius\u201d and do not supply positional parameters if none are expected.\n  \n\u2022 Null Iterable Handling:\n  \u2013 Check that any function returning an entity list does not yield None before iterating over its results. Implement a fallback (e.g., default to an empty list) to prevent \u2018NoneType\u2019 iteration errors.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting Resource Deficiencies:\n  \u2013 Before attempting to craft complex items (like a Lab), ensure that all required sub\u2011ingredients (for example, iron\u2011gear\u2011wheels, electronic\u2011circuits, and copper\u2011cables) are available through established production chains.\n  \n\u2022 Inventory Verification for Placement:\n  \u2013 Always verify the inventory contains the item needed for placement (such as a Lab) prior to executing placement calls, to avoid errors indicating \u201cNo lab in inventory.\u201d"}
