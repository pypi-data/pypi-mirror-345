{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently working with 8 units of coal as fuel and smelting 19 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) that transfers items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) used for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) that moves items from the wooden chest to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** group connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) that moves items from the transport belt to another wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron plates. Current inventory: 56 iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates. Currently working with 9 units of coal as fuel and smelting 11 units of copper ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (8.5, 0.5) that feeds copper ore into the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (11.5, 0.5) that extracts copper plates from the furnace and places them into a wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (12.5, 0.5) used for storing copper plates. Current inventory: 7 copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required item in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a wooden chest or burner inserter without having them in inventory results in an error.\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables or entities\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined before use. For instance, using 'output_inserter' or 'ore_chest' without defining them leads to errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract items from non-existent or incorrect entities\n- Verify the existence and type of the entity before attempting to extract items. Ensure the entity contains the items you wish to extract.\n\n### Errors when inspecting non-existent entities\n- Ensure the entity you wish to inspect exists at the specified position. For example, attempting to get a wooden chest at a position where it does not exist will cause an error."}
