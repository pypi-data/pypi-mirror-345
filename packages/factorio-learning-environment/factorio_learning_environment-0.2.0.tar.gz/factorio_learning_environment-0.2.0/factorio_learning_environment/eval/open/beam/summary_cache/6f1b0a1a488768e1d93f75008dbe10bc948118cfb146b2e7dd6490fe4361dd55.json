Sometimes, refreshing or restarting the environment can resolve issues.\n2. **Review Command History**: If possible, check the command history to identify any commands that may have caused the environment to hang.\n3. **Start Fresh**: If the environment remains unresponsive, consider starting a new game or resetting the current environment to regain functionality.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- If you can reset or restart the environment, please do so.\n- If you need help with specific commands or actions after the reset, let me know, and I can assist in crafting those commands.\n\nPlease advise on how you would like to proceed, and I am here to help!", "summary_range": "[1-366]"}
