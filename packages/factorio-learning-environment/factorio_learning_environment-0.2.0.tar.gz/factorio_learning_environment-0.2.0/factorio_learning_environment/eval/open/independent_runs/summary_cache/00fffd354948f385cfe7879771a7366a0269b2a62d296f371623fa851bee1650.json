The blockage was cleared by picking up the dropped ore, and by step 90 its status was updated to WORKING with warnings cleared.\n\u2022 Drill Inserter at position (\u201313.5, \u201347.5) with pickup at (\u201312.5, \u201347.5) and drop at (\u201314.5, \u201347.5).\n\u2022 Belt Connections:\n\u2003\u2013 An attempted connection was made between the mining drill\u2019s drop (\u201314.5, \u201348.5) and the belt network at (\u201314.5, \u201347.5) (step 89); however, later inspections (steps 90\u201391) did not locate an active BeltGroup near the drill\u2019s output.\n\u2003\u2013 Efforts to merge an isolated ore-bearing belt group (featuring a transport belt at (\u201315.5, \u201348.5)) with the smelting network\u2019s empty belt group failed (steps 92\u201393) due to an invalid connectivity path.\n\u2003\u2013 A transport belt at (\u201314.5, \u201348.5) was replaced (step 94) to clear blockage, yet an extraction attempt from the belt at (\u201315.5, \u201348.5) (step 95) resulted in failure.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Belt Network Merge and Connectivity Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate the existence and proper alignment of both ore-bearing and empty belt groups before attempting any merge operations.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the connection endpoints (for example, transport belt at (\u201315.5, \u201348.5) and belt input at (\u201314.5, \u201347.5)) are accessible and form a valid path.\n\u2022 Transport Belt Extraction Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the targeted transport belt contains the expected iron ore before initiating extraction.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the transport belt entity is active and its inventory reflects the expected items.\n\u2022 Transport Belt Sink Placement Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Check that target tiles and candidate offsets are unobstructed and buildable before placing sink components.\n\u2022 Repositioning and Prototype Resolution Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Use accurate prototype identifiers when repositioning entities to prevent mismatches.\n\u2022 Wooden Chest Sink Placement Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure candidate positions for placing wooden chest sinks adhere to buildability criteria.\n\u2022 Resource and Inventory Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Maintain sufficient inventory (e.g. transport belts) and carry out timely crafting to avoid connection or placement shortages.\n\u2022 API and Parameter Handling:\n\u2003\u2013 Supply correct parameters (such as using None when required) and always validate tile occupancy and proximity to ensure successful entity placement.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nshift_entity_local(entity: Entity, offset: Tuple[float, float]) -> Entity\n\u2003\u2022 Shifts the given entity\u2019s position locally by the specified offset.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Previous invocations generally succeeded; however, later repositioning of the mining drill encountered prototype resolution issues.\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 furnace_input_chest_pos (Position) \u2013 holds the position of the furnace\u2019s input chest.\n\u2022 current_player_inventory (Inventory) \u2013 tracks the current state of the player\u2019s inventory."}
