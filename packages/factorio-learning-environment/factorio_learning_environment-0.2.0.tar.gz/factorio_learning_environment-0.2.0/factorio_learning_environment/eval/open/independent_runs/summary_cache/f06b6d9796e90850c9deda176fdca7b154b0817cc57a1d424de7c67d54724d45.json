{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to extract and process iron ore using the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): This drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest. It is currently fueled with coal and operational, but there is a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): This chest stores the extracted iron ore from the mining drill. It currently contains 37 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): This inserter is responsible for transferring iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace. It is fueled with coal but is currently waiting for source items due to misalignment issues.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but is not receiving iron ore due to the inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates a persistent alignment issue.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chest\n- Regularly monitor and empty the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to refuel inserters and mining drills. Running out of coal can disrupt the operation of these entities.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Non-Existent Items\n- Coal cannot be crafted as it is a raw resource. Ensure that coal is gathered from the environment rather than attempting to craft it."}
