Regularly check inventory levels and gather coal as needed.\n\n- **Errors inserting items into the furnace**\n  - Verify that the furnace has available capacity for the items being inserted.

Clear out the furnace or provide it with fuel to resume operations.\n\n- **Warnings about the wooden chest being full**\n  - Regularly empty the wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue depositing iron ore.
