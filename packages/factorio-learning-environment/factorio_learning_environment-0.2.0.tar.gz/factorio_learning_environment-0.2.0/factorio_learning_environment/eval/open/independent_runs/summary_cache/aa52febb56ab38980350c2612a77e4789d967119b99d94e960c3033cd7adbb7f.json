{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row with wooden chests:\n- Mining drill at (-10, -59) outputting to chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-8, -59) outputting to chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-6, -59) outputting to chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are currently out of fuel but have access to iron ore resources\n\n### Copper/Iron Processing Setup at (-28, -61)\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) connected to\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59) with\n- Burner inserter at (-28.5, -58.5) feeding the furnace\n- Additional burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving items to\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing processed plates\n\n### Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nFour furnace setup with input/output infrastructure:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0)\n- Input inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n\n### Additional Smelting Setup at (-23, -58)\n- Two stone furnaces at (-23, -58) and (-21, -58)\n- Multiple burner inserters for item movement\n- Storage chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- Ensure there is a valid path between the source and destination points when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Check that the path is not blocked by other entities\n- Verify the distance is not too large for a single belt connection\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Check for entity collisions before placing new entities\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, ensure there is enough space\n- Consider using different spacing or directions if initial placement fails\n- Verify the target area is suitable for placement (not water or other unsuitable terrain)\n\n### Resource management\n- Mining drills need fuel to operate - ensure coal is supplied\n- Keep furnaces supplied with fuel to maintain operation"}
