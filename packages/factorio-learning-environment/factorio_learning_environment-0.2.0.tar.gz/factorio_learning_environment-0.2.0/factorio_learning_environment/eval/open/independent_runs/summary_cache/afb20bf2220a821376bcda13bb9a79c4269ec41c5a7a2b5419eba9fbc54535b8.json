{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring resources from the chests to the furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing excess iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -48.5) containing 1527 iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -47.5) containing 465 iron plates.\n\n### Inserter Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5), (-8.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Argument Type in Function Call\n- Ensure that the correct type of argument is passed to functions. For example, when using `inspect_inventory`, pass an `Entity` or `Position` object, not an integer.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in your inventory. For example, ensure you have enough coal before refueling a mining drill.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be resolved by ensuring the supply chain is not interrupted and resources are continuously fed into the system.\n\n### Furnace Belt Blockage\n- Make sure that the destination for items being transferred by inserters is not blocked. This can be achieved by regularly clearing the output of furnaces and ensuring there is enough space for items to be placed."}
