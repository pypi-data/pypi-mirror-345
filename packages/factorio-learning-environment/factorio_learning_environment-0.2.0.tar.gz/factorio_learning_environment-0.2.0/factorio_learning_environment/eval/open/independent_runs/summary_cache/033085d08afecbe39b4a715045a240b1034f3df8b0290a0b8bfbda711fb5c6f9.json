{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components, starting from (x=4.5, y=-9.5) to various positions, ensuring fluid flow.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) with a wooden chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) collecting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for further processing.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=20.0, y=20.0) with a wooden chest at position (x=19.5, y=18.5) collecting copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) processing copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for producing copper cables.\n- Inserter at position (x=7.5, y=5.5) moving items into the assembling machine.\n- Belt network connecting the furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) to the assembling machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=-3.5, y=0.5) and (x=-3.5, y=2.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Inserters at positions (x=-3.5, y=1.5) and (x=9.5, y=5.5) for transferring items between chests and belts.\n\n### Pipe and Electricity Network\n- Pipe Groups and Electricity Groups connecting various components, ensuring fluid and power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure all machines and inserters are connected to a power source. Many entities are currently not receiving electricity, which is preventing them from functioning.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all production facilities have the necessary ingredients to operate. For instance, the assembling machine cannot produce copper cables due to missing copper plates.\n\n### Errors with Full Output\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
