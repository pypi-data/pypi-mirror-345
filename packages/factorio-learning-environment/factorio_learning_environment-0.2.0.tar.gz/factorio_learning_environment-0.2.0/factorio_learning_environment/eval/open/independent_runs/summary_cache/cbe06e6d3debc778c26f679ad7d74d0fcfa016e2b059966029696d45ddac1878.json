{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Connected via a series of pipes and underground pipes, with the steam engine now generating power successfully.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=10.0, y=0.0), (x=13.0, y=0.0), and (x=16.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5) to transfer materials between furnaces.\n\n### Research Lab at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs and currently researching logistics.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5) with status EntityStatus.EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status EntityStatus.WORKING, carrying water.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=22.5) with status EntityStatus.WORKING, carrying steam.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), and (x=1.5, y=6.5), providing power to various structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure there are no obstructions or misplaced pipes when connecting pipes between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Clear any obstructing pipes before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Verify that the placement of pipes and underground pipes does not block the connection path. Re-evaluate the layout to ensure a clear path for connections.\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine Power Generation\n- Confirm that all components of the power generation system (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are properly connected and operational to ensure the steam engine generates power."}
