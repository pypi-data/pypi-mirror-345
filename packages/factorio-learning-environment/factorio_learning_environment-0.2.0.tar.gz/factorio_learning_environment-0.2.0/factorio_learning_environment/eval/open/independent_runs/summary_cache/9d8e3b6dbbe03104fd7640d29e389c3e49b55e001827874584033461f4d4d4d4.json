{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Unit at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure you are within the maximum allowable distance (10 units) from the target position when placing entities. Move closer to the desired location before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter alignment issues\n- Double-check the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can lead to items not being transferred as expected.\n\n### Fuel management errors\n- Regularly refuel entities such as mining drills, furnaces, and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish them as necessary to prevent interruptions."}
