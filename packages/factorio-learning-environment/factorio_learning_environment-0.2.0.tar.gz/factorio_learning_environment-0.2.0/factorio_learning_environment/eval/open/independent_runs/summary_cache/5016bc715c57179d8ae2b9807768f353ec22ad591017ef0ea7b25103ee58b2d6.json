{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures built on the map. The agent has attempted to place several entities, but none have been successfully placed due to various errors. The map remains empty with no entities present.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is buildable. Check the buildability of a tile before attempting to place an entity like a Stone Furnace or Wooden Chest.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or restricted tiles\n- Verify that the tile is not occupied or restricted for the specific entity you are trying to place. This includes checking for global build restrictions or environmental settings that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operation\n- Ensure that resources, such as coal, are available and supplied to entities like Furnaces to enable their operation. Verify resource availability before attempting to use entities that require them.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without checking environmental settings\n- Check environmental settings and responsiveness to ensure that the environment is correctly initialized and responsive to entity placements.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect placement attempts\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure they are suitable for the intended entity. Avoid attempting to place entities at coordinates that are not feasible or outside the buildable area.\n\n### General Tips\n- Before placing any entity, conduct an inventory check to ensure you have the necessary items available.\n- Regularly check the map for any changes in buildability or environmental restrictions that may affect entity placement."}
