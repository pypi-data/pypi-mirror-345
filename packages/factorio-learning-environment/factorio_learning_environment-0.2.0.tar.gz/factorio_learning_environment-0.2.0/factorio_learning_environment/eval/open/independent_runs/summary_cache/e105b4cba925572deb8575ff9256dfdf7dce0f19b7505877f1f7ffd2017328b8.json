{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units remaining)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest, Burner inserter\n  - Resources: Iron ore (9997 units remaining)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: 556 units of iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units remaining)\n  - Pickup position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest, Burner mining drill\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units remaining)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. The current misalignment is causing the inserter to not function correctly.\n- Correct the inserter's drop position to align with the furnace to ensure iron ore is transferred correctly.\n\n### Errors in Refueling and Resource Management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. An error was encountered when trying to insert coal without having any in the inventory.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to function. Currently, the furnace is not receiving iron ore due to incorrect inserter setup.\n\n### General Placement and Positioning Errors\n- Before placing or repositioning entities, ensure that the intended positions are free and correctly aligned with other entities to avoid operational issues."}
