{"content": "The error indicates that the furnace's inventory is full, preventing the insertion of additional coal. To resolve this, we need to clear space in the furnace by extracting any existing items. Here's how you can proceed:\n\n### Steps to Clear Furnace Inventory and Proceed with Crafting\n\n1. **Extract Items from the Furnace:**\n   - Check the furnace's inventory and extract any items, such as iron plates or other materials, to free up space.\n\n2. **Insert Coal and Iron Ore:**\n   - Once space is available, insert coal and iron ore into the furnace to continue smelting.\n\n3. **Craft the Steam Engine:**\n   - Ensure you have the necessary iron plates and iron gear wheels to craft the Steam Engine.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Extract items from the furnace to free up space\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\n\n# Extract iron plates if present\niron_plates_in_furnace = furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\nif iron_plates_in_furnace > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, new_furnace.position, iron_plates_in_furnace)\n    print(f\"Extracted {iron_plates_in_furnace} iron plates from the furnace.\")\n\n# Extract any other items that might be blocking space\nfor item, count in furnace_inventory.items():\n    if count > 0:\n        extract_item(item, new_furnace.position, count)\n        print(f\"Extracted {count} of {item} from the furnace.\")\n\n# Step 2: Insert coal and iron ore into the furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Inserted coal into the furnace.\")\n\n# Insert iron ore for smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, new_furnace, quantity=10)\nprint(\"Inserted iron ore into the furnace.\")\n\n# Allow time for smelting\nsleep(30)\n\n# Step 3: Craft the Steam Engine\n# Ensure you have sufficient iron plates and iron gear wheels\niron_plates_in_inventory = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\niron_gear_wheels_in_inventory = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0)\n\n# Check if all components for the Steam Engine are in place\nneeded_plates_gear = iron_plates_needed <= iron_plates_in_inventory and \\\n                     iron_gear_wheels_needed <= iron_gear_wheels_in_inventory\nassert needed_plates_gear, \"Insufficient resources for Steam Engine.\"\n\n# Craft the Steam Engine\ncrafted_engine = craft_item(Prototype.SteamEngine, quantity=1)\nassert crafted_engine > 0, \"Failed to craft the Steam Engine.\"\n\n# Verify the setup\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after crafting: {get_entities()}\")\nprint(f\"Final Inventory Status: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- Regularly check and manage the furnace inventory to prevent it from becoming full.\n- Ensure that you have a sufficient supply of coal and iron ore to keep the furnace running efficiently.\n- Keep track of your inventory to ensure you have enough materials for crafting complex items like the Steam Engine.", "summary_range": "[1-182]"}
