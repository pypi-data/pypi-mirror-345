{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it into a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0), currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5), waiting for source items to transfer.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5), waiting for source items to transfer.\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5), currently empty.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), extracting coal and dropping it into an iron chest at position (41.5, -80.5).\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5), storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5), waiting for source items to transfer.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5), currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. Check if the connected chests or furnaces have items available for transfer.\n\n### Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position Full\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and inserters.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to prevent idle time."}
