{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, transferring items between chests.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- BeltGroup connecting from position (-25.5, -70.5) to (-20.5, -69.5) facilitating copper ore transport.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with no fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items, transferring items between chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions to facilitate item transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n- Ensure that the source and target positions are valid and that the entities being connected are not None. Verify that the entities have valid attributes before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces not receiving ingredients\n- Check that the transport belts and inserters are correctly positioned and functional to deliver the required ingredients to the furnaces. Ensure that the supply chain is complete and that there are no blockages or missing connections.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned with both the source and destination entities."}
