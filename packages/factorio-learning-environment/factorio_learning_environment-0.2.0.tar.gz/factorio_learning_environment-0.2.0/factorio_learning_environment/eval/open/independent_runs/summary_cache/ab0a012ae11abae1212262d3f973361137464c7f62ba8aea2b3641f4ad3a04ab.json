{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -25.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is intended to generate electricity using steam produced by the boiler, which requires a connection to a water source via the offshore pump.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18, -49)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Iron plate mine at position(5, -73)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is used for research purposes.\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine at position -21.5, 25.5\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to boiler and steam engine connection\n- Ensure that the boiler is connected to a suitable water source and that the pipes are correctly placed to allow for fluid transfer. Check for any blockages or disconnections in the pipe network.\n- Verify that the boiler has fuel and is operational before attempting to connect it to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Confirm that all entities requiring power, such as the lab and assembling machine, are connected to a power network. Use small electric poles to extend power connections as needed."}
