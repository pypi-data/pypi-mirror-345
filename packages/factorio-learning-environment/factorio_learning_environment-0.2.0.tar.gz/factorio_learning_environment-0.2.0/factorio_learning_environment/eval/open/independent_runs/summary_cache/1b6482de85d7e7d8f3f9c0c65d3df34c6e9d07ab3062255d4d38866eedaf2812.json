{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, with a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore with an inventory of 14 iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates, currently holding 1 iron ore and having produced 49 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring items between chests, fueled with coal and currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing an entity is not occupied by another entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors related to full storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full chests. This will ensure continuous operation of mining facilities.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
