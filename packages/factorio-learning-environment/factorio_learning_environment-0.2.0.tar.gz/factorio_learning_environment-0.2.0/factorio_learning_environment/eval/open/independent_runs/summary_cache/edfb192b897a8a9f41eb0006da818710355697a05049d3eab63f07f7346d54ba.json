{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine with various pipes at positions such as (x=-3.5, y=26.5), (x=-2.5, y=26.5), etc.\n- Connected to the electricity network with small electric poles at positions like (x=9.5, y=39.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for transferring coal\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting operations\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs for coal transportation, including belts at positions such as (x=50.5, y=-86.5) and (x=43.5, y=-84.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Operational\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly connected and not blocked. Check for missing connections between the boiler and the steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Regularly check the status of pipes to ensure they are not full or empty unexpectedly. Verify all connections are intact and fluids are flowing correctly.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients for smelting. Regularly supply the furnace with required materials to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source item is available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity and maintain a steady supply of items."}
