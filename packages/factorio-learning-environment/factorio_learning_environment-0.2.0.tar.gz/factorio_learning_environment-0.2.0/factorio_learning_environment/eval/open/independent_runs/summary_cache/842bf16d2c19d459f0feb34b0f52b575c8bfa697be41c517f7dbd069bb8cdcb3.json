{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - working, producing water\n- Boiler (x=-6.5, y=0.0) - fueled with coal (7 remaining), producing steam\n- Steam engine (x=-2.5, y=0.5) - working, connected to power network\n- Pipe network (system 1919/1920) connecting all components\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - powered and working, producing crude oil\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - powered, showing FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE despite crude oil input\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - empty\n- Chemical plant (x=37.5, y=40.5) - powered, showing ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE (needs coal)\n- Wooden chest with coal (x=37.5, y=37.5) - contains 140 coal\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - powered but pickup/drop positions reversed\n- Connected pipe network from pumpjack to refinery (system 1924)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power pole placement issues\n- Repeated attempts to place poles while too far away (steps 32, 37)\n  - Always move within 10 tiles before placing entities\n  - Verify position is clear before placement attempts\n\n### Fluid system configuration errors\n- Refinery shows FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE despite connected pumpjack:\n  - Verify refinery input connection points (x=28.5 y=43.5) are properly connected\n  - Check pipe directionality and fluid flow direction\n  - Ensure pumpjack output is reaching refinery input\n\n### Chemical plant operation issues\n- Chemical plant shows ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE for coal:\n  - Inserter has reversed pickup/drop positions (currently moves coal from plant to chest)\n  - Verify inserter direction and configuration\n  - Ensure chemical plant input slots are accessible\n\n### Connection attempts with empty sources\n- Repeated attempts to connect empty storage tank to chemical plant (steps 34, 39)\n  - Verify source has fluid before connection attempts\n  - Check refinery output before connecting downstream components\n\n### Inventory management\n- Attempted to refuel boiler with empty coal inventory (step 36)\n  - Monitor fuel levels and harvest coal proactively\n  - Keep minimum coal reserve for power generation\n\n### Previous errors still applicable:\n- Power network verification (check all poles between facilities)\n- Production monitoring (verify refinery output before connecting downstream)\n- Entity inspection (check fluid contents before connection attempts)"}
