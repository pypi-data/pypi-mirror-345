# Grimoire Logger

Grimoire Logger is a lightweight Python logging library that outputs logs in a
structured JSON format. It is designed to make log parsing and analysis easier,
especially in distributed systems or environments where structured logging is
essential.

## Features

- **JSON-formatted logs**: Logs are output in a machine-readable JSON format.
- **Multiple log levels**: Supports `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `debug` levels.
- **Timestamped logs**: Each log entry includes a timestamp for better
  traceability.
- **Source identification**: Automatically includes the source file in the log
  output.
