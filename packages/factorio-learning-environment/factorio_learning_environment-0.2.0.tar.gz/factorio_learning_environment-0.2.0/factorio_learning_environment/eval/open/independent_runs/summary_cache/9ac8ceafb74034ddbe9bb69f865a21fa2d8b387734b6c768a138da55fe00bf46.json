{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and extracting iron ore from the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5). \n- Warning: The chest at drop position is full, which may hinder further mining activities.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing 337 iron ore. The chest is currently full, which is affecting the mining operation.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) currently working but has a warning indicating that the furnace result is full. It is set to produce iron plates.\n\n### Additional Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing 661 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to full chest**: The burner mining drill is unable to continue mining because the wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. To mitigate this, regularly check and empty the chest to ensure continuous mining operations.\n  \n- **Errors when inserting into a full furnace**: The stone furnace has a warning that its result inventory is full. Ensure to manage the output of the furnace by either emptying the output chest or crafting the items to avoid halting production.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: None noted in the execution logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Entity (Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0))\n  - `wooden_chest`: Entity (Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5))\n  - `stone_furnace`: Entity (Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0))\n  - `additional_wooden_chest`: Entity (Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5))\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary (Current inventory: {'wood': 4, 'coal': 3})"}
