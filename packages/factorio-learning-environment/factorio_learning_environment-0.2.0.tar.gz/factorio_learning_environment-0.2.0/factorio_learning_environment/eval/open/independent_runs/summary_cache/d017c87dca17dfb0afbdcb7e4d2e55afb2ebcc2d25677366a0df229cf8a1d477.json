{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with coal fuel, connected to small electric pole at (-3.5, 22.5), steam engine at (-1.5, 24.5), and pipe at (-7.5, 24.5).\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) not connected to the power network, with multiple small electric poles around positions (-2.5, 21.5) to (0.5, 22.5).\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5) connected to pipes at (-11.5, 23.5), (-10.5, 24.5), and (-9.5, 24.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to small electric poles and a wooden chest at (7.5, -61.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Lab with automation science packs, not receiving power.\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) with various inventories.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and there are no blockages when attempting to connect them between entities. Verify the path is clear from the starting to the ending position.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and receiving the necessary input liquid. Check for any warnings and resolve issues such as \"no input liquid\" or \"no fluid present in connections.\"\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a functional power network. Ensure that the electric poles are supplying power and are properly connected to the inserters.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Double-check the connection between the boiler and steam engine to ensure there are no placement blockages. Make sure all necessary pipes are correctly placed and connected."}
