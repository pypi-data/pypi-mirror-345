{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently refueled with coal and aligned to pick up from the chest and drop into the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position to facilitate the transfer of iron ore. The inserter's pickup position should match the chest's position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Refueling and Resource Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the inserter and mining drill with coal to maintain operational status. Consider redistributing existing coal or mining more coal when supplies are low.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to drop iron ore into the furnace. The drop position should align with the furnace's input position.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel entities as needed. If an error occurs due to a lack of coal, prioritize mining or redistributing coal resources."}
