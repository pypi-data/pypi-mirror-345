The error message indicates a collision with an existing inserter. Increase the spacing, change the direction, or change the reference position to avoid this.\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts between inserters\n- Ensure there is a valid path when connecting transport belts between inserters. The error message indicates that the path could not be normalized.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too close to existing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space when placing entities. The error message indicates a collision with an existing entity, in this case a stone furnace. Increase the spacing, change the direction, or change the reference position to avoid this.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to chests. Use an inserter to input items into the chest.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\nNo functions have been defined yet.\n```"}
