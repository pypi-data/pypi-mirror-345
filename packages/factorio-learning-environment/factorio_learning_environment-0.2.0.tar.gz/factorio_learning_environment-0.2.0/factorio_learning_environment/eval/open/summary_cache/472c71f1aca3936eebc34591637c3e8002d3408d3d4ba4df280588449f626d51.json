{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled and active  \n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5), intended to transfer items between mining drill, furnace, assembling machine, and chest; currently out of fuel and unable to operate properly  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates; not receiving power and thus inactive  \n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections; power network appears incomplete or insufficient to energize the assembler and inserters  \n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, inserters lack fuel and the assembling machine is not powered, causing production to halt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to burner inserters running out of fuel  \n- Burner inserters require fuel (coal) to operate; failure to insert coal into burner inserters results in them being unable to transfer items.  \n- Always ensure sufficient coal is harvested and inserted into burner inserters to keep them operational.  \n- Consider switching to electric inserters powered by electricity to avoid fuel dependency and simplify logistics.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters despite having coal in inventory  \n- Repeated failures to insert coal into burner inserters indicate possible timing or inventory synchronization issues.  \n- Verify that the agent\u2019s inventory is updated and that coal is physically available before attempting insertion.  \n- Avoid attempting to insert more coal than the inserter can hold or when it is already full.\n\n### Errors related to assembling machine not receiving power despite electric poles placed  \n- Assembling machine 2 reports zero energy and NO_POWER status even after connecting to power poles.  \n- Check that electric poles form a continuous power network with sufficient coverage and correct placement to energize all connected entities.  \n- Confirm that poles are properly connected and powered by a power source (e.g., steam engine or solar panel).  \n- Consider placing additional poles or repositioning existing ones to ensure full coverage of the assembling machine and inserters.\n\n### Errors due to attempting to insert items (coal, iron ore) not present in inventory  \n- Several errors occurred when trying to insert coal or iron ore that was not available in the agent\u2019s inventory.  \n- Always verify inventory contents before insertion attempts to avoid exceptions.  \n- Implement checks or conditional logic to skip insertion if the required item is missing.\n\n### General tips to mitigate fuel and power related errors  \n- Maintain a steady supply of coal by harvesting and distributing it efficiently to all burner entities.  \n- Transition to electric inserters and mining drills when possible to reduce fuel management complexity.  \n- Regularly verify power network connectivity and energy levels of electric entities to prevent production stoppages.  \n- Monitor entity statuses and warnings (e.g., \"out of fuel\", \"not receiving electricity\") to quickly identify and address operational issues.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
