{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal and depositing into a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two Stone Furnaces at positions (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected via a series of transport belts and a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt network.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore and depositing into a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items, transferring items between chests.\n\n### General Storage and Processing Area at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5) for storage, with a Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups connecting various parts of the map:\n- BeltGroup at positions such as (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5), (-18.5, -71.5) to (-16.5, -71.5), and others, facilitating the movement of resources across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. Check if the source entity is providing the necessary items and that the inserter is correctly positioned to pick them up.\n\n### AttributeError in BeltGroup\n- When accessing attributes of BeltGroup, ensure that the correct attributes are being referenced. BeltGroup objects do not have a 'direction' attribute; instead, check individual belts within the group for direction details."}
