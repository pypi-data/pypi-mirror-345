{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0), which extracts iron ore and is fueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, -48.5), which stores extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -48.5), which is aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is fueled with coal.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0), which is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest. Misalignment will prevent the inserter from picking up items.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Placement\n- Before placing an inserter, verify that there is no collision with existing entities. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources in your inventory before attempting to refuel or insert items into entities. For instance, make sure you have enough coal when refueling mining drills or inserters.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly configured to transfer materials to the furnace. Verify that the inserter is operational and correctly aligned to drop items into the furnace."}
