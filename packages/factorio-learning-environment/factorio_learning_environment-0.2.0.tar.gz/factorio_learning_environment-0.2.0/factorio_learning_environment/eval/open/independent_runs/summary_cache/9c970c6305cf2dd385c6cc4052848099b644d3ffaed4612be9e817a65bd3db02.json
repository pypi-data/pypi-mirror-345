{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) storing iron ore\n\n###Coal Mining Station at (24.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) storing coal\n\n###Copper Processing Line at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Initial wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) \n- Middle wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5)\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- First burner inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving items from initial chest to middle chest\n- Second burner inserter at (23.5, 21.5) moving items from middle chest to furnace\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) storing copper plates\n- Output burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n\n###Unused Furnaces\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth currently without ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Inserter Output Blocking Issues\n- Ensure there is a valid destination entity (like a chest or machine) at the drop position before placing inserters\n- Check that the inserter's drop position aligns with the input position of the destination machine\n\n###Furnace Operation Issues\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - verify the complete input chain is working (mining drill -> chest -> inserter -> furnace)\n- When furnace fuel inventory is full (50 coal), no need to add more fuel until it's consumed\n\n###Resource Flow Issues\n- Monitor chest inventories in production chains to identify bottlenecks\n- Ensure inserters are properly oriented to create a continuous flow of materials"}
