{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', status: NOT_CONNECTED.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel', status: NO_FUEL.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), status: WORKING.\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, including PipeGroup at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) and PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the attempt to insert coal into the boiler failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors related to disconnected fluid systems\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established and that there are no missing pipes or incorrect connections that could lead to warnings like 'no input liquid' or 'no fluid present in connections'.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in boilers\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in your boilers and ensure they are refueled to maintain operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `boiler`: Represents the boiler entity, type: Entity.\n  - `inventory`: Represents the current inventory, type: Dict[str, int]."}
