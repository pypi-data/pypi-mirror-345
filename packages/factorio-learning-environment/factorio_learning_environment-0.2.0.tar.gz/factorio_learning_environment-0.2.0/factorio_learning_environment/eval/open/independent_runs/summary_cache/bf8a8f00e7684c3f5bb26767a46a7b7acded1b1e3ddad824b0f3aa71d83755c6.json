{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with fuel (coal: 2), status: FULL_OUTPUT\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5), status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5), status: WORKING\n- Pipes connecting the boiler and steam engine, with connection points at (-7.5, 24.5) and (-3.5, 24.5)\n- Small Electric Poles in the vicinity, but not effectively connected to the steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0), status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0), status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0), status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5), status: NORMAL\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5), status: NO_POWER\n- Small Electric Poles around the inserter, not providing power\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, status: NO_POWER\n- Small Electric Poles nearby, not providing power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Steam Engine to Power Network\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network. Check for any blockages or misalignments in the pipe connections between the boiler and the steam engine.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly aligned and free from obstructions. Ensure that pipes are correctly placed and connected to facilitate the flow of water and steam.\n\n### Errors in Power Supply to Inserters and Labs\n- Ensure that all inserters and labs are connected to a functional power network. Check the placement and connectivity of small electric poles to ensure they are supplying power.\n\n### AssertionError: Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Confirm that the steam engine has a sufficient input of steam and is correctly connected to the power network. Address any warnings related to the steam engine, such as 'no input liquid' or 'no fluid present in connections'."}
