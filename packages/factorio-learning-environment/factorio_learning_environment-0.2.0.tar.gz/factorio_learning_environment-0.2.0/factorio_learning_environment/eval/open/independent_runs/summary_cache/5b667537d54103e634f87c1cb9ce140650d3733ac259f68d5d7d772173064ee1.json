{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) for coal collection\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) for iron ore collection\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (-10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\n\n### Copper Mining and Processing Setup at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) with chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Input chest at (22.5, 21.5)\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 22.5) moving items from input chest to furnace\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Variable Reference\n- Use correct variable names when checking entity types. 'BurnerMiningDrill' should be referenced as 'mining_drill'\n\n### Inserter Placement Issues\n- Ensure inserters are properly oriented and positioned relative to source and destination entities\n- Check that inserters have valid pickup and drop positions before placement\n\n### Entity Output Blocking\n- When placing inserters, ensure there is a valid destination entity to accept outputs\n- Current error shows inserter at (22.5, 22.5) has no valid destination for its output\n\n### Low Fuel Warnings\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills - some are running low on coal (e.g., drill at (-14.0, 23.0) has only 4 coal)\n- Consider implementing automatic refueling when coal levels drop below 10"}
