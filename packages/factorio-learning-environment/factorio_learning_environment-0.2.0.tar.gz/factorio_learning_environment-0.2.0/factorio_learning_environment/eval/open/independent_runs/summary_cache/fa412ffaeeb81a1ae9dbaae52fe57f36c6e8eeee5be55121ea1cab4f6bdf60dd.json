{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Assembly Line System at position(8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (x=8.5, y=13.5) for crafting automation science packs\n- Copper plate input system:\n  - Wooden chest (x=12.5, y=13.5) containing copper plates\n  - Two burner inserters in series (x=11.5, y=13.5 and x=10.5, y=13.5) to feed copper plates\n- Iron gear input system:\n  - Wooden chest (x=12.5, y=15.5) containing iron gears\n  - Burner inserter (x=11.5, y=15.5) to feed iron gears\n- Connected to power network via electric pole (x=8.5, y=15.5)\n\n###Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (x=-4.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler (x=-4.5, y=16.0) with coal fuel\n- Offshore pump (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Connected pipe networks for water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting power consumers\n\n###Mining and Smelting Outposts\nMultiple outposts with similar setup:\n1. First outpost at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest (x=-27.5, y=-59.5)\n   - Burner inserter (x=-26.5, y=-59.5)\n   - Stone furnace (x=-25.0, y=-59.0)\n   - Output inserter (x=-23.5, y=-58.5)\n   - Storage chest (x=-22.5, y=-58.5)\n\n2. Second outpost at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest (x=-17.5, y=-51.5)\n   - Burner inserter (x=-16.5, y=-51.5)\n   - Stone furnace (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n   - Output inserter (x=-13.5, y=-50.5)\n   - Storage chest (x=-12.5, y=-50.5)\n\n3. Coal mining outpost at (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Storage chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n   - Burner inserter (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement distance errors\n- Move closer to target location before attempting to place entities\n- Maximum placement distance is 10 units from player position\n\n### Entity collision errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Common colliding entities: transport belts, electric poles, inserters\n- Use different spacing or direction when placing near existing structures\n\n### Inserter placement optimization\n- Ensure proper orientation of inserters relative to target machines\n- Consider the input/output positions of assembling machines when placing inserters\n- Leave adequate space between inserters in series\n\n### Power system management\n- Keep boilers fueled to maintain consistent power supply\n- Ensure proper connection of all electrical entities to the power network\n\n### Resource management\n- Monitor input chest inventory levels\n- Ensure consistent supply of materials to assembling machines\n- Set up proper input/output flows with correct inserter configurations"}
