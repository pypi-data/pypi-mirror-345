{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace and Inserter Setup at Position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0) with status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Inserter at position (x=16.5, y=0.5) with status: NO_POWER\n- Inserter at position (x=17.5, y=0.5) with status: NO_POWER\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=18.5, y=0.5) with status: NORMAL\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=5.5, y=0.5) with status: NORMAL\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following pipe groups:\n- Pipe Group at position (x=-12.5, y=18.5) with status: EMPTY\n- Pipe Group at position (x=-11.5, y=19.5) with status: EMPTY\n- Pipe Group at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5) with status: EMPTY\n- Pipe Group at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status: EMPTY\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following electricity group:\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, including (x=4.5, y=2.5), (x=-4.5, y=7.5), (x=14.5, y=1.5), (x=-12.5, y=24.5), and (x=10.5, y=1.5). Current status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump at (x=-9.5, y=24.5) and the boiler at (x=-5.5, y=25.0).\n- Verify that the pipe connections from the boiler at (x=-5.5, y=25.0) to the steam engine at (x=-12.5, y=24.5) are properly established.\n\n### Electricity Network Issues\n- Confirm that all components of the electricity network are correctly connected to the electric network to avoid the NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK status.\n- Ensure that inserters at positions (x=16.5, y=0.5) and (x=17.5, y=0.5) are connected to a power source to avoid the NO_POWER status."}
