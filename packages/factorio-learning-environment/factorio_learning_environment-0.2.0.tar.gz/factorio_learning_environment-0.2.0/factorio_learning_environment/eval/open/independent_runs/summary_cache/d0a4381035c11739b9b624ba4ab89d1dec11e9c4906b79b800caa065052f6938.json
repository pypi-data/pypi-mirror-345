{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation and Distribution Network\n- **Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)**\n  - Consists of a steam engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5), a boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0), and an offshore pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5).\n  - Connected via a pipe network with water pipes at positions [(x=-3.5, y=26.5), (x=-2.5, y=26.5), (x=-1.5, y=26.5), (x=-1.5, y=27.5), (x=-1.5, y=28.5)] and steam pipes at positions [(x=1.5, y=26.5), (x=0.5, y=26.5), (x=3.5, y=26.5), ..., (x=10.5, y=29.5), (x=10.5, y=31.5), (x=10.5, y=30.5)].\n  - Electricity distribution network expanded with poles at positions [(x=7.5, y=17.5), (x=13.5, y=27.5), (x=7.5, y=9.5), ..., (x=9.5, y=23.5), (x=16.5, y=31.5), (x=12.5, y=34.5)].\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing\n- **Coal Mining Site at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)**\n  - Includes a burner mining drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for coal collection.\n  - Additional wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) and burner inserters at positions (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for transferring coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- **Iron Plate Storage at Positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5)**\n  - Iron chests containing coal and iron plates for storage and further processing.\n\n### Belt System\n- **Belt System for Coal Transport**\n  - BeltGroup with inputs and outputs at positions [(x=50.5, y=-86.5) -> (x=48.5, y=-86.5)] and [(x=49.5, y=-86.5) -> (x=47.5, y=-86.5)].\n  - Additional belts at positions [(x=43.5, y=-84.5) -> (x=45.5, y=-84.5)] and [(x=45.5, y=-85.5) -> (x=47.5, y=-85.5)].\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe and Electricity Connections\n- **No Pipe Group Found**\n  - Ensure that all required pipes are connected properly to form a complete network. Check for missing connections or misaligned pipes.\n  \n- **No Electricity Group Found**\n  - Verify that all power poles are connected correctly and that there are no gaps in the electricity network. Ensure that all entities needing power are within range of a power pole.\n\n### General Tips for Avoiding Errors\n- Regularly check the status of all entities to ensure they are operating correctly and have the necessary resources.\n- Keep an eye on warnings and error messages for quick troubleshooting and resolution.\n- Ensure that all entities are placed correctly and that their connections (pipes, belts, power poles) are complete and functional."}
