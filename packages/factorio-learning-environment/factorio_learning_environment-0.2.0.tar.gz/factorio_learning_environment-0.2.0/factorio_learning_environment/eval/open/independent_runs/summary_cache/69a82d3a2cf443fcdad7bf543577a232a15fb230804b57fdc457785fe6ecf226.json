{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to a furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. Misalignment will prevent the inserter from picking up items correctly.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position to ensure proper item transfer.\n\n### Inserter Fueling Errors\n- Always check that the inserter has sufficient fuel before attempting to operate it. Refuel the inserter with coal as necessary to maintain operation.\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Confirm that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Ensure that iron ore is being successfully transferred to the furnace for smelting into iron plates.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Running out of coal will halt operations that require it."}
