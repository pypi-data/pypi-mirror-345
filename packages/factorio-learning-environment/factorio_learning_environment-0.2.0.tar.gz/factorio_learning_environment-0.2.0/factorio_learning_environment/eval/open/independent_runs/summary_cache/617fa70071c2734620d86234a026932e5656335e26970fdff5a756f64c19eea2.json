{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but all attempts have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and inserters have failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors with movement and pathfinding\n- When moving to a new position, ensure that the path is valid and the destination is reachable. Errors indicate issues with pathfinding, such as \"Could not get path\" and \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\".\n\n### General placement errors\n- Review the coordinates and ensure they are within a valid buildable area. Multiple placement attempts failed across different coordinates, suggesting potential issues with the selected positions."}
