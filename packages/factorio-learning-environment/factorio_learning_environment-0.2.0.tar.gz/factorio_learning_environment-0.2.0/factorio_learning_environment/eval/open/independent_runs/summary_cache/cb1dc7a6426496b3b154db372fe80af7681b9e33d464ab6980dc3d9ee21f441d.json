{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (10, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (1, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Chest (wooden-chest) at position (3.5, 1.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (8.5, 1.5)\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (10.0, 1.0)\n\n### Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections to the offshore pump at positions (-9.5, 23.5) and (-9.5, 22.5)\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at positions (39.5, 32.5), (43.5, 32.5), (47.5, 32.5), (52.5, 49.0), (52.5, 54.0), (55.5, 54.5), (55.5, 55.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that is unplaceable (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors when trying to get entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to access actually exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. In this case, ensure that a steam engine is present at position (10.0, 0.0) before calling `get_entity`.\n\n### Errors when removing blocking entities\n- If you are repeatedly encountering issues with blocking entities, consider checking the layout of your structures to avoid placing them in areas where they may obstruct future constructions."}
