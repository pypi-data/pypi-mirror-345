Check the surrounding area for any entities that might obstruct the connection.\n\n### AttributeError with PipeGroup\n- Avoid using attributes that do not exist for certain objects. In this case, the 'direction' attribute does not exist for PipeGroup objects. Check the API documentation for valid attributes before attempting to access them."}
