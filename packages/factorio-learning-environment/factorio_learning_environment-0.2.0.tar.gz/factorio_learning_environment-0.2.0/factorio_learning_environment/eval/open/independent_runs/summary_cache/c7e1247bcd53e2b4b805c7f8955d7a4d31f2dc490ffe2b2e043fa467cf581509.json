{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) and (x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-3.5, y=26.0)\n- Steam engine (generator) at position (x=35.5, y=27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components, including pipes at positions (x=-8.0, y=24.5), (x=-7.0, y=24.5), (x=-6.0, y=24.5), and (x=-5.0, y=24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnaces at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=10.0, y=0.0), (x=13.0, y=0.0), and (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden chests at positions (x=8.5, y=-0.5), (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), (x=20.5, y=-0.5), and (x=8.5, y=1.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Research Lab at Position (x=8.5, y=0.5)\n- Lab with no power, positioned at (x=8.5, y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Offshore Pump Connection Issues\n- Ensure that offshore pumps are properly connected to the pipe network to supply water to the boilers.\n\n### Boiler Verification Failures\n- Verify that boilers are correctly connected to the water supply and have coal as fuel.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Steam\n- Check connections between the boiler and steam engine to ensure steam is being transferred.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that the required items (e.g., iron ore) are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces or chests.\n\n### Lab Placement Errors\n- Move closer to the desired position before attempting to place a lab, ensuring it is within the maximum allowable distance.\n- Ensure a lab is available in the inventory before attempting to place one.\n\n### Extracting Items from Non-Existent Entities\n- Verify the existence and contents of entities (e.g., stone furnaces) before attempting to extract items from them."}
