{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at x=-9.5 y=-0.5\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. The boiler was refueled in step 25. The steam engine remains unconnected to any power network and is therefore not producing usable electricity.\n-   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water.\n-   **Boiler** at position (x=-5.0, y=2.5): Heats water into steam using coal. Currently has fuel.\n-   **Steam Engine** at position (x=0.5, y=6.5): Consumes steam to generate electricity. (Note: Currently not connected to any power network).\n-   **PipeGroup** connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler: Consists of pipes at [(x=-8.5,y=-0.5),(x=-7.5,y=-0.5),(x=-6.5,y=0.5),(x=-7.5,y=0.5),(x=-5.5,y=0.5)].\n-   **PipeGroup** connecting Boiler to Steam Engine: Consists of pipes at [(x=-3.5,y=3.5),(x=-3.5,y=2.5),(x=-2.5,y=5.5),(x=-3.5,y=5.5),(x=-3.5,y=4.5),(x=-2.5,y=6.5)].\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Pumpjack Placement Errors\n-   Multiple attempts to find a valid placement for a Pumpjack near crude oil patches failed repeatedly (Steps 8, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28), even when searching different patch areas and large bounding boxes.\n-   The error messages in steps 18, 21, and 28 explicitly state that no valid position could be found within the *entire* searched bounding box, despite logs indicating thousands of tiles were checked. The error message in step 28 specifically reports checking 0 tiles.\n-   Review the placement search logic:\n    -   Ensure it correctly identifies tiles that are both buildable *and* contain crude oil suitable for a Pumpjack's center tile.\n    -   Verify that the `can_place_entity` check considers the Pumpjack's dimensions (3x3) and required clear space.\n    -   Investigate the discrepancy where error messages report checking 0 tiles, while logs show thousands were checked. This might point to a bug in the tile checking loop or the error reporting itself.\n\n### Timeout Error\n-   A timeout error occurred during step 11 after refueling the boiler. This might indicate the agent took too long for a specific operation or the overall step execution exceeded the allowed time limit. Consider optimizing the actions within a step"}
