{"content": "Here is the updated report:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Primary Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 0.5) - Water source (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Boiler** at (0.0, 0.5) - Steam production (fueled with coal, status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Steam engine** at (6.5, 0.5) - Power generation (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Underground belt** at (1.5, 0.5) - Partial connection attempt\n- Missing pipe connections between components\n\n### Remote Production Outpost (Unchanged)\n- **Assembling machine 2** at (50.5, 50.5) - Circuit production (no power)\n- **Wooden chests** at (48.5, 50.5) and (52.5, 50.5) - Empty storage\n- Connected to power pole at (49.5, 48.5)\n\n### Mining Operations (Unchanged)\n- Iron drill at (15.5, 70.5) - Output still blocked\n- Copper drill at (-46.5, 70.5) - Output still blocked\n- Associated furnaces at (16.0, 74.0) and (-46.0, 74.0) - Inactive\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Collisions (Critical)\n- 12+ failed placement attempts due to:\n  1. Existing objects in target positions\n  2. Incorrect position validation\n- Required solutions:\n  1. Implement clear_entity() before rebuilds\n  2. Use get_colliding_entities() pre-check\n  3. Maintain build area cleanup\n\n### API Usage Errors (Severe)\n- Persistent prototype reference errors:\n  1. Incorrect Prototype.PipeToGround reference\n  2. Confusing underground-belt with pipe-to-ground\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Verify all prototype names in documentation\n  2. Implement type checking wrappers\n  3. Use correct entity types for fluid vs item transport\n\n### Power System Design (Persistent)\n- Repeated partial builds with connection failures\n- Critical issues:\n  1. Broken pipe connections\n  2. Unverified fluid systems\n  3. Mismatched component types\n- Design requirements:\n  1. Complete one subsystem before proceeding\n  2. Verify all connection points\n  3. Use consistent transport types (pipes vs belts)\n\n### Position Validation (Ongoing)\n- Multiple millimeter-precision placement failures\n- Required improvements:\n  1. Use integer grid coordinates\n  2. Implement position snapping\n  3. Validate against entity dimensions\n\n### Previous Unresolved Issues\n- Mining drill outputs still blocked\n- Remote assembler remains unpowered\n- Primary power plant incomplete\n- No functional production lines\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `find_clear_land_near_power()` -> Position\n  - Still failing due to undefined dependencies\n  - Needs terrain validation implementation\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler`: Primary steam producer at (0.0, 0.5)\n- `steam_engine`: Power generator at (6.5, 0.5)\n- `underground_belt`: Misplaced connector at (1.5, 0.5)"}
