{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump and steam engine, starting at position (-46.5, -122.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) for storing mined iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storing iron plates\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items from the furnace to the chest\n- Small Electric Poles for power distribution, starting at position (5.5, -60.5)\n\n### Laboratory Setup\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Error\n- Ensure the steam engine is properly connected to both the power network and a source of steam. Check connections for any missing pipes or incorrect placements.\n\n### Boiler Placement Error\n- Before placing a boiler, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. Clear any existing objects or choose a different location to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply Error\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the proximity and connections of small electric poles to the inserters to ensure they receive electricity.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Fuel Error\n- Regularly check the fuel status of burner mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Refill fuel as necessary to avoid stoppages.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Supply Error\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to smelt. Check input inventories and supply lines to maintain production flow."}
