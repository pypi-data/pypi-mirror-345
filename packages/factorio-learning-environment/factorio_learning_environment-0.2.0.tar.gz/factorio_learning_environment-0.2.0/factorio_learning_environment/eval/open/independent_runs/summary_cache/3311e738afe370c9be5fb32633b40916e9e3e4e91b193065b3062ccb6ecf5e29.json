If inserters are waiting for items, check the connected belts or furnaces for output.\n- Example: Inserters at (x=12.5, y=-59.5) and (x=4.5, y=-57.5) are waiting for items to transfer.\n\n#### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and the required ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to operate.\n- Example: Furnaces at (x=4.0, y=-60.0) and (x=6.0, y=-60.0) have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n#### Errors with Mining Drills Running Out of Fuel"}
