{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at position (2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 \u2022 Input Chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5) serving as the factory interface  \n\u2013 \u2022 Burner Inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) placed using direction RIGHT  \n\u2013 \u2022 Assembling Machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5) connected as a production neighbour\n\n### Depot Belt Network at position (3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 \u2022 Wooden Chest at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) serving as the belt depot  \n\u2013 \u2022 Transport Belt Segment at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) adjacent to the depot chest  \n\u2013 \u2022 Depot Burner Inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) placed with direction UP adjacent to the chest\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-0.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 \u2022 Steam Engine (Generator) at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)  \n\u2013 \u2022 Boiler at Position(x=-5.5, y=24.0)  \n\u2013 \u2022 Offshore Pump at Position(x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2013 When connecting transport belts, avoid selecting a Prototype.SteamEngine as the target. Instead, add and use an inserter that inputs items into the steam engine to ensure proper belt connection.\n\u2013 Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is within the allowed range relative to the player\u2019s current location to prevent placement distance errors.\n\u2013 Confirm that the required inventory items (for example, a wooden chest) are available prior to attempting placement.\n\u2013 Ensure that all variables (such as one used for target chest assignment) are defined before reference, to prevent NameError issues."}
