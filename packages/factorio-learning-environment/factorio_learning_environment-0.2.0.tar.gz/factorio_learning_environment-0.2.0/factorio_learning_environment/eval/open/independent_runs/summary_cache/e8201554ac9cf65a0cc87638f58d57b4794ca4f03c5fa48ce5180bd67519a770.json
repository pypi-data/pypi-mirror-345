{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting these entities, including positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), and others\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for transferring materials\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles forming a network at various positions including (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (5.5, -59.5), and others\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at Position (not specified) with input for automation science packs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities with Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities with small electric poles. The connection failed due to a lack of small electric poles in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Verify that inserters are properly connected to a power source. The inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) is not receiving electricity, indicating a possible issue with the power connection.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The stone furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) has a warning of no ingredients to smelt, which halts production."}
