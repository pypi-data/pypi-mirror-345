{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The boiler is currently not connected to any fluid system and has warnings for no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5), which is also not connected to any fluid system and has warnings for no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel and a warning for no ingredients to smelt. It currently holds copper plates as the result.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel and a warning for no ingredients to smelt. It currently holds iron plates as the result.\n\n### Additional Furnace\n- Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel and a warning for no ingredients to smelt. It currently holds no result.\n\n### Inserter Setup\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) with a warning for not receiving electricity. It is connected to small electric poles and a wooden chest.\n\n### Storage Chests\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) with an empty inventory.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, all with status EMPTY, indicating no fluid is present.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, currently with no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before attempting to place a pipe. Verify the target location is clear for placement.\n\n### Offshore Pump Connection Error\n- Connect the offshore pump to a fluid system to ensure proper operation. Verify all necessary connections are made to establish a fluid system.\n\n### Inserter Power Error\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the connection to small electric poles and verify the power supply."}
