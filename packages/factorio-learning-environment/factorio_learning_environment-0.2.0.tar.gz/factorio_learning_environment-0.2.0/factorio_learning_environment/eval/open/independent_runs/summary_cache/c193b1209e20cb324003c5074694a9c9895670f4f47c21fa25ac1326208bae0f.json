{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to mine and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning indicates persistent alignment issues.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel the inserter and furnace to prevent them from running out of fuel, which halts operations.\n\n### Chest Full Error\n- Monitor the chest's capacity to avoid it becoming full, which stops the mining drill from depositing more iron ore. Regularly extract items from the chest to maintain space.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Ensure the furnace is receiving iron ore from the inserter. If the furnace is not receiving materials, verify the inserter's alignment and functionality.\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep an eye on the inventory levels of essential resources like coal and iron ore to ensure continuous operation of the structures."}
