{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nComplex automated coal mining and transport system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Input storage iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) holding mined coal\n- Intermediate wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for coal storage\n- Transport belt (x=42.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Furnace inserter (x=43.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - Primary furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n  - Secondary furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage (x=49.5, y=-80.5)\n- Wooden chest containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Belt group running from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5 at x=42.5\n- Additional belts at:\n  - (x=42.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT\n  - (x=42.5, y=-79.5) facing DOWN\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other objects\n- Error seen when trying to place burner-inserter at (41.5, -81.5) due to existing object\n\n2. System Design Issues\n- Multiple attempts to adjust inserter placement and direction indicate need for better initial planning\n- Consider mapping out complete system design before placing components\n- Pay attention to inserter pickup/drop positions relative to other components\n\n3. Resource Management\n- Several components show \"chest is full\" warnings\n- Consider implementing overflow protection or larger storage solutions\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices (mining drill showing relatively low fuel at 26 coal)\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- furnace: Furnace\n- belt: TransportBelt\n\nSystem States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Seen on mining drill\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Common on inserters\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Seen on furnaces\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Default state for chests\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: Seen on belt systems"}
