{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), fueled by coal, actively mining iron ore and transferring it to nearby chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5), used for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), responsible for transferring iron ore from chests to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0), used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Both furnaces currently lack ingredients to smelt.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5), used for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring iron ore from the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to another chest at (-14.5, -46.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5), storing transferred iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-11.5, -46.5) and (-11.5, -45.5), responsible for transferring iron plates between furnaces and chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -47.5) and (-7.5, -47.5), currently empty, intended for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) contains items to be transferred by the inserter. Regularly check and maintain the supply of items to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly supply stone furnaces with the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to ensure continuous smelting. Monitor the input chests and maintain a steady flow of resources to the furnaces.\n\n### Efficient Fuel Management\n- Monitor the fuel levels of burner entities (e.g., mining drills, inserters) to avoid interruptions in production. Refuel them promptly to maintain efficiency.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of inventory levels in chests to prevent overflow or underutilization. Ensure that there is enough storage capacity for produced items to avoid production halts."}
