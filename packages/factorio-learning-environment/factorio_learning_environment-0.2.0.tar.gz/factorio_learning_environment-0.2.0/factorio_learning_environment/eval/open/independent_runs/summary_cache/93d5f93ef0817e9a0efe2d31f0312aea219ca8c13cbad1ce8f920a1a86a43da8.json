{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Processing Unit at position(61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at (61.0, -54.0) functioning as the smelting facility.\n- Wooden Chest serving as storage at (62.5, -53.5) placed adjacent to the furnace.\n- Furnace Output Inserter placed at (63.5, -53.5) that extracts items from the furnace.\n- Secondary Furnace Output Inserter placed at (61.5, -55.5) with a pickup position at (61.5, -54.5) and a drop position at (61.5, -56.5).\n- Chest Input Inserters including one placed at (62.5, -52.5) and a repositioned unit at (62.5, -50.5) with pickup positions at (62.5, -51.5) and (62.5, -49.5) respectively.\n- Belt Groups intended to connect output drop positions to the chest input pickup positions, though connections failed due to missing items.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of:\n- Smelting facility for coal, stone, and iron ore.\n- Converts iron ore into iron plates for further crafting processes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Inserting inserters into occupied positions: Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position when an entity already exists at the target location (as occurred with the burner-inserter placement near the wooden chest).\n- Connecting entities with transport belts: Ensure inventory contains the required transport belt items before attempting a connection, as multiple connection errors indicate missing items.\n- Crafting additional items: Verify that sufficient ingredients are available in the inventory prior to initiating crafting operations to avoid failures during production.\n"}
