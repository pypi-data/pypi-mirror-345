{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0) to (-11.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)**: Currently in status `FULL_OUTPUT` with warnings indicating that the furnace result is full. It is fueled with coal and has an inventory of iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)**: Also in status `FULL_OUTPUT` with similar warnings about full output. It is fueled with coal and contains iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)**: Status is `NO_INGREDIENTS` with warnings about no ingredients to smelt. It is fueled with coal and has a nearly full inventory of iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0) to (4.5, -58.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0)**: Status is `WORKING` with warnings about the chest at the drop position being full. It is fueled with coal and extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5)**: This chest is used for storing extracted iron ore and is currently full.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Related to Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the output of furnaces is regularly cleared to prevent them from reaching a `FULL_OUTPUT` status. This can be done by extracting the produced items or setting up an automated system to transport them away.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chest at Mining Drill Drop Position\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill to prevent it from stopping due to a full inventory. Consider setting up additional storage or transport systems to handle excess resources.\n\n### Errors from Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to prevent them from reaching a `NO_INGREDIENTS` status. This can be managed by setting up automated supply lines or manually refilling them as needed.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `Inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the player's inventory, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
