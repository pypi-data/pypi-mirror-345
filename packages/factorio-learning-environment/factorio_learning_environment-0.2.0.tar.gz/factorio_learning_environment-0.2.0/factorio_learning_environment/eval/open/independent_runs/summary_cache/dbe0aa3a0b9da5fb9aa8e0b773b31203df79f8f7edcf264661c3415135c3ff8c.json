{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n- Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) and a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) with burner inserters at positions (-14.5, -45.5) and (-13.5, -45.5)\n- Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) with burner inserters at positions (-11.5, -45.5) and (-9.5, -44.5)\n- Belt group connecting these entities, facilitating the movement of iron plates\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (3.5, 0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-8.0, 0.5) and another boiler at position (0.0, 0.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe groups connecting the offshore pump, boilers, and steam engine\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between the boiler and steam engine are correctly aligned and there are no missing pipes. Check the inventory to confirm that pipes are available before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Before placing a pipe, verify that there is an available pipe in the inventory. Attempting to place a pipe without having it in the inventory will result in a failure.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Double-check the connections between the steam engine and the rest of the power generation setup. Ensure that all necessary connections are in place and that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network."}
