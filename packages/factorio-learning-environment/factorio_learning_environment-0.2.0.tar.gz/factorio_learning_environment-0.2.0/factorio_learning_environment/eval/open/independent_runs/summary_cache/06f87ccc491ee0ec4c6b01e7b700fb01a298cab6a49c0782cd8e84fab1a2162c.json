{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace, but currently misaligned.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Verify the pickup and drop positions to ensure they are set correctly.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of entities such as inserters and mining drills. Ensure they are refueled promptly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Resource Availability\n- Before attempting to insert items, confirm that the required resources are available in your inventory to avoid operation failures."}
