{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) and another Wooden Chest at position (54.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5), and a Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0).\n\n### Copper Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 0.0).\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using callable objects incorrectly\n- Ensure that you are using the correct method to interact with entities. For example, avoid trying to call a 'Chest' object as if it were a function.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting due to lack of space.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function properly. Check the inventory of connected entities and ensure they are not empty.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in mining drills\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel."}
