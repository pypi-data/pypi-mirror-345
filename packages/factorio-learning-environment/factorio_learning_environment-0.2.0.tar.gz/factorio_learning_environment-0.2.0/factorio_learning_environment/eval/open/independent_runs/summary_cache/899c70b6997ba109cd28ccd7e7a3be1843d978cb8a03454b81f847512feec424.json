Although several attempts were made to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) and to craft it for supplying Automation Science Packs, none of these operations resulted in a new structure. All queries for entities returned \u201cNone,\u201d and the furnaces used for smelting were only retrieved rather than constructed in this execution.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Errors when calling get_entities:\n  \u2013 Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or supplying incorrect numbers of positional arguments. Always verify the API\u2019s required parameters before invoking the function.\n  \n\u2022 Errors when placing objects:\n  \u2013 Ensure that the required item (e.g., Lab) is present in the inventory before attempting placement on a specific tile.\n  \n\u2022 Errors due to unvalidated function outputs:\n  \u2013 Check that functions like get_entities return a valid iterable rather than None before performing operations such as iteration.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting prerequisite errors:\n  \u2013 Confirm that all sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels and electronic-circuits) and their resource chains are fully available. Verify that the necessary crafting machines or furnaces are operational so that intermediate products (like iron plates and copper plates) can be produced.\n  \n\u2022 Insufficient resource errors:\n  \u2013 Double-check ingredient counts and dependencies before reattempting lab crafting; missing components indicate that either resource levels or production capabilities need to be improved before proceeding."}
