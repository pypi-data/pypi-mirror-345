{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Structure at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (16.0, 71.0) \n- Burner Inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) \n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) \n- Burner Inserter at position (16.5, 74.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n#### Errors when placing entities without having the required items in inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items with insufficient ingredients or incorrect crafting setup\n- Ensure you have the necessary ingredients and a suitable crafting machine or furnace for the item you are trying to craft.\n\n#### Errors when accessing or manipulating non-existent entities\n- Check if the entity exists before attempting to access or manipulate it.\n\n#### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before they are used in your code.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities into occupied positions\n- Ensure the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nHowever, here are some important variables that have been assigned:\n- `output_inserter`: an inserter entity, type: `Entity`\n- `output_chest`: an iron chest entity, type: `Entity` (attempted to be placed but failed)\n- `Prototype.IronChest`: a prototype for iron chest, type: `Prototype`\n- `Prototype.WoodenChest`: a prototype for wooden chest, type: `Prototype` (used in the latest step)\n\nThese variables are related to the attempts to place chests and inserters. The repeated failures to define and place `output_chest` suggest issues with crafting chests and accessing entities that do not exist. The latest attempt to place a wooden chest at the drop position of `output_inserter` failed due to the position being occupied."}
