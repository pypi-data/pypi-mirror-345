{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) used for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore between chests.\n  - At position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the output chest.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - At position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates from iron ore.\n  - At position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates from iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that there is a continuous supply of source items for inserters to avoid idle time. Check the inventory of chests and mining drills to maintain a steady flow of resources.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination for inserters, such as furnaces or chests, has enough space to receive items. Regularly extract items from destination entities to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Having Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities for inserters, such as chests or mining drills, are adequately stocked with items to be transferred. Regular checks and refueling of mining drills can help maintain the flow of resources."}
