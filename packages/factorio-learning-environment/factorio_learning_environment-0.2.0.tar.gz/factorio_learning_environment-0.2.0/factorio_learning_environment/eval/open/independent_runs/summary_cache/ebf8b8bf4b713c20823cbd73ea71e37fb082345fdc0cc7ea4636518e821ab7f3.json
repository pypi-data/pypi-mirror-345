{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), fueled by coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storage of extracted resources.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0), fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring items between entities, currently facing issues with space in the destination.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0), fueled by coal, intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates but currently lacking ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5), intended to transfer items but currently waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) for storage of resources.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items into full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. Consider extracting or transferring items to free up space.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for insertion\n- Verify that the required resources are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities.\n\n### Errors related to inserter operations\n- Check that the inserters have a clear path and destination to transfer items. Ensure that the destination has space and that the source has items available to transfer.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted.\n\nThese tips should help in optimizing the setup and reducing errors in the operation of your structures."}
