Ensure the connection routine uses the current fluid_system identifiers (e.g. 101206 for the primary network) and verify that a corresponding pipe group exists within the required radius before attempting a connection.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Attribute Usage:\n  - Use only supported inventory attributes when accessing or modifying inventory items.\n\n\u2022 Consistency in Connection Parameters:\n  - Verify that fluid_system identifiers and connection parameters match the updated map configuration to prevent mismatches during pipe group lookups."}
