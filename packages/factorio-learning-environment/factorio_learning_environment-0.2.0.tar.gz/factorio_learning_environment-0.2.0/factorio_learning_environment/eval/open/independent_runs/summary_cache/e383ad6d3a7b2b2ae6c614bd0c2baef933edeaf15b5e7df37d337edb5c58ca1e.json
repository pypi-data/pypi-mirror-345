{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal and operational, extracting iron ore.\n  - Neighbors: Wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5).\n  - Status: Working, but with a warning that the chest at drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Used for storing extracted iron ore.\n  - Chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) contains iron ore.\n  - Chest at (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) is empty.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Contains iron ore and has produced iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Transfers items between chests.\n  - Refueled with coal and operational, waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is free of other entities before placing a new entity. In the case of the error at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), the presence of a wooden chest prevented the placement of a burner inserter. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid such conflicts.\n\n### Warnings due to full storage\n- Regularly check and clear storage chests to prevent mining operations from halting. The burner mining drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) issued a warning because the chest at the drop position was full. Ensure that chests are emptied or additional storage is provided to maintain continuous operation."}
