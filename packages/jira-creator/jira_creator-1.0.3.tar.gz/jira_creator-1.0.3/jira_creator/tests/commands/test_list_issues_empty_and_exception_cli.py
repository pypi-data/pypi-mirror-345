"""
This file contains unit tests for the 'list_issues' method in the 'cli' module.
It includes tests for the scenarios where the list of issues is empty and when an exception is raised.
Mocking of the 'list_issues' method is done using MagicMock to control its behavior during testing.
The tests verify the expected output messages when listing issues fails or when no issues are found.

Functions:
- test_list_issues_empty(cli, capsys): Mocks the list_issues method of a Jira CLI object to return an empty list for
testing purposes.
- test_list_issues_fail(cli, capsys): Simulates a failure scenario for listing issues in Jira.

Arguments:
- cli: A Jira CLI object.
- capsys: Pytest fixture to capture stdout and stderr output.

Exceptions:
- ListIssuesError: Raised when an error occurs while listing Jira issues.

Side Effects:
- Modifies the behavior of the list_issues method of the provided Jira CLI object.
- Modifies the behavior of the 'list_issues' method in the Jira command line interface to raise a 'ListIssuesError'
with message "fail".
