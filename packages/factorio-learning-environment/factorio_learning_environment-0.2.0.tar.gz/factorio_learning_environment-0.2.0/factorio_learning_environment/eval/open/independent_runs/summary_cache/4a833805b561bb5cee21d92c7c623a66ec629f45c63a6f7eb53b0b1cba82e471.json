{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with iron ore supply and full output of iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) with pickup position (-13.5, -48.5) and drop position (-13.5, -46.5).\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) with pickup position (-14.5, -46.5) and drop position (-14.5, -44.5).\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -44.5) with pickup position (-8.5, -44.5) and drop position (-10.5, -44.5).\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -43.5) with pickup position (-14.5, -44.5) and drop position (-14.5, -42.5).\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5).\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) with inventory of iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) with inventory of iron ore.\n- **Belt Groups**:\n  - BeltGroup connecting various positions to facilitate movement of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter's drop position has enough space to accommodate the items being inserted. Consider adding more storage or clearing the existing storage to avoid blockage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source position for the inserter has the necessary items available for pickup. Ensure continuous supply of materials to prevent idle inserters.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients\n- Regularly check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients for smelting. Ensure a steady supply chain feeding into the furnace to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from inserters. Clear any items blocking the output path to prevent production halts."}
