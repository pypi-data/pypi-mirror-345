You need to add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.SteamEngine and use the inserter as the target entity.\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Tip: Always verify that the target for belt connections is not a steam engine. Use an intermediary inserter to properly feed items into power-generating components.\n\n\u2022 Wooden Chest Placement Errors  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Distance Error: \u201cCould not place wooden-chest at (3.5, 15.5), The target position is too far away\u2026\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002\u2003Tip: Move closer to the target tile before attempting placement to stay within the maximum placement distance.  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Inventory Error: \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory.\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002\u2003Tip: Ensure the required item is available in inventory prior to executing the placement command.  \n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Variable Name Error: \u201cNameError: name 'target_chest' is not defined\u2026\u201d  \n\u2002\u2002\u2003Tip: Use correct and defined variable names (e.g. target_pos or depot_chest) to avoid undefined variable errors."}
