Remove, reposition, or adjust interfering entities, or alternatively, relocate the extra steam engine to a dedicated area with sufficient spacing or modify the boiler layout to enhance clearance.\n\n\u2022 Burner Fuel Supply Issues\n  \u2013 Multiple burner\u2011inserters and mining drills are reporting fuel shortages (NO_FUEL and WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS), which disrupt continuous operation.\n  \u2013 Mitigation: Ensure that fuel sources are optimally positioned adjacent to burner entities to secure a steady supply of fuel.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connectivity Problems\n  \u2013 Several steam engines generate warnings such as \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d, \u201cno input liquid\u201d and \u201cno fluid present in connections.\u201d\n  \u2013 Mitigation: Reexamine and adjust the electrical wiring and fluid pipe alignments for each steam engine to confirm that all connection points are clear and properly integrated with the power and fluid systems.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Deficiency\n  \u2013 The Automation Research Lab remains without a stable power connection, hindering its research output.\n  \u2013 Mitigation: Reevaluate the configuration and placement of nearby electrical poles and wiring to deliver a consistent and reliable power supply to the lab."}
