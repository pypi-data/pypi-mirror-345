{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) with fuel (coal) and currently operational. It has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5) where it deposits mined resources into a wooden chest.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) which is currently working with iron ore as its input. The furnace has a status indicating it is operational and is producing iron plates.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) which is receiving coal from the burner mining drill. The chest currently has a limited inventory of coal.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (-15.5, -50.5)) which is used to extract iron ore from the surrounding area.\n- A furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) that processes the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace**: \n  - Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace. The error indicates that there was no iron ore available to insert.\n  \n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**: \n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: \n  - Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `insert_item(item, target, quantity)`: Used to insert items into a target entity. \n    - **Failure Mode**: Fails when the item is not available in the inventory.\n    - **Success Mode**: Successfully inserts the specified quantity of the item into the target.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `furnace`: Entity (Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0))\n  - `quantity`: Integer (number of items to insert, e.g., 4)\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary (current inventory contents, e.g., {'wood': 6, 'coal': 2991, 'iron-plate': 721})"}
