{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0,0)\nConsists of four furnaces arranged in a grid:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0) \n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients but contain some produced iron plates\n\n### Automated Iron Mining & Smelting at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) for direct smelting\nCurrently drill is working but blocked due to full output, furnace has no ingredients but contains iron plates\n\n### Automated Copper Mining & Smelting at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) for direct smelting\nCurrently drill is working but blocked due to full output, furnace is working with copper ore and producing copper plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- When placing a furnace or other entity, ensure you have the required item in inventory first\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Check inventory for required fuel (coal) before attempting to insert it into entities\n- Monitor furnace and drill outputs to prevent blockages:\n  - Drills are showing \"waiting for space in destination\" warnings\n  - Need to regularly extract products from furnaces to maintain production flow\n\n### Extraction Issues\n- Verify target entity exists and contains the desired item before attempting extraction\n- Ensure correct entity coordinates when attempting to extract items\n\n### Resource Collection Workflow\n- Maintain adequate coal supplies for fueling multiple entities\n- Keep track of furnace contents to optimize extraction timing"}
