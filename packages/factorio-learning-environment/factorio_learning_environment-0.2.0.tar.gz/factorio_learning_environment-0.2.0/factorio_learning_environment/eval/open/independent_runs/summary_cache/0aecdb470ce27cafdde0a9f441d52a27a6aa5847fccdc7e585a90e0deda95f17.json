{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=52.5, y=-84.5)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal.\n- A Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) stores extracted coal.\n\n#### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0)\n- Includes a Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Connected to a BeltGroup that transports ore from position (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-65.5).\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- A Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) stores extracted iron ore.\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\n- Includes a Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- A Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transfers items from the furnace to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5).\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Includes a Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- A Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) is set to transfer items from a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors due to Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination container has enough space to receive items from inserters. Consider using larger storage or multiple chests to prevent blockage.\n\n#### Errors due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Make sure the furnaces have the necessary ingredients for smelting. Check the supply chain to ensure raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n#### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source container has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure the supply chain is not interrupted and resources are consistently available."}
