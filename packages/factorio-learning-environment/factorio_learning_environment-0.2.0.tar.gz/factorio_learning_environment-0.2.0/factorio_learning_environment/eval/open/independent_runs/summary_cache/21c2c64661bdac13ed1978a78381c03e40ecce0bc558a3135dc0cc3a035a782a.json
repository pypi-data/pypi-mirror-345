{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler is responsible for heating water to produce steam, while the steam engine converts steam into electricity.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) that extracts iron ore from the ground.\n- Multiple wooden chests (positions 46.5, -83.5; 48.5, -83.5; 5.5, -79.5; 10.5, -79.5) that store coal and other resources.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Cannot place Offshore Pump as it is not in inventory. Ensure the Offshore Pump is present in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- No pipes available. We cannot connect the Boiler to the Steam Engine. Make sure to have pipes in inventory to connect the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
