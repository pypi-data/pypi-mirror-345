{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors Due to Fuel Shortages\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel for burner mining drills and furnaces to avoid warnings such as \"out of fuel\" and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to prevent warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It fails if the item is not available in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n- `copper_mining_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n- `iron_mining_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity, used in the context of inserting items."}
