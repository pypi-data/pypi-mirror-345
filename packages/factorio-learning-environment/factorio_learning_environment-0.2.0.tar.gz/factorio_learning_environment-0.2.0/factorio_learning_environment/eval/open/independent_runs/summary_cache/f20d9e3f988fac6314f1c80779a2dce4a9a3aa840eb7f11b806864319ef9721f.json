In this case, the offshore pump and boiler are too far apart to connect with a pipe.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Make sure that all energy-producing entities (like steam engines) are connected to a power network to avoid \"not connected to power network\" warnings.\n\n### Errors when entities have no input or output\n- Check that all entities requiring input (like boilers) have the necessary connections and fluids available to function properly.\n\n### Errors when picking up pipes\n- Be cautious when picking up pipes that are part of a fluid system. Ensure that you are not disrupting necessary connections."}
