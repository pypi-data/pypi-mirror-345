Dependencies:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all sub-ingredients are available and produced via proper methods before initiating compound crafting operations.\n\n\u2022 Boiler Placement and Rotation Challenges:\n\u2003\u2013 When repositioning or rotating a boiler, verify that its new connection points are correctly aligned with the target\u2019s fluid connection points.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the placement area is free of terrain obstructions and other entities to avoid repeated connection failures.\n\n\u2022 Fluid Connection & Intermediate Pipe Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure both source (boiler) and target (steam engine) connection points are unobstructed and correctly aligned.\n\u2003\u2013 When using intermediate pipe segments, recalculate candidate positions and utilize nearest buildable area methods to ensure clear placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Reposition entities or clear potential blockages along the intended pipe route to allow successful fluid linkage.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Placement Obstruction Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Before placing a pipe, double-check that the target location isn\u2019t already occupied by another object.\n\u2003\u2013 If collisions occur, adjust the placement by selecting alternative nearby buildable positions to avoid blockage.\n\n\u2022 General Placement and Resource Handling:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-calculate material requirements and validate resource availability in advance to prevent cascading errors during assembly and connection tasks."}
