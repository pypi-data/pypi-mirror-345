{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5), offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), and pipes connecting them. The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) and pipes connecting to the steam engine. The offshore pump is operational and is connected to a fluid system that supplies water.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with coal as fuel and producing copper plates.\n- Furnace (position 10.0, 1.0) with iron ore as input but currently out of fuel.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) that is out of fuel and connects to the lab (position 6.5, 1.5) and the furnace (position 10.0, 1.0).\n- Multiple wooden chests (positions 3.5, 1.5), (3.5, 3.5), and (3.5, 5.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the steam engine at position (52.5, 51.5) has available space for coal before attempting to insert. Check if the engine is operational and accepting fuel.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Verify the connection requirements between the offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) and the steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5). Ensure that the necessary pipes are placed correctly and that both entities are positioned to allow for a connection.\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables\n- The error regarding 'builtins' not being defined indicates a potential issue in the script. Ensure that all necessary libraries and modules are properly imported and defined before executing the script.\n\n### Errors when checking power connections\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a power network before checking its power connection status. If the engine is not connected, it will return an error.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The errors regarding the failure to insert coal into the steam engine and the inability to connect pipes have occurred multiple times. Review the setup of these entities to ensure they are configured correctly."}
