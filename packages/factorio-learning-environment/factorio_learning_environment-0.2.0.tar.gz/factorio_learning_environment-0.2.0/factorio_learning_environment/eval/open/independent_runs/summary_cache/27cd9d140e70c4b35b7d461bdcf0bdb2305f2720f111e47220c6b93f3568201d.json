{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around position 41, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Storage system with multiple chests:\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -84.5) storing coal (1600)\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) storing coal (1600)\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal (800)\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around position 46, -80)\nConsists of:\n- Input wooden chest at (45.5, -79.5) containing iron ore\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Burner inserter at (46.5, -79.5) configured to move items from chest to furnaces\n- Output wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing iron plates (1500)\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5) (empty)\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Errors when placing inserters in occupied spaces:\n  - Always check if the target position is clear before attempting to place inserters\n  - Consider using position checking functions to verify space availability\n  - Multiple attempts were made to place inserters at positions (45.5, -80.0), (45.5, -80.25), (45.0, -79.75), (45.0, -79.5) which were already occupied\n\n- Mining system warnings:\n  - Coal mining drill is inactive due to full output chest - implement a system to manage chest contents\n  - Mining drill needs fuel - implement automated refueling system\n\n- Furnace efficiency:\n  - Furnaces lack ingredients despite having fuel - ensure proper item flow from input chest to furnaces\n  - Consider optimizing inserter placement and rotation to ensure smooth material transfer\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  - Failure modes: Attempts to place in occupied spaces\n  - Success modes: Successfully places entities when space is available\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter"}
