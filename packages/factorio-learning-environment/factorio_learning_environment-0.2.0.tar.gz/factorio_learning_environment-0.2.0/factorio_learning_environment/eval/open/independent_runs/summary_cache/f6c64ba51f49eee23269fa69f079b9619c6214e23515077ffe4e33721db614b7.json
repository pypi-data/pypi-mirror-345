{"content": "Here is the updated report:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Primary Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Water source (now working)\n- **Boiler** at (-6.0, -0.5) - Steam production (now fueled with coal)\n- **Steam engine** at (-0.5, -0.5) - Power generation (now connected)\n- Connected pipe network (fluid system 2679) with water flow\n- Separate steam pipe network (fluid system 2681)\n\n### Secondary Power Attempt (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 19.5) - Water source (now connected to boiler)\n- **Boiler** at (-7.5, 20.0) - Steam production (out of fuel)\n- **Steam engine** at (-4.5, 20.5) - Power generation (not connected)\n- Partial fluid connections established\n\n### Circuit Production Setup (Updated)\n- **Assembling machine 2** at (5.5, 0.5) - Now placed but unpowered\n- **Input chest** at (5.5, 1.5)\n- **Output chest** at (5.5, -2.5)\n- Warning: Missing power connection and ingredients\n\n### Remote Production Outpost (Unchanged)\n- **Assembling machine 2** at (50.5, 50.5) - Circuit production (no power)\n- **Wooden chests** at (48.5, 50.5) and (52.5, 50.5) - Empty storage\n- Connected to power pole at (49.5, 48.5)\n\n### Mining Operations (Unchanged)\n- Iron drill at (15.5, 70.5) - Output still blocked\n- Copper drill at (-46.5, 70.5) - Output still blocked\n- Associated furnaces at (16.0, 74.0) and (-46.0, 74.0) - Inactive\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Collisions (Persistent)\n- Multiple failed placements due to existing objects or water\n- Solutions:\n  1. Implement pre-placement terrain checks\n  2. Verify target positions are land tiles\n  3. Clear existing entities before replacement attempts\n\n### Distance Limitations (Recurring)\n- Entity placement attempts beyond 10-tile range\n- Required actions:\n  1. Maintain proximity during builds\n  2. Implement position validation before placement\n  3. Use temporary power poles for remote construction\n\n### Power System Issues (Updated)\n- Secondary power plant partially connected but non-functional\n- Missing medium electric poles for connections\n- Prioritize:\n  1. Complete one functional system before expanding\n  2. Verify all connection points\n  3. Maintain continuous coal supply\n\n### Inventory Management (New)\n- Missing required items for connections (medium electric poles)\n- Implement:\n  1. Pre-build inventory checks\n  2. Automated resource tracking\n  3. Emergency supply runs\n\n### API Usage Errors (New)\n- Incorrect parameter types for placement functions\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Verify argument types before function calls\n  2. Implement type checking\n  3. Review API documentation for required parameters\n\n### Previous Unresolved Issues\n- Mining drill outputs still blocked\n- Remote assembler remains unpowered\n- Secondary power plant incomplete\n- Circuit production not functioning\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `find_clear_land_near_power()` -> Position\n  - Still failing due to undefined dependencies\n  - Needs error handling implementation\n\n### Important Variables\n- `steam_engine`: Primary power generator reference\n- `boiler`: Active steam producer reference\n- `offshore_pump`: Functional water source reference\n- `assembler`: New circuit production reference at (5.5, 0.5)"}
