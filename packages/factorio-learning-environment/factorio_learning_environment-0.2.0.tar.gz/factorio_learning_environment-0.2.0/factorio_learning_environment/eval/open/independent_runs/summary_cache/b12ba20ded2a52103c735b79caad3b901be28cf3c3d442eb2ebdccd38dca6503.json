{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is fueled with coal and is actively mining iron ore. It is connected to two wooden chests and a burner inserter.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): These chests are used for storing mined iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is responsible for transferring iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace. It is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): This furnace is fueled with coal and is actively smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is connected to a burner inserter for input and output.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0): This furnace is also fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nThis section consists of several wooden chests used for storing iron plates:\n\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-49.5), (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-7.5, y=-48.5), (x=-5.5, y=-48.5), (x=-4.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-3.5, y=-48.5): These chests contain various amounts of iron plates.\n\n### Inserter System\nThis system consists of several burner inserters responsible for moving items between chests and furnaces:\n\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), (x=-11.5, y=-46.5), (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-11.5, y=-45.5): These inserters are responsible for moving items between chests and furnaces. Some are waiting for source items, while others are waiting for space in the destination.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting Iron Plates\n- Ensure that the furnace contains iron plates before attempting to extract. Check the furnace's inventory to confirm the presence of iron plates before extraction.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is clear and has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred. Regularly check and clear any blockages at the inserter's drop position to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors When Using Extract Item API\n- Verify the target entity and its inventory before calling the extract_item function. Ensure the entity is correctly referenced and contains the items you intend to extract."}
