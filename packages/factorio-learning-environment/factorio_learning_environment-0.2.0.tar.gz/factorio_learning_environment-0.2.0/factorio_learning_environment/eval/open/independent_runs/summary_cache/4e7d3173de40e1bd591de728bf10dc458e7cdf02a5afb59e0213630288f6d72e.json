{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) - Status: NO_FUEL\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Pipe-group at position (-5.5, 16.5) - Status: EMPTY\n- Pipe-group at position (-8.5, 23.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT\n- Electricity-group at position (-5.4, 20.0) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) and the boiler at (-2.5, 24.0). Verify that there are no obstacles and that the correct type of pipe is used.\n\n### Errors when connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Check the alignment and connection of pipes between the boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) and the steam engine at (-5.5, 19.5). Ensure the correct type of pipe is used and that there are no blockages.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that the boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) is supplied with fuel, such as coal, to function properly.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients\n- The stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) requires ingredients to operate. Ensure that the necessary materials are available and inserted.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network Connection\n- The electricity group at (-5.4, 20.0) is not plugged into the electric network. Ensure that small electric poles are placed correctly and connected to the network to provide power.\n\n### Errors due to Inventory Shortages\n- Ensure that the inventory has the required items before attempting to place entities. For example, ensure small electric poles are available in the inventory before placement attempts."}
