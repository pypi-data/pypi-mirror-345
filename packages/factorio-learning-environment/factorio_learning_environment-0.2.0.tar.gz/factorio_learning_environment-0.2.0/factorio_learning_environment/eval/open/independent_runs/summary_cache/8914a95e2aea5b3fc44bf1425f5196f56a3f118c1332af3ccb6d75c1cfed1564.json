{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position (-2.5, 10.5)\n- Pipe groups connecting water from pump to boiler and steam from boiler to engine\n- Small electric pole at position (-0.5, 11.5) connected to the steam engine\n\n### Coal Mining System 1\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 0.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 1.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 2.5) moving coal from chest to transport belt\n- Transport belt system connecting to the boiler\n\n### Coal Mining System 2\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (18.0, 21.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 22.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 23.5) moving coal from chest to transport belt\n- Transport belt system connecting to the iron furnace area\n\n### Iron Production System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (15.5, 70.5) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 74.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 72.5) moving iron ore from drill to furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (14.5, 74.5) for inserting coal into the furnace\n- Small electric pole at position (16.5, 68.5) providing power to the mining drill\n- Transport belt system bringing coal from Coal Mining System 2\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity placement spacing and direction\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and direction to avoid collisions\n- Consider the size of entities (e.g., steam engines are 3x5 tiles) when planning placement\n- Use appropriate spacing parameter when using place_entity_next_to function\n\n### Errors with pipe connections\n- Ensure proper alignment of fluid-carrying entities (boilers, steam engines, pipes)\n- Connect entities in a direct path without obstacles\n- Make sure the output of one fluid entity can reach the input of the next\n\n### Errors with transport belt connections\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly from chests - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are not already occupied by other entities\n- Check that the drop position of an inserter is clear before attempting to place belts there\n\n### Errors with mining drill output\n- Mining drill drop positions must be clear or have a valid receiving entity\n- Cannot place inserters where they would overlap with the mining drill's working area\n- Ensure proper alignment between mining drills and inserters\n\n### Errors with entity connections\n- When connecting entities with belts or pipes, ensure there is a valid path between them\n- Check that connection points are not blocked by other entities\n- Make sure target entities can receive the intended resources from source entities\n\nAI: # FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position (-2.5, 10.5)\n- Pipe groups connecting water from pump to boiler and steam from boiler to engine\n- Small electric pole at position (-0.5, 11.5) connected to the steam engine\n\n### Coal Mining System 1\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 0.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 1.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 2.5) moving coal from chest to transport belt\n- Transport belt system connecting to the boiler\n\n### Coal Mining System 2\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (18.0, 21.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 22.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at position"}
