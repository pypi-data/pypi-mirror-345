The stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is working and has 4 iron ore to smelt.\n2. The other furnaces are still out of fuel or ingredients.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. The furnace is currently processing the iron ore into iron plates. \n2. Once the smelting is complete, we will have more iron plates available.\n3. We can then use these iron plates along with the iron gear wheel to craft the Assembling Machine 1.\n\nLet\u2019s monitor the furnace until it completes the smelting process. After that, we can check the inventory and proceed with crafting the Assembling Machine 1.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for the furnace to complete smelting (with a safety timeout)\nfor _ in range(30):  # Maximum 30 seconds wait\n    if inspect_inventory(new_furnace)[Prototype.IronPlate] >= 7:  # Check if we have enough iron plates\n        break\n    sleep(1)\nelse:\n    raise Exception(\"Smelting timeout - check fuel and inputs\")\n\n# Check the updated inventory after smelting\nprint(f\"Inventory after smelting: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Updated Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check the updated status of the entities after smelting", "summary_range": "[1-176]"}
