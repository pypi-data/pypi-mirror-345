{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) refueled with coal to maintain operations of the iron ore processing facility.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5) refueled with coal, intended to transfer items from the furnace, currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with both their pickup and drop positions. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items between entities.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the inserter's status and reposition if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Inventory Resources\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required resources are available in your inventory. This avoids errors related to missing items during operations."}
