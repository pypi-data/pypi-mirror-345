{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5) connected to the stone furnace and a wooden chest at position (61.5, -52.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) containing stone-brick, wood, coal, and stone.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a warning of being out of fuel and full chest blockage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple interconnected belt groups:\n- BeltGroup 1: Inputs at (45.5, -82.5) to outputs at (48.5, -79.5) with 7 belts.\n- BeltGroup 2: Inputs at (43.5, -80.5) to outputs at (63.5, -50.5) with 51 belts.\n- BeltGroup 3: Inputs at (42.5, -81.5) to outputs at (65.5, -46.5) with 67 belts.\n- BeltGroup 4: Inputs at (44.5, -81.5) to outputs at (65.5, -54.5) with 49 belts.\n- BeltGroup 5: Inputs at (49.5, -80.5) to outputs at (60.5, -69.5) with 23 belts.\n- BeltGroup 6: Inputs at (49.5, -78.5) to outputs at (58.5, -69.5) with 19 belts.\n- BeltGroup 7: Inputs at (50.5, -79.5) to outputs at (59.5, -70.5) with 19 belts.\n- BeltGroup 8: Inputs at (59.5, -68.5) to outputs at (67.5, -54.5) with 23 belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure sufficient space in the inventory before attempting to store items. Consider crafting additional chests or clearing existing inventory to avoid full inventory errors.\n\n### Resource Gathering and Usage Errors\n- Before attempting to harvest resources, ensure there is available space in the inventory to store the harvested items.\n- Ensure that the required resources are available in the inventory before attempting to supply furnaces or other entities.\n\n### Crafting and Technology Errors\n- Research necessary technologies before attempting to craft items that require unlocked recipes, such as assembling machines.\n- Gather raw resources like wood before attempting to craft items that require them as ingredients.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Ensure that there are available items in the inventory before attempting to place new entities like chests.\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place an entity.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory with item names as keys and their counts as values. Current state: {'transport-belt': 200, 'burner-inserter': 101, 'stone-furnace': 1, 'coal': 3000, 'iron-plate': 200, 'iron-gear-wheel': 1105}.\n\n### Research and Crafting\n- Automation research has been initiated, requiring 10 automation-science-packs."}
