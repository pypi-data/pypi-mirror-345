{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-11.5, -3.5) - Now missing (removed in step 76)\n- **Boiler** at (-8.5, 0.0) - Operational with coal fuel but disconnected (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Pipe Network** (system 15581):\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n\n### New Power Plant (Updated)\n- **Boiler** at (35.5, 47.0) - Fueled with coal but no water input\n- **Steam Engine** at (46.5, 40.5) - Newly placed but not connected (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Pipe Network**:\n  - Pipes connecting boiler to steam engine (system 14475)\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Updated)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Unpowered (status: NO_POWER)\n- **Oil Refinery** at (24.5, 44.5) - Unpowered (status: NO_POWER)\n- **Chemical Plant** at (40.5, 40.5) - Removed (missing in step 79)\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Unchanged)\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at (34.5, 20.5) - Unpowered\n- **Transport Belt System** moving coal (status: WORKING)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Issues (Updated)\n- Boiler connection failures - Verify all connection points are unobstructed before testing\n- Steam engine placement distance - Move within 10 tiles before placement attempts\n- Power pole placement conflicts - Clear target positions completely before placement\n\n### Construction Problems (Updated)\n- Entity placement distance errors (steps 75,77,78) - Always verify player proximity before placement\n- Entity collision errors (steps 77,78) - Implement complete clearance checks\n- Missing entity lookups (steps 76,79) - Verify entity existence before interaction\n\n### Fluid System Issues (Updated)\n- Pipe connection validation - Ensure all connection points are accessible\n- Steam engine input validation - Confirm fluid paths before testing operation\n- Offshore pump positioning - Verify water access before placement\n\n### System Validation (Updated)\n1. Always verify inventory before placement operations\n2. Implement complete clearance checks for all constructions\n3. Validate power connections before asserting operational status\n4. Check fluid system integrity after construction\n5. Confirm entity positions before interaction attempts\n6. Validate distance requirements before placement operations\n7. Verify entity existence before lookup operations\n8. Clear target positions completely before placement attempts"}
