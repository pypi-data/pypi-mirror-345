{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure the tile is buildable before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for any obstacles or terrain restrictions that might prevent placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Verify that the target position is not already occupied by another entity or is within a restricted area before placing an entity.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources available for the intended operation, such as coal for furnaces, before attempting to place or use entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without checking global build restrictions\n- Check for any global build restrictions that might prevent entity placement in certain areas. This includes understanding the map's buildable zones and any specific rules that might apply.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without proper initialization\n- Confirm that the environment is correctly initialized and that all necessary preconditions are met before attempting to place entities."}
