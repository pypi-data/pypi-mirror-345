{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) moving items between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) feeding Furnace 2.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) for storage.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) awaiting source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like inserters and mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors due to inventory mismanagement\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert or extract items. For example, attempting to insert coal when none is available will result in an error.\n\n### UnboundLocalError due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are properly defined and initialized before use to avoid UnboundLocalError.\n\n### ValueError due to incorrect argument types\n- When using functions, ensure that the arguments are of the correct type. For example, when passing an entity or position object, ensure it is not an integer or another incorrect type."}
