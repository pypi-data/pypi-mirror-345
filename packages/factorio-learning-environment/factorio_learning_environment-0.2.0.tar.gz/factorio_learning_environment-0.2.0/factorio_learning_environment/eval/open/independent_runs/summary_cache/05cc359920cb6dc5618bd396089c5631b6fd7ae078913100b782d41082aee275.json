{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) for storing coal and other resources.\n\n### Coal Extraction and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) for transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for additional storage.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Related to Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the output of the furnace is regularly emptied to prevent production halts. The furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) frequently reaches full output, which stops further production. Regularly extract iron plates to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- The burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) is waiting for source items. Ensure that the source (e.g., mining drill or chest) has items to transfer, or adjust the inserter's position and direction to align with the source and destination.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like wood, coal, and iron plates.\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the furnace, including iron ore and iron plates.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - A list of entities currently on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
