Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup  \n   Purpose: Facilitates the extraction and routing of iron ore.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 A burner\u2010mining drill at position (\u201315.0, \u201350.0)  \n   \u2022 An adjacent wooden chest at (\u201313.5, \u201351.5)  \n   \u2022 Transport belts in the vicinity (e.g. near (\u201314.5, \u201348.5) and (\u201315.5, \u201348.5)) that integrate the mining output\n\n3. Steam Power Generation System  \n   Purpose: Supplies power by converting water and fuel into steam energy.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 A boiler at (8.0, 20.5) with connection points at (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5)  \n   \u2022 Multiple steam engines placed at (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5) and (4.5, 23.5)  \n   \u2022 An extra steam engine that remains unplaced due to spatial congestion; overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts in the boiler zone prevent a clear buildable area\n\n4. Automation Research Lab  \n   Purpose: Conducts research on automation science packs.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 Lab units (with reported electrical IDs) that are in place but continue to show NO_POWER connectivity issues\n\n5. Electrical, Transport, and Fluid Infrastructure  \n   Purpose: Provides an integrated backbone for power distribution, material transport and fluid handling.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 ElectricityGroups consolidating power poles at varied coordinates  \n   \u2022 Interlinked BeltGroups and PipeGroups that connect production and processing entities\n\n6. Offshore Pump and Fluid Network  \n   Purpose: Ensures a reliable water supply for fluid-dependent processes.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 An offshore pump positioned at (0.5, 30.5)  \n   \u2022 Multiple PipeGroups conveying water throughout the network\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  - The extra steam engine persistently fails to be placed due to extreme spatial congestion in the boiler area.  \n  - Overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts around the boiler at (8.0, 20.5) \u2013 with obstructed clearance even near (8.5, 22.5) \u2013 prevent the creation of a proper buildable space.  \n  - To resolve, manually reassess and clear the entire boiler zone and adjoining connection interfaces by removing or repositioning interfering entities; alternatively, consider relocating the extra steam engine or modifying the boiler layout to secure sufficient clearance.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Supply and Connectivity Issues  \n  - Burner\u2011inserters and the burner\u2011mining drill repeatedly report \u201cout of fuel\u201d or \u201cwaiting for source items.\u201d  \n  - Ensure that fuel sources are positioned immediately adjacent to these machines and that transport belt routing is unobstructed.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine and Fluid Connection Deficiencies  \n  - Multiple steam engines indicate warnings of not being connected to the power network and lack proper fluid input.  \n  - Review and reconfigure both electrical wiring and fluid pipeline connections to guarantee adequate supply.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Instability  \n  - The Automation Research Lab continues to show NO_POWER errors.  \n  - Inspect and adjust the surrounding electrical infrastructure (pole placements and wiring) to restore stable power.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n(No custom functions defined.)"}
