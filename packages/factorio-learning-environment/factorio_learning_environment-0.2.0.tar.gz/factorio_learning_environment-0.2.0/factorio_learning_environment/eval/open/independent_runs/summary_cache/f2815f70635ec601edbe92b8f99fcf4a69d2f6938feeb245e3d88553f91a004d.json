{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space for the entity's BuildingBox before attempting to place it. Consider using smaller BuildingBoxes or multiple smaller ones if space is constrained.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that the required resources, such as wooden chests, are available in the inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and furnaces to ensure continuous operation and avoid \"out of fuel\" warnings.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory\n- Verify the entity's status and ensure it is operational before attempting to inspect its inventory to avoid stale data errors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Attempts to place an entity at a specified position. Ensure the entity is available in the inventory and the position is viable before calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `building_box`: Type: BuildingBox, initialized with width=0.5 and height=0.5. Ensure correct type conversion to avoid errors.\n- `copper_ore_quantity`: Type: int, initialized from inspecting the inventory of a copper drill. Ensure the drill is operational before inspection."}
