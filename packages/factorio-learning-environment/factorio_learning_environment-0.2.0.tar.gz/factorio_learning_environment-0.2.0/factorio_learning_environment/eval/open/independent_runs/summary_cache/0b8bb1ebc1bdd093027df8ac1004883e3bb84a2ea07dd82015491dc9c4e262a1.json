Ensure precise alignment of all pipe segments for efficient stabilization.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Integration Issues:\n  - The steam engine remains NOT_CONNECTED with persistent warnings (no connection to power network, no input liquid, no fluid present in connections).\n  - Tip: After confirming the correct water supply from a validated PipeGroup, double-check the integration between the steam engine, the pipeline network, and the active electricity network to resolve connectivity mismatches."}
