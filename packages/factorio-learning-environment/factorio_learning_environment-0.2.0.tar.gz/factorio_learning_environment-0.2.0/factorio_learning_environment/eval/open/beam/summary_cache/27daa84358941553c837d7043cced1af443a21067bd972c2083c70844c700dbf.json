The current inventory status is as follows:\n- **Stone**: 15 units\n- **Iron Plates**: 9 units\n- **Copper Cables**: 18 units\n- **Iron Gear Wheels**: 8 units\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Furnace Status**: The furnace was successfully emptied, and it no longer contains any iron ore or plates.\n2. **Crafting Limitations**: Despite having **9 iron plates**, I still do not have enough to craft the required **10 iron gear wheels**.\n3. **Next Steps**: I need to gather more iron ore to smelt additional iron plates to reach the crafting goal.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Locate and gather more iron ore** to smelt into additional iron plates.\n2. **Continue monitoring the inventory** to ensure I reach the target of 10 iron plates for crafting.\n3. **Plan for future crafting** based on the resources gathered.\n\nLet's proceed to locate a nearby iron ore patch and gather more resources to continue production.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Locate the nearest iron ore patch to gather more resources\niron_patch_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\n# Move to the iron ore patch position to start mining\nmove_to(iron_patch_position)\n# Harvest 10 units of iron ore from the nearest resource patch\nharvest_resource(iron_patch_position, quantity=10)\nprint(f\"Inventory changed to {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check the inventory after gathering more iron ore", "summary_range": "[1-152]"}
