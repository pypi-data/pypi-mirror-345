The inventory is currently full, which prevents the insertion of coal.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from the furnace\n- Verify that the furnace contains the items you are trying to extract. The error indicates that the furnace does not have any iron plates available for extraction.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
