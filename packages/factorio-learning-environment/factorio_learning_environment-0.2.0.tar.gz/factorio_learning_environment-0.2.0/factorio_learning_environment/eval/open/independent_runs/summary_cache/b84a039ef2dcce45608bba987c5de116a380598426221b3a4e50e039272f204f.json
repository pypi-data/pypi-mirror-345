{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) and position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for moving coal from the mining drill to chests.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=42.5, y=-83.5), and (x=41.5, y=-79.5) for storing coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting the chests at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5) for transporting coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace 1 at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and Furnace 2 at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Both furnaces are supplied with iron ore and coal manually.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserters to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity to confirm availability.\n\n### Errors due to Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Make sure to supply the furnaces with the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to maintain continuous production. Regularly check the furnace inventory and replenish as needed.\n\n### Errors due to Mining Drill Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the burner mining drill to prevent it from stopping. Monitor fuel levels and replenish before they are exhausted.\n\n### Errors when Using Stale Entity Data\n- Ensure that the entity data is up-to-date before performing operations. Refresh or re-query the entity data to avoid using stale information."}
