{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for storing coal\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for moving items\n- Belt system for transporting coal\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing coal and iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles connecting the lab at (x=5.5, y=5.5) to the power source at (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Verify that there are no missing or misaligned pipe sections.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items with Zero Quantity\n- Always specify a positive quantity when extracting items from a chest. Ensure the quantity is greater than zero to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
