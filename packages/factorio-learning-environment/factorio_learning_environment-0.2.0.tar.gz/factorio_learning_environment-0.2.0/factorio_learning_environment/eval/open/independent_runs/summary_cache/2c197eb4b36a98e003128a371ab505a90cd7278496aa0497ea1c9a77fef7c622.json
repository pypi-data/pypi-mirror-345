Attempts using fluid_system identifiers [84606, 84690, 84772, 84856, 84938, 85022, 85104, 85188, 85270, 85354, 85436, 85520, 85602, 85686, 85768, 85852] near position (-5.5, 19.5) consistently returned zero candidates. Ensure that pipe groups with the correct fluid system identifiers are installed within the required radius before attempting connection."}
