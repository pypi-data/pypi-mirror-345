There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended entity before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities or terrain that might obstruct placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the destination location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity there.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources in inventory\n- Ensure that the required resources are available in your inventory before attempting to insert or use them in any operation.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or a clear path for outputs from production entities like drills or furnaces to prevent blockage warnings and maintain efficient production flow."}
