{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) which is currently working and extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) which is successfully producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to lack of inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, the error \"Could not place burner-mining-drill at (-21.0, -52.0), No burner_mining_drill in inventory\" indicates a lack of the required item.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Verify that the target location is free and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. Errors like \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the desired location\" and \"Cannot place Transport Belt at the desired location\" suggest that the chosen tile is occupied or unsuitable.\n\n### Errors related to furnace production\n- Ensure the furnace setup is correct and has the necessary inputs and fuel. Multiple errors such as \"The furnace is not producing iron plates. Check the setup\" indicate issues with the furnace configuration or supply chain.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
