{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (61.0, -52.0) and (63.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -52.0) and furnace at position (63.0, -52.0)\n- Both furnaces are currently operational, smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace has enough space to accept the items before attempting to insert them.\n- Verify that the furnace has the required ingredients to operate; if it shows \"no ingredients to smelt,\" it indicates a lack of necessary materials.\n\n### Errors when harvesting resources\n- Make sure to approach the resource node directly before attempting to harvest to avoid any distance-related issues.\n\n### Repeated actions\n- Avoid repetitive actions without checking the status of the entities involved, as this can lead to unnecessary errors or inefficiencies."}
