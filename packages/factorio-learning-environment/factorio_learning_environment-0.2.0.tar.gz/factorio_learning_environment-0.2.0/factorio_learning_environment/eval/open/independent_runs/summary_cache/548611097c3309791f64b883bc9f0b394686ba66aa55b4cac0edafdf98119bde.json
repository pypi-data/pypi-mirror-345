{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and status indicating it is working. The drill is currently output blocked due to no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace has no ingredients to smelt and is currently not producing due to lack of input materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving or placing entities\n- Ensure the target location is unoccupied and suitable for the entity before attempting to move or place it. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot move Stone Furnace to the desired location\" and \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will avoid errors like \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.5 y=-52.5.\"\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or storage to accept the output from production entities like drills. This will prevent the \"output blocked by item on the ground\" warning.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Regularly check and supply necessary ingredients to production entities like furnaces to ensure continuous operation and avoid \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings."}
