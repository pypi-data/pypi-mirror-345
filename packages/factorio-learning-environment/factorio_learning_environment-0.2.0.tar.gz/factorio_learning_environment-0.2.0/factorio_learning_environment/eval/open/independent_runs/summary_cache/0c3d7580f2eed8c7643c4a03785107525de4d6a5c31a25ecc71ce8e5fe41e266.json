{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -48.5) intended to transfer items to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storage purposes.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -46.5) intended to transfer items from a wooden chest at position (-13.5, -45.5).\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (52.5, -79.5) intended to transfer items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (52.5, -77.5) for storage purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) is supplied with the necessary ingredients to operate. The furnace is currently showing a status of `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`.\n\n### Errors Due to Output Blockage\n- The Burner Mining Drills at positions (52.0, -82.0) and (-12.0, -51.0) are experiencing output blockage. Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output or clear any items on the ground blocking the output.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- The Burner Inserters at positions (52.5, -79.5) and (-11.5, -48.5) are waiting for source items. Verify that the source entities are operational and supplying items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int, current count is 75.\n  - `iron-plate`: int, current count is 212. \n\nThis report provides a concise overview of the existing structures and errors encountered, along with suggestions for improvements."}
