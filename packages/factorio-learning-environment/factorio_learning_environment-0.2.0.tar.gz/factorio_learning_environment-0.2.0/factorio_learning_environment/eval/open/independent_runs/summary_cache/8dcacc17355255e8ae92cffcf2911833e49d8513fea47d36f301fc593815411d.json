{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0), which is currently operational but has a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, y=-60.5), (4.5, y=-58.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5), and (8.5, y=-60.5). The chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0). The furnace at (-15.0, y=-48.0) is full of iron plates, while the others have warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt and full fuel sources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure to regularly extract items from the furnace output slots to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chest at Drop Position\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure to supply the necessary ingredients to the furnaces to maintain continuous smelting operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **Inventory**: {'wooden-chest': 3, 'coal': 10, 'iron-plate': 6144, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}\n- **Burner Mining Drill Fuel**: Inventory({'coal': 2})\n- **Furnace Fuel and Source**: \n  - Furnace at (-15.0, y=-48.0): Fuel - Inventory({'coal': 35}), Source - Inventory({'iron-ore': 6})\n  - Furnace at (-13.0, y=-48.0): Fuel - Inventory({'coal': 48}), Source - Inventory({})\n  - Furnace at (-11.0, y=-48.0): Fuel - Inventory({'coal': 50}), Source - Inventory({})"}
