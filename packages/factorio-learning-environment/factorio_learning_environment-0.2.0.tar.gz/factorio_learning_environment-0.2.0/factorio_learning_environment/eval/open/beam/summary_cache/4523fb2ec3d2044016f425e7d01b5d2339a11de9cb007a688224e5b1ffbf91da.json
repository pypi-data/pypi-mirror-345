{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has not gone as expected:\n\n### New Active Furnace Status:\n- The furnace now contains **3 pieces of stone**, but it is still not processing any materials.\n- The status of the furnace is **\"WORKING\"**, indicating it is operational but still requires additional materials to engage in smelting.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the new one)\n  - 9 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n  - **1 piece of stone** remaining in total inventory after the last operation.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace requires a total of **5 pieces of stone** to smelt Copper Ore, but it currently has only **3 pieces**.\n- The furnace is not processing because it lacks sufficient stone and possibly the Copper Ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Reinsert the Copper Ore**: I will insert the **1 piece of Copper Ore** into the furnace to ensure it has the necessary input for smelting.\n2. **Load Additional Stone**: I need to gather **2 more pieces of stone** to meet the requirement.\n3. **Check Processing Activation**: After loading the necessary materials, I will confirm if the furnace begins the smelting process.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by inserting the Copper Ore into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load 1 piece of Copper Ore into the active furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, new_active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Insert the Copper Ore into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading Copper Ore\nnew_active_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Inspect status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_copper_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting Copper Ore.\n\nprint(f\"New Active Furnace inventory status after loading Copper Ore: {new_active_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading Copper Ore.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading Copper Ore: {overall_inventory_after_copper_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations. \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-396]"}
