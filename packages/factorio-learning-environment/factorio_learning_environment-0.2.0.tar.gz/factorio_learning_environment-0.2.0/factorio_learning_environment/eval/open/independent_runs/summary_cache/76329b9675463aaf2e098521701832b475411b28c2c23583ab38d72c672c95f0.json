{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for transferring items, currently not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Electricity Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), working and connected to a water source.\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0), not connected to the fluid system.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5), not connected to the power network.\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not researching.\n\n### Electrical Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple small electric poles forming an electricity group with ID 25299, currently with zero voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid System Connection Errors\n- Ensure that the offshore pump and boiler are connected to the same fluid system. Verify the alignment and connection of pipes to ensure they are correctly linking the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Pipe Connection Errors\n- Before attempting to rebuild pipe connections, ensure that the path is clear and that pipes are placed correctly to connect all necessary components without gaps or misalignments.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply Issues\n- Check that inserters are connected to a power source. Ensure that the electrical network is functioning and that there are no breaks in the power line to the inserter.\n\n### General Placement and Connection Tips\n- Verify that all entities are placed in their intended positions and that connections between entities (such as pipes, belts, and power lines) are complete and functional."}
