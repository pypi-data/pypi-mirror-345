{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-15.5 to x=-4.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-15.5, y=-3.5) - connected to pipe network 11631 (water)\n- Boiler (x=-12.0, y=-4.5) - contains 2 coal, connected to pipe network 11631\n- Steam engine (x=-8.5, y=-4.5) - operational, connected to power network\n- Pipe-to-ground connection (x=-6.5, y=-1.5) - disconnected\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=40.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - operational, connected to crude oil pipe network 11647\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - has power but experiencing fluid ingredient shortage (crude oil)\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - operational but empty\n- Chemical plant (x=40.5, y=40.5) - has power but missing coal for plastic production\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - powered but waiting for source items\n- Wooden chest (x=37.5, y=37.5) - empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid connection issues\n- Failed to connect pumpjack to refinery (steps 120-127)\n  - Verify correct prototype name (PumpJack not Pumpjack)\n  - Ensure proper alignment between connection points\n  - Check for obstructions in pipe path\n\n### Oil processing problems\n- Refinery status shows fluid ingredient shortage (steps 125-127)\n  - Confirm crude oil is reaching refinery input connection\n  - Verify pipe network fluid type matches refinery input\n  - Check refinery recipe configuration (basic oil processing)\n\n### Chemical plant issues\n- Missing coal for plastic production (steps 121-127)\n  - Maintain coal supply chain to chemical plant\n  - Verify inserter setup for coal delivery\n  - Check chest inventory for coal storage\n\n### Persistent problems from previous steps:\n1. Complete all fluid connections with proper alignment\n2. Verify entity prototype names are correct (case-sensitive)\n3. Maintain adequate inventory of critical components\n4. Check recipe configurations match available inputs\n5. Validate power connections for all production buildings\n\n### Recommended immediate actions:\n1. Fix crude oil pipeline connection between pumpjack and refinery\n2. Supply coal to chemical plant at x=40.5 y=40.5\n3. Verify refinery input/output connections\n4. Check storage tank connections for petroleum gas output"}
