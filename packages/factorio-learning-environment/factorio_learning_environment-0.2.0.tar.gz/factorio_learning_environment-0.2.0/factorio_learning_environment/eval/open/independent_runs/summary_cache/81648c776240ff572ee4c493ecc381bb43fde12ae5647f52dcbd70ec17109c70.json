{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, -58.5), (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests that are full to prevent halting of mining operations. For instance, the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to continue smelting. The furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) has no ingredients to smelt, which halts production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int\n- `iron_plate`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `iron_gear_wheel`: int\n\nThis report summarizes the current state of the agent's structures and provides guidance on addressing operational errors."}
