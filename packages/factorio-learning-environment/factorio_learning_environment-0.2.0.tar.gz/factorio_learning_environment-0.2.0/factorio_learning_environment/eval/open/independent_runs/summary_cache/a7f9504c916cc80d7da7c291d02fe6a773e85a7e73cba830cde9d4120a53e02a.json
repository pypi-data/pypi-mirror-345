{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts have failed due to various errors, as detailed in the error tips section below.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in unbuildable positions\n- Ensure that the position where you want to place an entity is buildable. The logs indicate multiple attempts to place Stone Furnaces and Wooden Chests at positions that are not buildable. Verify the terrain and ensure it's suitable for construction before placing entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check if the tile is already occupied by another entity or is otherwise restricted. Several attempts to place Wooden Chests and Transport Belts failed because the target positions were not suitable.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that the necessary resources are available before attempting to supply entities like Furnaces. Logs indicate attempts to supply coal to Furnaces that were either not placed or had no coal available.\n\n### General tips for successful placement\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the placement logic accounts for environmental and positional constraints.\n- Consider conducting a preliminary check of the environment to identify clear areas for building, as indicated by the log entry identifying a potential clear area for a small entity."}
