{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (17.5, 20.5), currently working with an energy level of 15000.0.\n- **Boiler** at position (1.5, 23.0), fueled with coal and working, with a steam output at position (1.5, 21.5).\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5), supplying water to the system.\n- **Pipe Group** for steam, connecting various positions from (3.5, 17.5) to (10.5, 21.5).\n- **Pipe Group** for water, connecting various positions from (-9.5, 23.5) to (-0.5, 23.5).\n- **Electricity Group** with poles distributed across multiple positions, ensuring power distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the connection between pipes and entities like the steam engine is feasible. Check that the positions are correctly aligned and within reach.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities without Inventory\n- Verify that the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map."}
