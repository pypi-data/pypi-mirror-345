{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (43.0, -82.0) used for smelting operations.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, if you want to insert iron ore into a furnace, make sure there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
