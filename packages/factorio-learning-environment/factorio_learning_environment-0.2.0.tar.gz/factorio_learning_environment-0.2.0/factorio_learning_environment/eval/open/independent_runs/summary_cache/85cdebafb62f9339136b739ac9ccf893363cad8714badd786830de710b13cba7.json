{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and processing iron ore to produce iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n  - Transfers iron plates from the Stone Furnace to the Wooden Chest.\n  - Fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-13.5, -46.5)\n  - Stores the iron plates produced by the Stone Furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues\n- Ensure that the placement location is valid and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features.\n- Verify that there are no global restrictions or settings preventing placement in certain areas.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Iron plates cannot be crafted directly; they must be smelted in a furnace. Ensure that the necessary structures are in place for smelting operations.\n\n### Validation Errors for BuildingBox\n- Ensure that the dimensions for entities are provided as valid integers when performing operations that require size specifications."}
