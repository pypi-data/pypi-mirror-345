{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at Position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (52.0, -79.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (53.5, -79.5) that transfers items from the furnace to a chest\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (54.5, -79.5) storing iron plates\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from the mining drill to the chest\n\n#### Storage Area at Position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), (2.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), (4.5, 0.5), and (5.5, 0.5) storing various items like coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without fuel\n- Ensure that entities like **Burner Mining Drills** and **Burner Inserters** have sufficient fuel before placing them. For example, the **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) is out of fuel and cannot operate.\n\n#### Errors when chests are full\n- Ensure that chests are not full before attempting to transfer items into them. For example, the **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) cannot drop items because the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full.\n\n#### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that inserters have a valid source of items to transfer. For example, the **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5) is waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. For example, the **Stone Furnace** at position (52.0, -79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- None assigned yet."}
