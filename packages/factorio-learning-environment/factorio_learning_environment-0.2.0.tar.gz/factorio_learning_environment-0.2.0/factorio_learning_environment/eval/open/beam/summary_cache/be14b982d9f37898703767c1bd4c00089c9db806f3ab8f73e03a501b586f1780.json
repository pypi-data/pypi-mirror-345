{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe extraction of Copper Ore from the active furnace has been successful, leading to the following updated statuses:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now contains **18 Iron Plates** and does not hold any Copper Ore or stone, indicating that the extraction was successful.\n- The furnace is currently in a **\"WORKING\"** state but is not processing any materials since it has no inputs.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 6 pieces of stone\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** remaining (after extraction)\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is now clear of Copper Ore, allowing me to proceed with the next steps.\n- I still need to load **2 pieces of stone** into the furnace to fulfill the recipe requirements for smelting.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Insert Stone into the Furnace**: Load **2 pieces of stone** into the active furnace to enable the smelting recipe.\n2. **Reinsert Copper Ore for Processing**: After loading the stone, I can then reinsert the remaining **1 piece of Copper Ore** to ensure it gets smelted into Copper Plates.\n3. **Verify Smelting Operation**: After adjustments, check to ensure the furnace begins smelting Copper Ore into Copper Plates.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to load the required stone into the active furnace to enable smelting operations. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the required stone into the active furnace to enable smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Insert 2 pieces of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_stone_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading stone: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading stone: {overall_inventory_after_stone_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-312]"}
