{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace 1 at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) supplying coal.\n- Furnace 2 at position (-12.0, -48.0) with a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) supplying coal.\n- Transport belts connecting furnaces to an iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5).\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (-3.5, 23.5).\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5).\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5).\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Belt group connecting various entities, including a section from position (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5) and another from (-8.5, -45.5) to (-8.5, -43.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter at position (-11.5, -45.5) has a clear path to deposit items into the iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5). Check for any obstructions on the transport belt network that might be causing blockages.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Before attempting to insert items into furnaces or other entities, verify that the required items are present in the inventory to avoid errors such as \"No iron-ore to insert\" or \"No coal to insert.\"\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- When extracting items from entities like furnaces, ensure that the entity contains the items you intend to extract to avoid errors like \"Could not extract iron-plate from stone-furnace.\"\n\n### Inserter Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel burner inserters to ensure they have enough fuel to operate efficiently and avoid waiting for source items due to lack of fuel."}
