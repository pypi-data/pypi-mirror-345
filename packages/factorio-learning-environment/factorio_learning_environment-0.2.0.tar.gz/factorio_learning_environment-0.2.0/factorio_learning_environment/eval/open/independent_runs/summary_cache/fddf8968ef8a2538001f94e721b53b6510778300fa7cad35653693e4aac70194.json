{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), which is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it is currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues with the inserter.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5), which is intended to transfer coal to the stone furnace. It is currently waiting for source items, indicating a potential issue with coal supply or positioning.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Frequent repositioning indicates that the initial setup was incorrect. Regularly verify the alignment to prevent interruptions in material flow.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure that it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment or lack of fuel in the inserter can cause this issue.\n\n### Coal Refueling Issues\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel inserters and mining drills. Lack of coal can halt operations, as seen with the inserter waiting for source items.\n\n### General Placement and Refueling\n- Regularly refuel all burner entities with coal to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and refill as necessary to prevent downtime."}
