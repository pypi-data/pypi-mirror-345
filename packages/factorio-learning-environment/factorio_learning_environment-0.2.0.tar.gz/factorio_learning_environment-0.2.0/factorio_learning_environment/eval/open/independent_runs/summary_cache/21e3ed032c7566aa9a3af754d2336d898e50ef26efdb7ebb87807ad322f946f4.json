{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts were made to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for Automation Science Pack research; however, placement and crafting failed due to missing inventory and resource shortages. No other structural assemblies were created during these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage \u2013 When calling get_entities, ensure that the provided arguments match the API\u2019s requirements. Avoid using unexpected keywords (e.g., \"radius\") and confirm whether the call should be made with positional arguments only.\n\u2022 Retrieval and Iteration Handling \u2013 Before iterating over the result of get_entities, validate that it is not None (or substitute an empty list) to prevent TypeError issues.\n\u2022 Placement Prerequisites \u2013 Verify that the desired structure (e.g. Lab) is available in your inventory before attempting placement at a designated position.\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Management \u2013 Confirm that all sub-ingredients required for lab crafting (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are producible or sufficiently stocked. This also includes ensuring that prerequisite processes (like smelting for iron-plates and copper-plates) have been executed to yield enough resources for subsequent recipes.\n\n"}
