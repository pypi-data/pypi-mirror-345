{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0), fueled with coal and working, but frequently full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), fueled and operational, feeding chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Persistent output blockage at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and storage of iron plates with improved inserter fueling and power connectivity, though output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5), recently refueled but currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5), working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles at (-4.5, -0.5), (0.5, 3.5), (15.5, 75.5), (0.5, 6.5), and (25.5, 80.5) forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power but requires consistent boiler fueling to maintain operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates to assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) with output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Despite repeated insertion of iron plates into input chest and assembler, assembling machine input and output inventories remain empty, indicating assembly is not occurring.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production, with power and inserter setup complete, but assembly is not functioning due to ingredient or recipe issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt drop position\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" preventing output flow.\n- The furnace at (18.0, 75.0) frequently has full output inventory, stopping smelting progress.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept smelted iron plates and ensure continuous item flow downstream.\n\n### Boiler fueling and operation issues\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) was refueled but later reported out of fuel and stopped working.\n- Steam engine depends on boiler operation for power generation.\n- Maintain consistent coal supply to boiler to avoid power interruptions.\n\n### Assembly machine input and crafting failures\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) repeatedly shows empty input and output inventories despite iron plates being inserted into input chest.\n- The machine reports ingredient shortage for iron plates preventing iron gear wheel crafting.\n- Verify correct insertion of iron plates directly into assembler input or ensure inserters are properly configured to feed the assembler.\n- Check recipe settings and assembler status to confirm it is correctly set to craft iron gear wheels.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near (18.0, 75.0) failed due to collisions with mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) or water tiles.\n- To avoid placement errors, verify tile occupancy and consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or selecting alternate nearby positions.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) remain fueled and operational.\n- Previous issues with inserter fuel shortages have been mitigated.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel and source item availability to prevent stoppages.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo new agent-defined functions have been introduced in the recent steps."}
