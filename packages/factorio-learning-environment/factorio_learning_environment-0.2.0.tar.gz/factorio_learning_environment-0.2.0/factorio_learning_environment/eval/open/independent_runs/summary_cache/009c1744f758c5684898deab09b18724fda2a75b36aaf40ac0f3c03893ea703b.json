{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-7.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -7.5, 23.0), offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), and small electric pole (position -5.5, 21.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel, and the offshore pump is working, providing water to the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0). The furnace is currently out of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to access non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access (e.g., lab at position (5.0, 5.0)) actually exists at the specified position before calling the get_entity function.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to fuel supply\n- Ensure that the boiler has sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) before attempting to operate it. Check your inventory for available fuel sources."}
