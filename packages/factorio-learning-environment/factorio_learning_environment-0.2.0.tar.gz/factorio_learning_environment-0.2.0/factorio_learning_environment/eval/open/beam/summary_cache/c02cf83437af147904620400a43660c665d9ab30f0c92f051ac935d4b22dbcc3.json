{"content": "# The crafting attempt for the Burner Mining Drill failed because I am missing the **Iron Gear Wheel**. This component is essential for crafting the drill, and I need to address this before proceeding.\n\n## Next Steps:\n1. **Craft Iron Gear Wheels**: I need to gather enough Iron Plates to craft Iron Gear Wheels, as they are made from Iron Plates.\n2. **Craft the Burner Mining Drill**: Once I have the Iron Gear Wheels, I can proceed to craft the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Recipe\nThe Iron Gear Wheel requires:\n- **2 Iron Plates** per Gear Wheel.\n\n### Current Inventory Status:\n- **Iron Plates**: 61 units\n- **Iron Ore**: 80 units\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Craft Iron Gear Wheels**: I can craft multiple Iron Gear Wheels since I have enough Iron Plates.\n2. **After crafting the required Iron Gear Wheels**, I will check if I can then craft the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Crafting Iron Gear Wheels\nLet's start by crafting the Iron Gear Wheels. I will craft enough to meet the requirement for the Burner Mining Drill (3 Iron Gear Wheels):\n```python\n# Crafting Iron Gear Wheels\niron_gear_wheel_needed = 3  # Number of Iron Gear Wheels needed\niron_plates_per_gear_wheel = 2\ntotal_iron_plates_needed = iron_gear_wheel_needed * iron_plates_per_gear_wheel\n\n# Check if I have enough Iron Plates to craft the required number of Iron Gear Wheels\nif inventory.get('iron-plate', 0) >= total_iron_plates_needed:\n    for _ in range(iron_gear_wheel_needed):\n        craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel)  # Craft Iron Gear Wheel\n    print(f\"Crafted {iron_gear_wheel_needed} Iron Gear Wheels.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough Iron Plates to craft Iron Gear Wheels.\")\n```\n\n### After Crafting\nOnce I have crafted the Iron Gear Wheels, I will check my inventory again to see if I can now craft the Burner Mining Drill. If successful, I will then place the drill at the Iron Ore position. \n\n### Log Updated Inventory\nAfter crafting the Iron Gear Wheels, I will log the updated inventory to ensure I have the necessary components for the drill.", "summary_range": "[1-1610]"}
