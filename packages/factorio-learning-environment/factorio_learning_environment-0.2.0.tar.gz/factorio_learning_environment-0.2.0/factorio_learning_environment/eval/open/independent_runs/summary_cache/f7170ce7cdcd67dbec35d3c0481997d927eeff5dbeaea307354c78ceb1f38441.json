{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), boiler (position not specified), and steam engine (position not specified).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a furnace at position (1.0, 1.0).\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a furnace at position (10.0, 1.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory at position (x=3.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (not specified) and inserter at position (not specified) that puts into assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position not specified) that connects the furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) to the assembling machine at position (not specified).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure there are no blocking entities at the target location before attempting to place an electric pole. If the area is unplaceable (e.g., water), choose a different location.\n\n### Errors when getting entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. If you receive an error stating that no entity of the specified type is found, check the coordinates and ensure the entity has been placed correctly.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The same errors regarding electric pole placement and entity retrieval have occurred multiple times. Consistently check for blocking entities and ensure the correct positioning of structures to avoid these issues."}
