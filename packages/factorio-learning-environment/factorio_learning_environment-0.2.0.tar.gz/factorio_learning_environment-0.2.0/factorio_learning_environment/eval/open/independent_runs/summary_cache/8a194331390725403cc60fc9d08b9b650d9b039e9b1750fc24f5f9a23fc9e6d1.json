{"content": "```\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Insufficient resources\n- The agent attempts to craft items without having enough resources in its inventory. Ensure sufficient resources are available before attempting to craft. For example, the agent attempts to craft when it does not have enough iron ore or wooden chests.\n\n### Inserter blocked\n- The agent places a transport belt in a way that blocks an inserter. Ensure that inserters have a clear path to transfer items to and from belts and machines.\n- The inserter already has fuel, so it cannot be inserted with fuel. Check if the inserter already has fuel before inserting.\n- Multiple inserters are blocked by transport belts. Check the placement of transport belts around inserters at (40.5, -80.5), (6.5, -57.5), and (8.5, -57.5) to ensure they are not blocked.\n\n### Harvesting errors\n- The agent attempts to harvest wood but encounters an error related to movement and string indices. This suggests an issue with pathfinding or target selection during the harvesting process. Ensure the agent can move to the target wood and that the target is correctly identified.\n\n### Transport belt removal\n- The agent attempts to interact with a transport belt that is no longer present at the expected location. Before interacting with a transport belt, verify that it still exists at the intended location.\n\nNAMESPACE\n```"}
