{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes at positions: (-48.5, -122.5), (-47.5, -122.5), (-48.5, -120.5), (-48.5, -121.5), (-48.5, -118.5), (-48.5, -119.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes at positions: (-46.5, -120.5), (-44.5, -120.5), (-45.5, -120.5), ..., (-41.5, -119.5), (-40.5, -116.5), (-40.5, -117.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (-44.5, -119.5) connecting to the steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items between entities\n- Wooden Chests at positions (6.5, -59.5) and (7.5, -61.5) for storing processed materials\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting copper ore\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Multiple Pipe Groups and Electricity Groups for fluid and power distribution across the facility\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between entities. Verify the starting and ending positions of pipes to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors with Empty or Full Inventories\n- Regularly check and manage inventories of entities like chests and furnaces to prevent them from becoming full or running out of required materials.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities such as boilers and burner mining drills are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Verify that inserters have a clear path and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items between entities.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended structure to avoid placement errors."}
