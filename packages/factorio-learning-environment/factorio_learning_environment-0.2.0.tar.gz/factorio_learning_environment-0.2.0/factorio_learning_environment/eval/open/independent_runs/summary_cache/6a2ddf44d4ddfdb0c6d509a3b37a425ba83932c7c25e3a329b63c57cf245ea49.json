Regularly check your inventory levels to prevent interruptions in furnace operations.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests Blocking Mining Operations\n- Regularly empty chests that are used as drop points for mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting mining operations. Consider using inserters to automate the transfer of items from full chests to other storage or processing units.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination of inserters has enough space to receive items. If the destination is a furnace or another processing unit, make sure it is not blocked or full.\n\n### General Tips for Efficient Resource Management\n- Continuously monitor the status of all entities, especially those involved in resource extraction and processing, to ensure they are operating efficiently and without interruptions."}
