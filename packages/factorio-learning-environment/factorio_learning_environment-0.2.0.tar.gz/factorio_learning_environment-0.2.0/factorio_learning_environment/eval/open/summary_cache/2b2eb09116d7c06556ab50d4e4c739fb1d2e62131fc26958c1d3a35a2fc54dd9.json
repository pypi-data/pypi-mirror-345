{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (18.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a mining and smelting structure for iron ore to iron plates:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 73.5) transferring iron plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates output from the inserter\n\nThis structure is fueled by coal inserted into the drill, furnace, and inserter to maintain operation. The burner mining drill outputs iron ore to the furnace, which smelts it into iron plates. The burner inserter moves the iron plates into the wooden chest for collection.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities overlapping existing ones\n- When placing the burner inserter next to the furnace at (16.0, 73.0), placement failed due to the wooden chest already occupying the intended tile at (17.5, 73.0).\n- To avoid this, check for existing entities at the target placement position before placing new entities.\n- Increase spacing, change placement direction, or adjust reference position to find a free tile for the inserter.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items warning\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 73.5) repeatedly showed status WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS because the furnace output was empty or no items were available to pick up.\n- Ensure the furnace has sufficient input iron ore and is actively smelting to provide output items for the inserter.\n- Check that the mining drill is outputting iron ore properly and that the furnace inventory is being filled.\n\n### Output blocked warning on burner mining drill\n- The burner mining drill at (16.0, 71.0) had a warning about output blocked by item on the ground due to no sink entity accepting its output.\n- This indicates the furnace is not pulling iron ore from the drill fast enough or the drill output position is not properly aligned with the furnace input.\n- Verify inserter or direct insertion from drill to furnace is correctly set up to avoid output blockage.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the provided steps."}
