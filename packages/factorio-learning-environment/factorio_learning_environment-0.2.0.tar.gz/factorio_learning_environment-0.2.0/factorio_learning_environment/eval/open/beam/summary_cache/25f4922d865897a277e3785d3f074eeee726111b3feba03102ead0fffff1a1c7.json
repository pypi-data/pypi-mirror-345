{"content": "The attempt to retrieve available crafting recipes resulted in an error, specifically stating that it could not get the recipe for **express-inserter**. This indicates that there may be a problem with accessing certain recipes or that the prototype list may not be correctly defined.\n\n### Summary of Issues:\n1. **Research Error**: The attempt to research **Logistics** failed because it was already researched.\n2. **Recipe Retrieval Error**: The attempt to get available recipes failed due to an issue with accessing specific prototypes, which suggests that the method used to retrieve recipes may not be correctly implemented or that certain prototypes are not available in the current context.\n\n### Recommendations for Next Steps:\n1. **Check Available Prototypes**: Before attempting to retrieve recipes, ensure that the list of prototypes is correctly defined and accessible. This could involve checking the available prototypes manually or using a different method to list them.\n2. **Use Safe Access Methods**: When accessing recipes, consider using a try-except block to handle potential errors gracefully, allowing the program to continue running even if some recipes cannot be accessed.\n3. **Explore Other Technologies**: If logistics is already researched, consider researching other foundational technologies such as **Electronics** or **Steel Processing**, which could unlock new crafting options.\n\n### Example of Safe Access Method:\n```python\n# Attempt to safely retrieve recipes\navailable_recipes = []\nfor prototype in Prototype:\n    try:\n        recipe = get_prototype_recipe(prototype)\n        available_recipes.append(recipe)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not retrieve recipe for {prototype}: {e}\")\n\nprint(f\"Successfully retrieved recipes: {available_recipes}\")\n```\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Implement the safe access method to check for available recipes.\n2. If successful, assess which recipes are available and plan the next research step accordingly. \n\nLet's proceed with the safe access method to retrieve the recipes. \n```python\n# Attempt to safely retrieve available recipes\navailable_recipes = []\nfor prototype in Prototype:\n    try:\n        recipe = get_prototype_recipe(prototype)\n        available_recipes.append(recipe)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not retrieve recipe for {prototype}: {e}\")\n\nprint(f\"Successfully retrieved recipes: {available_recipes}\")  # Print the successfully retrieved recipes.\n```", "summary_range": "[1-228]"}
