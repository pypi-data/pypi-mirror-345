{"content": "I see there's a persistent issue with the furnace being full but showing empty contents. Let's analyze what we've learned and try a different approach:\n\n1. Current State:\n- We have a drill at (19.0, -17.0)\n- We have a furnace at (21.0, -17.0)\n- The furnace appears full but shows empty inventory\n- The drill has coal but shows \"nothing to mine\"\n\n2. Issues Identified:\n- The furnace inventory system seems to be in an inconsistent state\n- The drill isn't over minable resources\n- We can't insert items into the furnace due to it being full\n\nLet's try to fix the drill position first since that's our source of iron:\n\n```python\n# First find iron ore\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Found iron ore at {iron_pos}\")\n\n# Get our drill\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Current drill position: {drill.position}\")\n\n# If drill isn't over iron ore, move it\nif drill.status == EntityStatus.NO_MINABLE_RESOURCES:\n    print(\"Drill needs to be moved to iron ore\")\n    # Pick up the drill\n    move_to(drill.position)\n    pickup_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, drill.position)\n    print(\"Picked up drill\")\n    \n    # Move to iron ore and place drill\n    if iron_pos:\n        move_to(iron_pos)\n        drill = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, position=iron_pos, direction=Direction.RIGHT)\n        print(f\"Placed drill at {drill.position}\")\n        \n        # Add fuel to drill\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n        \n        # Wait for mining\n        print(\"Waiting for drill to mine...\")\n        sleep(5)\n        print(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\n        print(f\"Drill inventory: {inspect_inventory(drill)}\")\n\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should help us get the drill properly positioned over iron ore so we can get a fresh supply of ore to work with.", "summary_range": "[1-3552]"}
