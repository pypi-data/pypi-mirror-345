{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with coal as fuel. The furnace has warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\". It has produced 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Group at position (-12.5, 21.5)\n- A series of connected pipes forming a fluid system, with positions at:\n  - (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=23.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Group\n- Consists of electric poles with positions at:\n  - (x=-6.5, y=16.5)\n  - (x=-8.5, y=17.5)\n  - (x=-8.5, y=16.5)\n  - ... (additional positions omitted for brevity)\n  - (x=-1.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=1.5, y=20.5)\n  - (x=0.5, y=21.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving to a new area\n- Ensure that the indices used for movement are integers, not strings. Verify the data type before attempting to move.\n\n### Errors when placing offshore pump\n- Confirm that the position for placing an offshore pump is suitable. Check the terrain and surrounding area to ensure compatibility.\n\n### Errors when placing boiler and steam engine\n- Verify that the positions for placing boilers and steam engines are suitable. Ensure there is enough space and the terrain is appropriate for placement.\n\n### Connection errors between offshore pump and boiler\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump and boiler. Check the alignment and connectivity of the pipes.\n\n### Errors in connecting electric poles\n- Make sure electric poles are placed correctly to establish connections. Verify the placement and ensure there are no obstacles preventing connectivity."}
