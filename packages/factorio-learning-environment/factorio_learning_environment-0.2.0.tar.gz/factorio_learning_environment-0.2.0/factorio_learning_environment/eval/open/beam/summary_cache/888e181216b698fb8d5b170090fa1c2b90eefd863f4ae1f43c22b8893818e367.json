{"content": "Ah, I see the issue now. We need to craft the burner mining drill first. Let's do this step by step:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\nprint(f\"Starting inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Craft iron gear wheels first (needed for burner mining drill)\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=5)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting gears: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Get recipe for burner mining drill\nrecipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\nprint(f\"Burner mining drill recipe: {recipe}\")\n\n# Craft the burner mining drill\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, quantity=1)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting drill: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Now find iron ore and place the drill\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# Place the mining drill\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=iron_pos,\n    direction=Direction.DOWN\n)\n\nif drill:\n    # Add fuel to drill\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=10)\n    print(f\"Placed and fueled drill at: {drill.position}\")\n    \n    # Place transport belt at drill's output\n    belt = place_entity(\n        Prototype.TransportBelt,\n        position=drill.drop_position,\n        direction=Direction.DOWN\n    )\n    \n    if belt:\n        print(f\"Placed transport belt at: {belt.position}\")\n        \n        # Place furnace at end of belt\n        furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n            Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n            reference_position=belt.position,\n            direction=Direction.DOWN,\n            spacing=1\n        )\n        \n        if furnace:\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=10)\n            print(f\"Placed and fueled furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Final entities: {get_entities()}\")\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Craft the necessary iron gear wheels\n2. Craft the burner mining drill\n3. Place and fuel the drill\n4. Add transport belt and furnace\n5. Fuel everything properly\n\nThe key insight was that we needed to craft the burner mining drill before trying to place it. Let's see if this works better.", "summary_range": "[1-256]"}
