{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-11.5, 26.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-11.5, 26.5)\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 18.0) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'No fluid present in connections'\n- Steam Engine at position (-2.5, 22.5)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (4.0, -60.0) with coal as fuel and iron plates as a result, currently with 'no ingredients to smelt'\n- Furnace at position (5.0, -60.0) with coal as fuel and iron plates as a result, currently with 'no ingredients to smelt'\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -84.0) dropping into a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -85.5) containing coal, currently out of fuel\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) dropping into a Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal\n\n### Electrical Infrastructure\n- Multiple Electricity Groups with poles at various positions, all with zero voltage, indicating they are not currently powered\n\n### Additional Observations\n- An Electric Mining Drill at position (-15.5, -50.5) not receiving electricity\n- A Lab not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Reconnecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure you have enough pipes in your inventory to connect the offshore pump to the boiler. Verify that you have enough iron plates to craft additional pipes if necessary.\n- Avoid placing pipes where the entity footprint overlaps water. Adjust the path to find a suitable location for pipe placement.\n\n### Errors with Fueling Mining Drills\n- Check that all burner mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Refill them with coal or another suitable fuel source to avoid operational downtime.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are connected to a power source and that the power source is operational to provide the necessary electricity.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply lines and ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Electric Mining Drill Not Receiving Power\n- Connect the electric mining drill to a power network that is operational. Ensure that the power network is connected to a functional power source.\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Item Insertion\n- Ensure that when inserting items, the target is a valid entity or entity group. Avoid using positions directly in the insert_item function.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities.\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Entity Attribute Access\n- When accessing entity attributes, ensure that you are using the correct attribute names. For example, use 'StoneFurnace' instead of 'Furnace' when accessing furnace entities.\n\n### Errors with Inserting Non-Existent Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the items exist in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items before attempting actions that require specific resources.\n\n### Errors with Coal Insertion\n- Ensure that you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into burner mining drills.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Ensure that there is enough space and no overlapping entities when placing new structures. Adjust positions to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that the connection points for pipes are not blocked by other entities. Adjust the positions of entities to unblock connections and verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory to complete the connections.\n\n### Errors with Crafting Insufficient Pipes\n- Make sure to have enough iron plates to craft the required number of pipes for connecting entities. Regularly check your inventory and resource availability.\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Placement of Steam Engine\n- Verify the position before placing a steam engine to ensure it is not obstructed by other entities. Adjust placement to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Connection Points\n- Failed to verify connection due to blocked connection points. Adjust the positions of entities to unblock connections.\n\n### Errors with Picking Up Non-Existent Pipes\n- Ensure the pipe exists at the specified location before attempting to pick it up. Double-check the position to avoid errors."}
