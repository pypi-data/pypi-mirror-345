{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) - extracts crude oil (currently without power)\n- Storage tank at (22.5, 40.5) - stores extracted crude oil\n- Pipe network connecting pumpjack to storage tank (positions: (19.5,38.5), (18.5,38.5), (21.5,38.5), (20.5,38.5))\n\n### Partial Power Plant at (17.5, 31.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (17.5, 31.0) - currently not functional (missing steam engine and water input)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement errors\n- Cannot place steam engines on water or occupied tiles - carefully check terrain before placement\n- Offshore pumps must be placed adjacent to water - verify water presence at target location\n- Entities must be placed within 10 tiles of player position - move closer before placing\n\n### Inspection errors\n- Storage tanks show empty when inspected - this is normal before fluid systems are fully operational\n- Pumpjack shows NO_POWER status - needs to be connected to a powered electrical network\n\n### Power plant construction\n- Steam engines must be placed adjacent to boilers with proper alignment\n- Boilers require both fuel input and water connection to function\n- Complete power plants need all components: offshore pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine\n\n### General tips\n- When removing misplaced entities, check inventory to confirm successful removal\n- For fluid systems, verify all pipe connections are properly linked\n- Check entity status messages for specific operational issues"}
