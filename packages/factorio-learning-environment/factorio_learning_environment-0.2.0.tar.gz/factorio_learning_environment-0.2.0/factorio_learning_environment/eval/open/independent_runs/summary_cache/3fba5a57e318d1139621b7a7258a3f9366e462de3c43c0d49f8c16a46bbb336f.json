{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel (0 coal) and input (9 iron plates). It has produced 9 iron plates and is currently idle due to a lack of fuel and iron ore.\n\n### Coal Storage at position (40.5, -82.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Coal resource patch (position (40.5, -82.5)) from which 20 coal has been harvested in total.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inventory contains 30 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inventory contains 10 iron ore.\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inventory contains 28 iron gear wheels.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to craft entities. In this case, there were not enough resources to craft Iron Gear Wheels due to insufficient Iron Plates.\n- Always check your inventory for required items before executing crafting actions to avoid running into resource shortages.\n- If an assertion error occurs indicating a lack of items, verify your inventory and ensure you have the necessary components before proceeding with actions that depend on those items.\n- When attempting to craft items that require sub-ingredients (e.g., Iron Gear Wheel requires Iron Plate), ensure you have the means to produce those sub-ingredients, such as a furnace or crafting machine.\n- Ensure that the furnace has enough fuel and input materials before starting the smelting process to avoid smelting timeouts.\n- Be mindful of the furnace inventory to avoid extracting more items than available.\n- When checking required ingredients for crafting, ensure you have enough of each required component to avoid crafting failures.\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace for fuel.\n- Verify that you are aware of the current inventory levels to avoid confusion when managing resources, especially after harvesting.\n- Ensure that the furnace has sufficient input materials (iron ore) before attempting to smelt to avoid idle time.\n- Ensure you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace, as indicated by the recent error when trying to insert iron ore.\n- After inserting iron ore into the furnace, ensure to monitor the inventory to confirm the correct amount of resources is available for future actions.\n- Ensure you have enough iron plates in your inventory before crafting iron gear wheels to avoid running out of materials.\n- Ensure you have sufficient inventory space when harvesting resources to avoid losing items.\n- Ensure the furnace has ingredients to smelt; otherwise, it will remain idle and not produce any items, as indicated by the recent warning of \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n- Verify that the variable names used in your code are correctly defined to avoid NameErrors, such as the recent error with 'nearest_ironOre_position'.\n- Monitor the furnace's output to ensure it is functioning correctly and producing the expected items.\n- Address the smelting timeout error by ensuring that the furnace has both sufficient fuel and input materials before attempting to smelt again.\n- Ensure you have coal available in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace, as indicated by the error message stating \"No coal available to insert into the furnace.\"\n- Ensure to monitor the furnace's fuel levels to prevent running out of coal during operation.\n- Ensure that the item stack count is a positive integer when inserting items into entities, as indicated by the error when attempting to re-insert coal.\n- Ensure to replenish the coal supply regularly to maintain furnace operation and avoid idle states."}
