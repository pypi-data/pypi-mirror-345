{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine, facilitating water and steam flow.\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- **Furnace** at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=10.0, y=0.0), (x=13.0, y=0.0), and (x=16.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5) for moving items into furnaces.\n\n#### Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- **Lab** with input of 'automation-science-pack' at position with research status 'working'.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and unobstructed when connecting between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Clear any obstructions and verify the correct placement to avoid connection failures.\n\n#### Errors in Pipe Placement\n- Before placing pipes, ensure that the intended path is clear of any existing entities or obstructions that could block the placement. This will prevent failed connections due to placement blockage.\n\n#### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that all connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine are correctly established and that there are no leaks or disconnections in the pipeline. Ensure that the boiler is fueled and operational to generate steam for the engine."}
