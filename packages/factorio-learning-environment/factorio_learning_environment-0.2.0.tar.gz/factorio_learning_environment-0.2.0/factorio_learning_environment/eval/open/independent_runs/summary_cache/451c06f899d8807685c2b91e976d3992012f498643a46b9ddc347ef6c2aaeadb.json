The steam engine is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction and Basic Refining\n*   **Purpose:** Extracts crude oil and refines it into petroleum gas.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   PumpJack at (x=17.5, y=40.5)\n    *   Oil Refinery at (x=24.5, y=44.5) (Set to Basic Oil Processing)\n    *   Storage Tank at (x=34.5, y=47.5) for petroleum gas.\n    *   Pipes connecting the PumpJack to the Oil Refinery (crude oil input).\n    *   Pipes connecting the Oil Refinery to the Storage Tank (petroleum gas output).\n    *   Small Electric Poles connecting the Steam Engine (power source) to the PumpJack and Oil Refinery.\n*   **Note:** The PumpJack and Oil Refinery are currently not powered (Status: NO\\_POWER), likely because the Steam Engine is not connected or the Boiler is out of fuel.\n\n### Coal Mining for Boiler (Attempted Setup)\n*   **Purpose:** To mine coal and automatically feed it into the Boiler.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Burner Mining Drill at (x=16.0, y=0.0) placed on a coal patch.\n    *   Burner Inserter placed at (x=-6.5, y=2.5) intended to feed the Boiler. (Picked up in Step 7)\n    *   Transport Belts (Attempted placement between drill drop point (x=15.5, y=-1.5) and inserter pickup point (x=-7.5, y=2.5)).\n"}
