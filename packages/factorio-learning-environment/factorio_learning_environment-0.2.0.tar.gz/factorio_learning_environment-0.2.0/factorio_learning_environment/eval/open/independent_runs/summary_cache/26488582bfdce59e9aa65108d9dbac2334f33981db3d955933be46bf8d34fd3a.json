{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System (around x=40, y=-82)\nAutomated coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (40.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt line running from y=-83.5 to y=-86.5 at x=39.5\n- Fuel inserter at (38.5, -84.5) maintaining drill fuel\n- Output collection inserter at (38.5, -86.5)\n- Collection chest at (39.5, -87.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility (around x=45-47, y=-80)\nTwo parallel smelting lines consisting of:\n- Stone furnaces at (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\n- Output inserters at (45.5, -81.5) and (47.5, -81.5)\n- Collection chests at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5)\n- Input inserters at (45.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5)\n- Input chests at (45.5, -77.5) and (47.5, -77.5)\n\n### Storage Area\n- Coal storage chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 800 coal\n- Mixed storage chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly to wooden chests - use inserters instead\n- When building automated systems, ensure proper spacing between components to allow for inserter movement\n- Keep track of chest capacities - several chests are showing \"chest is full\" warnings\n- Monitor furnace fuel levels and input materials - furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- When placing belts, maintain consistent direction to ensure proper flow\n\n# NAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- mining_drill_status: EntityStatus\n- fuel_levels: Dictionary[str, int]\n- belt_positions: List[Position]\n- inserter_positions: List[Position]\n\nFunctions:\n- connect_entities(): Failed when attempting to connect belts to wooden chest\n- create_belt_line(): Successfully created transport belt lines with consistent direction\n- fix_inserter_rotation(): Successfully reoriented inserters for proper material flow"}
