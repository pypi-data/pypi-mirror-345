{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled with coal  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal  \n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace, fueled with coal  \n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine, fueled with coal  \n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine, fueled with coal  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels (currently empty and reported full warnings)  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, currently without power and missing iron plates in input inventory  \n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters, but assembler remains unpowered  \n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, the assembling machine is not receiving power despite poles being placed and connected, and the wooden chest is full or placement attempts failed due to inventory shortage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power  \n- Assembling machines report no power despite electric poles being placed and connected. This indicates incomplete or incorrect power network connections.  \n- Verify that all electric poles are properly connected in a continuous power network and that the assembler is within pole coverage.  \n- Check that poles have sufficient energy and connections to the assembler and inserters.  \n- Confirm that the assembler\u2019s electric connection points align with the poles\u2019 coverage area.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters and assembling machines  \n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into burner inserters failed due to \"No coal to insert from your inventory,\" despite harvesting coal moments before. This suggests inventory management issues or timing conflicts in inserting items.  \n- Ensure that harvested coal is correctly added to the player inventory before attempting insertion.  \n- Avoid simultaneous insert attempts that may deplete coal before all inserters receive fuel.  \n- Implement checks for coal availability before insertion commands to prevent exceptions.\n\n### Errors placing wooden chests due to inventory shortage  \n- Attempts to place wooden chests at furnace output positions failed due to \"No wooden_chest in inventory.\"  \n- Confirm inventory contains required entities before placement attempts.  \n- Manage inventory to maintain a reserve of essential entities like chests for placement and expansion.  \n- Consider picking up or crafting more chests if needed before placement.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs and full inventories  \n- Burner mining drill reports output blocked by items on the ground due to no sink entity accepting output.  \n- Stone furnace shows warnings of full source and full result inventories, indicating output is not being consumed or moved.  \n- Wooden chest is reported full, causing inserters to wait for space in destination.  \n- Ensure continuous flow of items from furnaces to assembling machines and chests to prevent backups.  \n- Monitor inserter and chest capacities and adjust belt or inserter configurations to maintain throughput.\n\n### General placement and power network tips (from previous report)  \n- Always verify target tiles are free before placing entities to avoid collisions.  \n- Confirm inventory contains the entity type before placement attempts.  \n- Follow correct connection hierarchies: inserters between furnaces and belts, poles connected in a network covering all electric entities.  \n- Regularly check power network connectivity and energy levels to avoid production halts.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
