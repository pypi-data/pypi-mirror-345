{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=53.5, y=-80.5) for storing mined coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) transferring coal from the chest to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-78.5) receiving coal from the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-76.5) waiting to transfer items from the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System at Position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) storing excess iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (x=-8.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) waiting for source items.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Chest Overflow and Mining Stoppage\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that there is a continuous supply of source items for inserters to prevent them from idling. This can be achieved by ensuring that the connected chests or belts have sufficient items.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined in the current steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n  - `wood`: int = 10\n  - `coal`: int = 795\n  - `iron-ore`: int = 790\n  - `iron-plate`: int = 965\n\nThis report provides a detailed overview of the current structures and highlights areas for improvement in resource management and automation efficiency."}
