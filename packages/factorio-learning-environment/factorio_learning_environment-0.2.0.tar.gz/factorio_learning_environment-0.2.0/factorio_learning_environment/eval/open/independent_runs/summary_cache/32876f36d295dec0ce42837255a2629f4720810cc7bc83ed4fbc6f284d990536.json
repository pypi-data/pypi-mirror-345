{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that converts iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the produced iron plates.\nUpdates:\n- At steps 38\u201340, the furnace produced and had 2+2 iron plates extracted with fuel adjustments.\n- At step 42, after waiting 10 seconds, the furnace produced an additional 5 iron plates which were extracted.\n- At step 43, 10 iron ore were inserted into the same furnace to resume smelting.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resource availability and incorrect inventory checks\n- Verify resource presence in the inventory before inserting into an entity. Always confirm the expected resource (e.g., coal, iron ore) is available to avoid failures.\n\n### Errors related to timing in processing cycles and smelting timeouts\n- Allow sufficient processing time for smelting operations to complete. If additional iron plates are not produced within the expected period, adjust waiting periods or verify fuel and production settings.\n\n### Repeated mistakes with resource assertions\n- Check inventories and resource patches prior to operations to ensure that the required amounts are accessible, thereby preventing assertion failures."}
