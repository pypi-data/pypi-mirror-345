For example, avoid inserting iron plates into a furnace that contains iron ore.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a non-existent or empty container\n- Verify the existence and content of the container before attempting to extract items. Ensure the container has the required items available for extraction.\n\n### Inserter operation errors\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to transfer items and that their source and destination are accessible. Check that inserters are not blocked by full destination containers or lack of source items."}
