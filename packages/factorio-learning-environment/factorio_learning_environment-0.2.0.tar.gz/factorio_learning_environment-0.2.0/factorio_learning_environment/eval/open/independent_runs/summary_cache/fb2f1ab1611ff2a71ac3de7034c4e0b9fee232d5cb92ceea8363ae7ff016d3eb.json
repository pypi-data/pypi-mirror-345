{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 56-63)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Functional Power Plant at (-9.5, 0.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) facing right (working, water output)\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 1.5) facing right (28 coal, producing steam)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 1.5) facing right (working, power output 14.7kW)\n- Small electric pole at (-2.5, 3.5) (connected to power network)\n- Connected pipe network for water and steam transport\n\n### Smelting and Production Complex\n- Iron smelting furnace at (5.0, 0.0) (13 coal, no iron ore, status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Copper smelting furnace at (5.0, 4.0) (49 coal, no copper ore, status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Gear assembler at (8.5, 0.5) (powered, missing iron plates)\n- Cable assembler at (8.5, 4.5) (powered, missing copper plates)\n- Science assembler at (12.5, 2.5) (powered, missing both copper plates and gear wheels)\n- Inserters at (6.5, 0.5), (6.5, 4.5), and (10.5, 0.5) (all powered but waiting for items)\n\n### Power Distribution Network\n- Multiple small electric poles forming complete power network\n- All production buildings properly connected to grid\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues\n- Repeated attempts to place entities without proper positioning:\n  - Ensure player is within 10 tiles of target position before placement\n  - Implement distance checks before placement attempts\n  - Move to target area before building operations\n\n### Entity Collision Problems\n- Multiple failed attempts to place wooden chest at (13.5, 2.5):\n  - Verify position is completely clear before placement\n  - Remove any existing entities or debris first\n  - Consider alternative nearby positions if primary is blocked\n\n### Production Chain Management\n- Iron furnace remains without ore despite available inventory:\n  - Implement proper ore insertion system\n  - Ensure inserters are correctly positioned and powered\n  - Verify transport belts are properly connected\n\n### General Improvements\n- Implement systematic clearing of build areas before placement\n- Add position validation checks before all placement operations\n- Create dedicated output areas with pre-cleared spaces\n- Monitor and maintain proper spacing between production buildings\n\n### Power System Maintenance\n- Boiler fuel level decreasing (now at 28 coal):\n  - Implement automated coal replenishment system\n  - Monitor fuel levels and refill before depletion\n  - Consider expanding power generation capacity"}
