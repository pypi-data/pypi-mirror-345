Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as 'radius') and ensure that parameter order and types match the API specification.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Failures\n  - Verify that a lab exists in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n  - Ensure that all required recipe sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) are available in sufficient quantities to allow lab crafting.\n  - Guard against iterating over a None value when retrieving entities by handling empty or null responses appropriately.\n\n\u2022 Resource and Process Verification\n  - Confirm that requisite resources are processed (via smelting or other production methods) to meet crafting requirements before triggering lab production actions."}
