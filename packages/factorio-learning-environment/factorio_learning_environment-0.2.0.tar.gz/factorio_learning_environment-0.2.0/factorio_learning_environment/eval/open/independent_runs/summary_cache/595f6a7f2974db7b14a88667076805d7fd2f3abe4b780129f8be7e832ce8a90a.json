{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) connected to Wooden Chests at Positions (x=-3.5, y=0.5) and (x=-3.5, y=2.5)\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Copper Ore Mining at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Multiple Pipe Groups and Electricity Poles for fluid and power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, the attempt to place a Burner Mining Drill at (19.5, 19.5) failed due to lack of inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to Output Blockage\n- Ensure there is a destination entity to accept the output from mining drills or other production entities to prevent blockage. For instance, the Burner Mining Drill at (20.0, 20.0) is waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers and mining drills to maintain continuous operation. The boiler at (20.5, y=-4.0) and the mining drill at (x=-11.0, y=20.0) are out of fuel.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Ensure that all necessary resources are available for production processes. The assembling machine at (x=10.5, y=0.5) cannot create copper cables due to missing copper plates.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure all electrical entities are connected to a power source and that the power network is active. Several entities, including inserters and assembling machines, are not receiving electricity."}
