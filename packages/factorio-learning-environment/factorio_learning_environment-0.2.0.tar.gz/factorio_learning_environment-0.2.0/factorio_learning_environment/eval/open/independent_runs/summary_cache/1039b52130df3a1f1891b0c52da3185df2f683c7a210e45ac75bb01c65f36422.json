{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Current status: Working with fuel (coal: 2) and smelting iron ore (19 units).\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) used to transfer iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest. Pickup position: (0.5, 0.5), Drop position: (2.5, 0.5). Current status: Waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates. Current inventory: 19 iron plates.\n\n### Transport and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) used to transfer items from the wooden chest to a transport belt. Pickup position: (2.5, 0.5), Drop position: (4.5, 0.5). Current status: Working.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5). Used for transporting iron plates. Current inventory on belts: 6 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) used to transfer items from the transport belt to another wooden chest. Pickup position: (5.5, 0.5), Drop position: (7.5, 0.5). Current status: Working.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the belt. Current inventory: 17 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is unoccupied. If a burner inserter or any other entity already exists at the intended position, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or altering the reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- You cannot connect belts directly from a wooden chest. Use an inserter to extract items from the chest before placing them on a belt.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure you have the required items in your inventory. For example, inserting coal into a burner inserter requires coal in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting without raw resources\n- Some items require raw resources that must be gathered manually. For instance, crafting a wooden chest requires wood, which is a raw resource that must be harvested. Ensure you have gathered the necessary raw materials before crafting.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without inventory stock\n- Verify that you have the necessary entities in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map. For example, placing a wooden chest requires having a wooden chest in your inventory."}
