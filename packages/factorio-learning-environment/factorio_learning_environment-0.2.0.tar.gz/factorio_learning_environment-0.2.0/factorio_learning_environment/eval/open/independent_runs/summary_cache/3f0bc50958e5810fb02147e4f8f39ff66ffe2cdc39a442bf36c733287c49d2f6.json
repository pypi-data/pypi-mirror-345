{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Complex at (0,0) to (4,4)\nConsists of multiple furnaces for iron plate production:\n- Stone furnace at (0,0) - currently inactive\n- Stone furnace at (2,0) - active with coal fuel, producing iron plates\n- Stone furnace at (4,4) - has full coal storage but inactive\n- Stone furnace at (6,4) - currently inactive\n\n### Automation Assembly Line at (20.5,2.5)\nComplex for automated inserter production:\n- Wooden chest at (20.5,2.5) storing 25 inserters\n- Assembling machine at (23.5,2.5) configured for inserter production\n- Two burner inserters at (21.5,2.5) and (25.5,2.5) for material movement\n- Output wooden chest at (26.5,2.5)\n\n### Science Pack Production at (32.5,5.5)\n- Assembling machine configured for logistic science pack production\n- Connected to electrical network\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around (-2.5,24.0):\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,24.5) producing water\n- Boiler at (-2.5,24.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5,24.5)\n- Extensive pipe network connecting water and steam flow\n- Electric pole network distributing power\n\n### Research Complex\nMultiple labs distributed across the map, currently inactive but containing:\n- One lab with 29 automation science packs\n- One lab with 12 automation science packs and 40 logistic science packs\n- Several other labs with empty inventories\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available before attempting to insert into boilers\n- Keep track of iron plate production and maintain adequate supply for crafting operations\n\n### Production Chain Errors\n- Electronic circuit crafting fails due to missing iron plates - ensure iron smelting is operational before attempting electronic circuit production\n- Cannot produce logistic science packs due to missing components (transport belts and inserters) - ensure all prerequisites are available\n\n### Research Prerequisites\n- Cannot research advanced-material-processing without completing steel-processing first\n- Cannot research logistics-2 without completing logistics first\n- Ensure research prerequisites are met before attempting to set new research\n\n### Power Issues\n- Assembling machines showing LOW_POWER status - ensure power generation and distribution system is properly connected and operational\n- Steam engine shows NOT_CONNECTED status - verify steam pipe connections are properly configured\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- Steam system showing disconnection issues - ensure proper pipe connections between boiler and steam engine\n- Verify electrical connections when placing new machines"}
