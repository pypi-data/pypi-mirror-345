{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) with a wooden chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=20.0, y=20.0) with a wooden chest at position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for copper ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for producing copper cables\n- Inserters at positions (x=13.5, y=0.5) and (x=9.5, y=5.5) for moving items into the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the stone furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) to the assembling machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that all inserters are connected to a power source. Check the connections with electric poles and ensure they are properly linked to the power grid.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine and Boiler Connections\n- Verify that the steam engine and boiler are correctly connected with pipes to ensure fluid flow. Ensure the boiler has fuel and the steam engine is receiving steam.\n\n### Errors with Assembling Machine Not Receiving Resources\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has the necessary resources, such as copper plates, to produce the desired items. Check the input and output logistics to ensure smooth operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the inserters have access to the required source items. Check the supply chain to ensure items are reaching the inserters.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserters is not full and can accommodate the items being moved. Adjust the logistics to prevent bottlenecks."}
