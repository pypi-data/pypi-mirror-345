{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), currently fueled with coal. It is processing copper ore with 49 units remaining and has produced 2 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (20.0, -11.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, -11.0), currently out of fuel. It is set to mine coal with a resource count of 20,000 coal units available.\n- Wooden Chest at position (19.5, -12.5) to collect mined coal. It currently contains 30 units of coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the entity you want to place is available in your inventory before attempting to place it. Craft or acquire the necessary items first.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. Gather or craft the necessary items beforehand.\n\n### Errors related to furnace operation\n- Ensure that the furnace has both fuel and ingredients to smelt. Regularly check the furnace status to confirm it is working. If the furnace is not working, verify that it has the necessary ingredients and fuel to operate efficiently.\n\n### Errors when placing a mining drill without having it in inventory\n- Before attempting to place a mining drill, ensure that you have it in your inventory. If not, craft or acquire the mining drill to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Verify that you have all necessary sub-ingredients before attempting to craft an item. For example, to craft iron gear wheels, ensure you have enough iron plates, which require a furnace for smelting. Check your inventory and production facilities to ensure all components are available.\n\n### Errors when placing a wooden chest without having it in inventory\n- Ensure that you have a wooden chest in your inventory before attempting to place it. If you encounter an error, check your inventory and craft or acquire the wooden chest as needed.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into a mining drill without having it in inventory\n- Make sure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a mining drill. Harvest or acquire the necessary coal to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors when crafting without unlocked technology\n- Before crafting items that require specific technologies, ensure that the necessary technology is researched and unlocked. For example, crafting an assembling machine requires the automation technology.\n\n### Errors when crafting due to insufficient resources\n- Gather all required materials before attempting to craft an item. Check your inventory to ensure you have enough resources, such as iron plates, iron gear wheels, and electronic circuits.\n\n### Errors when placing a lab without having it in inventory\n- Ensure that you have a lab in your inventory before attempting to place it. If you encounter an error, check your inventory and craft or acquire the lab as needed.\n\n### Errors due to assertion failures in furnace operations\n- Ensure that the expected number of items is produced or available in the furnace before making assertions. Regularly monitor the furnace's output to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Errors when inserting incompatible items into a furnace\n- Verify that the furnace is empty or contains compatible items before inserting new materials. Avoid mixing incompatible ores in the furnace to prevent insertion errors.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any entity. In this case, the attempt to insert coal into a mining drill failed due to lack of coal in the inventory."}
