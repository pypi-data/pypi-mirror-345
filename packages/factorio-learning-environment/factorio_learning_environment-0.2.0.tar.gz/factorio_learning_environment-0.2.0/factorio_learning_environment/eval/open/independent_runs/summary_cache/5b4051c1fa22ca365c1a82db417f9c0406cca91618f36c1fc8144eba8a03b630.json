{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, and the map remains empty of any built structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities like Burner Mining Drill, Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, and Stone Furnace is unoccupied and valid for placement.\n\n### Errors related to building box size\n- When attempting to place a Burner Mining Drill, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. Consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if no viable place is found.\n\n### Errors related to missing entities\n- Verify that the Stone Furnace is correctly placed on the map. If the setup is not producing iron plates, check the placement and connections of the Stone Furnace and other related entities.\n\n### General setup errors\n- If the setup is not producing additional iron plates, review the entire setup to ensure all components are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Errors when extracting or interacting with entities\n- Ensure that you are interacting with the correct entity and that the entity exists at the specified position."}
