{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully built. Multiple attempts to place a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5) were made but failed due to placement errors and resource shortages. Although pre\u2010existing furnaces (e.g., one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used for smelting iron and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were retrieved and used in processing, they were not constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for get_entities:\n  - Use the proper invocation form; do not supply unsupported keyword arguments (like \u201cradius\u201d) or excess positional parameters. Verify the API signature to ensure correct argument types and counts.\n  \n\u2022 Placement and inventory verification:\n  - Ensure that a Lab exists in the inventory before attempting to place it. Confirm that the target position is valid and unoccupied.\n  \n\u2022 Handling None values:\n  - Check that variables (such as those returned by get_entities) are not None before iterating over them to avoid type errors.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting resource chain deficiencies:\n  - Verify that all sub-ingredients for Lab crafting (including iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available. Establish production of intermediate items (via smelting or proper crafting) to meet recipe requirements and prevent crafting failures."}
