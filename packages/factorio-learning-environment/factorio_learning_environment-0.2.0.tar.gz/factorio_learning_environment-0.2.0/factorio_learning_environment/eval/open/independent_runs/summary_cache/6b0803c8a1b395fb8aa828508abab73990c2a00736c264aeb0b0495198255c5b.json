{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis structure is designed to transfer iron ore from a wooden chest to a stone furnace for smelting. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and places it into the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. The inserter is refueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position. Misalignment causes the inserter to fail in transferring items.\n- Verify the inserter's drop position is aligned with the intended target, such as a furnace, to ensure successful item transfer.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Check inventory levels before attempting to insert items into entities. Ensure sufficient quantities are available to avoid insertion errors.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve the efficiency and functionality of its structures."}
