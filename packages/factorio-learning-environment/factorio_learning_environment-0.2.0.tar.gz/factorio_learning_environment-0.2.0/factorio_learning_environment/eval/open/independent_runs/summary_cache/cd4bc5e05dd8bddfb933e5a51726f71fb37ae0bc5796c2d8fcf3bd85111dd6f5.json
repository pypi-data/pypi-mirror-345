In these attempts, paths from (-14.5, -48.5) to (-13.5, -53.5) failed normalization; ensure that computed endpoints match the intended targets.\n\n\u2022 Sink Chest Placement and Candidate Computation:\n\u2003\u2013 Directly placing a sink chest at the mining drill drop (\u201314.5, \u201348.5) failed because the tile was not buildable. Always validate the buildability of a candidate tile before placement.\n\u2003\u2013 When computing candidate positions (for example, via a nearest-buildable approach), ensure that properties (like candidate_box.center) are accessed correctly and that the resulting position is manually verified for buildability.\n\n\u2022 Repositioning and Prototype Consistency:\n\u2003\u2013 Repositioning attempts using the shift_entity_local function encountered prototype mismatches (e.g. comparing \"wooden-chest\" with \"WoodenChest\"). Standardize prototype identifiers to prevent such errors.\n\n\u2022 Proximity Requirements:\n\u2003\u2013 Placement actions failing due to distance (the \u201ctoo far\u201d error) were remedied by moving the player closer to the target area. Always ensure proper proximity to the intended build location.\n\n\u2022 General Entity Placement:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the target tile is vacant, within the allowed range, and adheres to the grid before attempting to place any entity.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 shift_entity_local(entity: Entity, offset: Tuple[float, float]) -> Entity  \n\u2003\u2013 Shifts the given entity\u2019s position by the specified offset.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Invocation notes: Used for repositioning sink chests; errors arose when prototype strings did not match expected values.\n\n\u2022 nearest_buildable(position: Position) -> BoundingBox  \n\u2003\u2013 Determines the nearest buildable area around a given position for placement of an entity.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Invocation notes: Incorrect usage (treating candidate_box.center as callable) led to a TypeError; ensure properties are accessed correctly.\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 furnace_input_chest_pos (Position) \u2013 Holds the position of the furnace input chest.\n\u2022 current_player_inventory (Inventory) \u2013 Tracks the current state of the player\u2019s inventory."}
