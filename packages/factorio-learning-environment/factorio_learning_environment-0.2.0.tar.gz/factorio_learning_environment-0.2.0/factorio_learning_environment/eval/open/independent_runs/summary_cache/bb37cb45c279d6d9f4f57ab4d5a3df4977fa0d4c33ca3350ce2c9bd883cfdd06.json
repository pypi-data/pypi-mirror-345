{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with key positions at (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and others forming a loop around the steam engine and boiler.\n\n### Inserter and Power Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5)\n- Connected to power network with poles, ensuring electricity supply to the inserters.\n\n### Furnace and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a status warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5), storing various resources like iron ore and other materials.\n- Inserters positioned to move items between the furnace and chests, though currently experiencing power issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Issues with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes is free of existing entities. Clear any existing pipes before attempting to place new ones.\n- When placing underground pipes, verify that the start and end positions are correctly aligned and free of obstructions.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to the water supply. Check the pipe network for any disconnections or misalignments that may prevent fluid flow.\n\n### Power Supply to Inserters\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a functioning power network. Ensure that all power poles are correctly placed and connected to provide electricity to the inserters.\n\n### General Connectivity Issues\n- Regularly check the status of all entities to ensure they are connected and functioning as intended. Address any warnings or errors promptly to maintain efficient operation."}
