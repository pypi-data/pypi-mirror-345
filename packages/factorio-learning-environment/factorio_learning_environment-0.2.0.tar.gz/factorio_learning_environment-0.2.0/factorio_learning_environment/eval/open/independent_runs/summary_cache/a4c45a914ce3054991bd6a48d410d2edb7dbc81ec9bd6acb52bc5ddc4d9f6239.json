{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) awaiting source items.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the drill to the chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing additional coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) awaiting source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full to continue mining operations. Regularly empty the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to avoid halting the mining process.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has a continuous supply of iron ore to prevent it from running out of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters, particularly for the inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5), which is currently waiting for source items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int, count of wooden chests in inventory.\n- `wood`: int, count of wood in inventory.\n- `iron-ore`: int, count of iron ore in inventory.\n- `iron-plate`: int, count of iron plates in inventory."}
