{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working with iron ore as the source.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) to the iron furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) used for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) transferring items from the wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions from (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5), facilitating the movement of items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring items from the transport belt to a wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Copper Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5) to the copper furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (11.5, 0.5) transferring items from the copper furnace to a wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal and dropping it into a chest at position (40.5, -83.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions from (40.5, -83.5) to (38.5, -83.5), facilitating the movement of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a blocked belt\n- Ensure that the belt is not blocked by other items before attempting to extract items. Clear any blockage to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Make sure the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for space in the destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter. Regularly clear or manage the destination inventory to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- Regularly supply the furnace with the required ingredients to ensure continuous operation. Check the furnace's inventory and replenish it as needed."}
