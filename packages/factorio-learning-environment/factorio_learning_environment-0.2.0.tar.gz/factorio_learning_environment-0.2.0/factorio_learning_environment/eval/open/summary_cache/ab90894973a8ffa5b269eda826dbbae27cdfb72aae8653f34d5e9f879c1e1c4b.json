{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest\n\nThis structure forms a compact iron plate production line where raw iron ore is mined, smelted, and output stored.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters next to occupied tiles\n- When placing an inserter next to another entity (e.g., wooden chest), ensure there is enough spacing or try changing the direction or reference position to avoid overlap.\n- Before placing entities, check the target tile is free to prevent placement exceptions.\n\n### Inserters and drills running out of fuel\n- Inserters and drills require fuel (coal) to operate. Make sure to consistently insert coal into these entities to keep them working.\n- Monitor fuel levels and automate fuel supply if possible to avoid stoppages.\n\n### Inserters waiting for source items or destination space\n- Inserters may show status waiting for source items if the input inventory is empty.\n- Inserters may wait for space in destination if the output inventory (e.g., chest) is full or not accepting items.\n- Ensure continuous supply of input materials and sufficient output storage capacity.\n\n### Attempting to insert items not present in inventory\n- Avoid trying to insert items (e.g., coal) into entities if the agent\u2019s inventory does not contain those items.\n- Check inventory quantities before insertion commands to prevent exceptions.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
