{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Steam Power Plant\nThis structure is designed for generating electricity. It consists of an offshore pump providing water to two boiler-steam engine pairs via a pipe network. The boilers heat the water into steam, which powers the steam engines. The steam engines are connected by power poles to form a basic electrical grid.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0"}
