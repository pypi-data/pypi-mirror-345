{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with coal as fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring items from the mining drill to Furnace 1.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring items between chests and Furnace 1.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring items from Furnace 2 to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for additional storage of iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination inventory has enough space to accommodate items being transferred by the inserter. Consider upgrading storage capacity or managing inventory more efficiently to prevent blockages.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source inventory has items available for the inserter to pick up. Maintain a steady supply of items to prevent production delays.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory. Regularly check and replenish inventory supplies as needed."}
