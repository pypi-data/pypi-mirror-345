{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, with a burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal, feeding it.\n- Burner inserter at (20.5, 75.5) fueled with coal, moving iron plates from furnace to first chest.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation persists.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved power connectivity and inserter fuel status, though output belt blockage remains.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly connected pole at (8.95, 13.05).\n- Boiler and steam engine connected to power network and fueled properly.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 placed at (25.5, 80.5), set to craft iron gear wheels but currently not receiving iron plates, causing ingredient shortage.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5) connected to power network, powering the assembling machine.\n- Input burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding into the assembly area, fueled with coal.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) placed and fueled with coal, moving items to output chest.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) positioned to receive assembling machine output after removal and replacement to free space.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production, now powered and with inserters fueled, but still lacking iron plate input to operate.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous failures placing small electric poles and burner inserters due to tile occupation have been resolved by removing and repositioning chests.\n- Always verify tile availability before placing entities; removing or relocating obstructing entities can help.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Inserters at (20.5, 77.5), (20.5, 75.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are now properly fueled, preventing stoppages.\n- Maintain regular fuel insertion to burner inserters to ensure continuous operation.\n- Avoid overfilling inserter inventories to prevent insertion failures.\n\n### Crafting and recipe input shortages\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) continues to report iron plate ingredient shortage, with input inventory empty.\n- Ensure sufficient iron plates are supplied to the assembling machine input chest at (21.5, 75.5) and transported correctly to the assembler.\n- Monitor input inserter status to confirm items are being moved into the assembler.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory remains full at times, indicating downstream storage or belt congestion.\n- Ensure output belts and chests are cleared regularly and connected properly to accept items.\n- Power network connections have been improved and verified for assembling machine and steam power structures.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent."}
