{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10.0, -59.0)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row, each with a wooden chest:\n- Mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0) with chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0) with chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0) with chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are currently out of fuel but positioned over iron ore deposits.\n\n### Copper/Iron Processing Line at (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-28.5, -58.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing processed plates\n- Additional burner inserter at (-24.5, -57.5)\n\n### Smelting Array at (-23.0, -58.0)\nTwo furnaces with inserters:\n- Stone furnace at (-23.0, -58.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Burner inserters at (-22.5, -59.5) and (-20.5, -59.5)\n- Output chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n\n### Main Smelting Complex at (0.0, 0.0)\nFour parallel smelting lines, each consisting of:\n- Stone furnace (at 0.0/2.0/4.0/6.0, 0.0)\n- Input inserter and chest above (at x.5, -1.5 and x.5, -2.5)\n- Output inserter and chest below (at x.5, 1.5 and x.5, 2.5)\nWhere x is 0, 2, 4, and 6 respectively.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Cannot connect belts directly to furnaces, must use inserters as intermediaries\n- Ensure the path for belt connections is valid and can be normalized\n- Check that the start and end positions for belt connections form a valid path\n\n### Entity placement and connection issues\n- When connecting entities, ensure they are compatible with direct connections\n- Some entities like furnaces require inserters for input/output rather than direct belt connections"}
