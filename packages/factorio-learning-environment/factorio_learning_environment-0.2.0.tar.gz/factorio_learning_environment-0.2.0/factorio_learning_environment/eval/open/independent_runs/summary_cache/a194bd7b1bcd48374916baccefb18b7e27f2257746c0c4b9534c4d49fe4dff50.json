{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions such as (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=1.5, y=21.5)\n- Pipe Group for steam engine connection with pipes at positions such as (x=15.5, y=17.5) and (x=12.5, y=21.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions such as (x=3.5, y=20.5) and (x=14.5, y=20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors between Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine\n- Ensure that there are no placement blockages when connecting pipes between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n- Verify that the correct type of pipes are being used and that they are properly aligned to facilitate fluid flow.\n\n### Placement Errors for Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure there is a suitable position available for placing small electric poles. Check for obstacles or existing structures that might block placement.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `offshore_pump_fluid_systems: List[int]` - Represents the fluid systems connected to the offshore pump, with values such as [31343], [31369], [31399], [31425], [31455], [31481], and [31511].\n- `steam_engine_status: EntityStatus` - Indicates the connection status of the steam engine, which is currently `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED`.\n- `boiler_fluid_systems: Dict` - Represents the fluid systems connected to the boiler, currently empty `{}`."}
