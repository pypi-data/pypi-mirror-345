{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Used for storing extracted iron ore.\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers items between the chests.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from exists and contains the required items before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target tile is occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with incorrect spacing or direction\n- Verify the spacing and direction when placing entities next to others. Adjust these parameters to ensure successful placement without interference from existing structures."}
