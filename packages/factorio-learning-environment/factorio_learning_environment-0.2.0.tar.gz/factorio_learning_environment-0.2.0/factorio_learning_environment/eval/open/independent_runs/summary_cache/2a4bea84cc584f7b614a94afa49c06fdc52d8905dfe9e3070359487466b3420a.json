{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is free from other entities or items. This includes checking the drill's drop position before placing a new entity like a Stone Furnace or Wooden Chest.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Verify the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.5 y=-52.5\".\n\n### Errors when placing Transport Belts\n- Confirm that the desired location for placing a Transport Belt is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserters\n- Check that the intended position for placing a Burner Inserter is available and not obstructed by other entities or items."}
