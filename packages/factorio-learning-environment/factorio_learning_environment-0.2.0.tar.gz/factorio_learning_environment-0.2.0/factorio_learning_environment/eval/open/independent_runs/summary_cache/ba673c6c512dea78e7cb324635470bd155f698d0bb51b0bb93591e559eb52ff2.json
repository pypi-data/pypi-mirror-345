{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with coal as fuel and copper-plate as output.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when crafting automation-science-pack:\n  - Ensure that you have the required ingredients available in the furnace. The recipe for automation-science-pack requires copper-plate, which must be smelted in a furnace. \n  - Check if the furnace has enough copper ore to produce the necessary copper-plate before attempting to craft the automation-science-pack.\n  \n- Errors when inserting items into the furnace:\n  - Make sure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt before inserting fuel. The furnace cannot operate if it lacks the required items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- Utility functions defined:\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to insufficient copper-plate in the furnace.\n\n- Important variables assigned:\n  - `copper-plate: int`\n  - `copper-ore: int`\n  - `coal: int`\n  - `iron-plate: int`\n  - `automation-science-pack: int`"}
