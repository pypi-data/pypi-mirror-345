{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities, although currently not successfully connected.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnaces at Positions (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates.\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) transferring iron plates from the chest to another Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and positioned to connect entities such as boilers and steam engines. Verify that there are no obstructions or misalignments in the intended path of the pipes.\n\n### Errors with Unconnected Entities\n- Check that all entities requiring connections, such as steam engines and boilers, are properly linked to their respective networks. This includes ensuring that all necessary input and output connections are established.\n\n### Errors with Full Output or No Ingredients\n- Regularly check the status of furnaces and other processing entities to ensure they are not stalled due to full output or lack of ingredients. Manage inventories effectively to keep production lines running smoothly.\n\n### Errors with Electrical Connections\n- Verify that all electrical entities, such as inserters, are properly connected to the power network to ensure they receive the necessary electricity to function."}
