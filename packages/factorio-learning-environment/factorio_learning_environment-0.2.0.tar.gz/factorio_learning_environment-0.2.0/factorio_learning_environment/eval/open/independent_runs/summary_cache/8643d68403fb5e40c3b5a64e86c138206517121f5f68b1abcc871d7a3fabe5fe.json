{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, facilitating water and steam flow\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- These furnaces are used to smelt copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n- This furnace is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 1442) at position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) for steam\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 1441) at position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) for water\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 1451) at position (x=18.5, y=-3.5) for water\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=10.5, y=-10.5), (x=16.5, y=-13.5), (x=23.5, y=-12.5), and (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using incorrect entity type or position\n- Ensure that the entity type and position are correct before attempting to access or manipulate an entity. For example, the error \"Could not get Prototype.Lab at position x=22.5 y=-7.5\" indicates that there is no lab at the specified position. Double-check the entity type and position to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
