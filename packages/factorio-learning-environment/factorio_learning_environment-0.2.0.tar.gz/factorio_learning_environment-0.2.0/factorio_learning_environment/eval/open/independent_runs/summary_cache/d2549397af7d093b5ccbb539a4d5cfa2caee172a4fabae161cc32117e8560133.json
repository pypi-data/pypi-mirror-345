{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the processing units.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for more resources.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, actively producing iron plates from iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore to the furnaces.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) with warnings about blocked drop position, indicating a need to clear the output area.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target chest contains the items you intend to extract. The agent attempted to extract iron plates from a wooden chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) which did not contain any, resulting in an error.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Verify that the inventory contains the items you intend to insert. The agent attempted to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory, causing an error.\n\n### Inserter Warnings\n- Address warnings from inserters indicating they are waiting for source items or that the drop position is blocked. Ensure that the supply chain is continuous and that there is space for items to be dropped.\n\n### Resource Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt production processes."}
