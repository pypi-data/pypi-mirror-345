{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -86.0) and (43.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -86.0) with fuel (10 coal), mining coal.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (43.0, -86.0) with fuel (7 coal), mining coal.\n- **Transport Belt System** connecting both drills:\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (44.5, -84.5) to (42.5, -84.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Outputs at (42.5, -84.5) to (42.5, -82.5), direction DOWN.\n  - Inventory contains 12 coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5) with fuel (8 coal), transferring coal from the belt to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -82.5) storing 382 coal.\n\n#### Wooden Chest at Position (41.5, -79.5)\n- Empty wooden chest for storage.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** with fuel (12 coal), currently idle due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure you are within 10 tiles of the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the desired location before placing.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Always check if the target tile is free before placing an entity. Use the `can_place_entity` API to verify tile availability.\n\n#### Errors when refueling or interacting with entities\n- Ensure you are close enough to the entity before attempting to interact with it (e.g., refueling, extracting items). Move to the entity's position first.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts or inserters\n- Verify that the input and output positions of belts and inserters are correctly aligned and free of obstructions before connecting them."}
