{"content": "I see the core issue now - we need a crafting machine to make transport belts and iron gear wheels. Let's analyze what we learned:\n\n1. Key Insights:\n- We can't craft items directly that require a crafting machine\n- We need to use an assembling machine or similar for crafting transport belts\n- The recipe requires iron plates and iron gear wheels\n\n2. Current Inventory:\n```python\n{\n    'iron-chest': 1,\n    'transport-belt': 11,\n    'coal': 15,\n    'stone': 60,\n    'iron-ore': 20,\n    'iron-plate': 63,\n    'iron-gear-wheel': 2\n}\n```\n\n3. Alternative Approach Needed:\nInstead of trying to craft more transport belts, we should:\n- Work with the 11 transport belts we have\n- Move the furnace closer to minimize belt usage\n- Create a smaller, more efficient setup\n\nLet's try this alternative approach:\n\n```python\n# First, pick up the distant furnace\nmove_to(Position(x=-13.0, y=32.0))\npickup_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Position(x=-13.0, y=32.0))\nprint(\"Picked up distant furnace\")\n\n# Move closer to chest and place furnace\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.5, y=21.5))\nchest = get_entity(Prototype.IronChest, Position(x=-15.5, y=21.5))\n\nif chest:\n    # Place furnace closer to chest\n    furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n        Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n        reference_position=chest.position,\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n        spacing=3  # Increased spacing to avoid conflicts\n    )\n    \n    if furnace:\n        print(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n        \n        # Use our limited transport belts to connect chest to furnace\n        belts = connect_entities(\n            chest.position,\n            furnace.position,\n            Prototype.TransportBelt\n        )\n        print(\"Connected chest to furnace with belts\")\n        \n        # Add inserter for the furnace\n        inserter = place_entity_next_to(\n            Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n            reference_position=furnace.position,\n            direction=Direction.LEFT,\n            spacing=1\n        )\n        \n        if inserter:\n            print(f\"Added inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n            rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.RIGHT)\n            print(\"Fueled and rotated inserter\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Current entities: {entities}\")\n```\n\nTips for Future:\n1. Always check if crafting requires a machine first\n2. Work with available resources rather than trying to craft when machines are needed\n3. Minimize distances between entities to reduce transport belt usage\n4. Use spacing parameter to avoid entity conflicts\n5.
