{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (Position x=1-3, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (1,1) and (3,1)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (1.5,2.5) and (3.5,2.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing iron plates at positions (1.5,3.5) and (3.5,3.5)\n\n### Additional Storage (Position x=5.5, y=2.5-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- One wooden chest at position (5.5,3.5)\n- One burner inserter at position (5.5,2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (Position x=2-4.5, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (2,7) and (4,7)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (2.5,8.5) and (4.5,8.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing copper plates at positions (2.5,9.5) and (4.5,9.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=2.5-13.5, y=33.5-37.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (2.5,35.5)\n- Boiler at position (7,35.5)\n- Steam engine at position (13.5,35.5)\n- Two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes connecting offshore pump to boiler\n  - Steam pipes connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Electric pole network connecting various parts of the factory\n\n### Disconnected Offshore Pump (Position x=-5.5, y=26.5)\nA standalone offshore pump that is not connected to any system\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Technology Research Errors\n- Research prerequisites need to be met before crafting advanced items\n- Automation technology must be researched before crafting Assembling Machine 1\n\n### Complex Recipe Chain Errors\n- When crafting items with complex requirements (like Lab), ensure you have:\n  - All required intermediate products (electronic circuits, copper cables)\n  - Appropriate production facilities for items that can't be hand-crafted (copper plates need furnaces)\n  - Sufficient raw materials for all components in the recipe chain\n\n### Production Facility Status Issues\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n  - Ensure proper supply of raw materials to furnaces\n- Boiler shows \"out of fuel\" warning\n  - Remember to supply fuel (coal) to keep power generation running"}
