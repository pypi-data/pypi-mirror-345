{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (17.5, 20.5) with warnings: 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 23.0) with status: 'out of fuel'.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status: 'working'.\n- Pipe connections between the boiler and steam engine, including a PipeGroup at position (3.5, 17.5) and another PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 23.5) for water transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler at (1.5, 23.0) and the steam engine at (17.5, 20.5). Check for any misalignment or missing connections in the pipeline.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the boiler to maintain its operation. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to avoid interruptions in energy production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities`: Used to connect entities such as pipes and underground pipes. Failed due to incorrect connection setup between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: List of pipe entities intended for connection between the boiler and steam engine."}
