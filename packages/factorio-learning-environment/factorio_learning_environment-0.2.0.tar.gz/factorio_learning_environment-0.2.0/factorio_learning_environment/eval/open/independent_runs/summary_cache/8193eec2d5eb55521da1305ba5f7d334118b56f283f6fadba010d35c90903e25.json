{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Collection and Transfer System at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) for extracting coal, currently out of fuel and blocked by an item on the ground.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) for transferring coal from the drill to a Wooden Chest, fueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest intended to collect coal, but placement issues have been encountered.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates, currently full with iron plates and fueled with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place new entities like Wooden Chests or Burner Inserters.\n\n### Errors with entity alignment and positioning\n- When repositioning entities like inserters, ensure they are aligned with the source and destination entities to avoid misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with type conversion in code\n- Ensure that all variables used in type conversions are of the correct type, such as converting dimensions to integers when necessary.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills or other production entities to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors with insufficient fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills to maintain continuous operation."}
