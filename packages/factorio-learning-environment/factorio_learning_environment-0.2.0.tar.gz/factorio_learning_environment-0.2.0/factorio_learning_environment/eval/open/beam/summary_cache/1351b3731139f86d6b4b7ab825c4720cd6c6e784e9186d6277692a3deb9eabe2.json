However, I still need **12 more iron plates** to reach the target of crafting 18 iron gear wheels.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Continue waiting for the remaining iron ore in the furnace to be smelted** into additional iron plates.\n2. **Extract the produced iron plates from the furnace once the smelting is complete**.\n3. **Monitor the inventory after extraction** to see how many iron plates I have accumulated.\n\nLet's continue monitoring the furnace for further production by waiting a little longer.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Sleep for a brief period to allow more smelting to progress\nsleep(5)  # Wait for another 5 seconds for the smelting process to progress\nprint(\"Waiting for more iron plates to be produced...\")\n\n# Check the status of the furnace again after the wait\nprint(f\"Furnace Status after waiting: {inspect_inventory(new_stone_furnace)}\")  # Check the state of the furnace after some time\nprint(f\"Current Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory status after waiting", "summary_range": "[1-146]"}
