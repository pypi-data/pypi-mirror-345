{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a fuel inventory of coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring resources between entities.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution System\nThis system stores and distributes iron plates, consisting of:\n- **Multiple Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) with varying quantities of iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5), (-11.5, -46.5), and (-8.5, -47.5) facilitating the movement of iron plates between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting Iron Plates\n- Ensure that the extraction function is correctly targeted at the furnace and that the furnace contains the required quantity of iron plates before attempting extraction.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and configured to access the source entity.\n\n### Furnace Belt Blockage\n- Check that the destination for items being transferred by inserters is not blocked. Ensure there is sufficient space in the destination inventory to accommodate incoming items.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Regularly check and ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to continue smelting operations. Refill furnaces with iron ore as needed to maintain continuous operation."}
