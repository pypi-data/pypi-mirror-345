{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the mining drill to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) for smelting copper ore, although currently not receiving copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring iron ore to another Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) with iron plate production.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring coal to another Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Multiple Belt Groups connecting various entities, facilitating the movement of resources across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain to ensure resources are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- When connecting entities, ensure that the correct attributes and methods are being used. For example, avoid using non-existent attributes like 'outputs' on objects that do not support them, such as 'Chest'.\n\n### Errors in Resource Supply\n- Verify that all transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to ensure resources reach their intended destinations without interruption.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. Check that the source entities are supplying the necessary items and that the inserters are correctly positioned to pick them up."}
