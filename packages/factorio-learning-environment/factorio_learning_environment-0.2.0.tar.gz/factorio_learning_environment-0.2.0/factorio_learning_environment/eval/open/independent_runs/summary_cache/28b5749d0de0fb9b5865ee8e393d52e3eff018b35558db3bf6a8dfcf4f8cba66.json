{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), responsible for extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), used to store extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\n- Multiple instances of refueling activities for inserters and mining drills with coal, ensuring continuous operation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with their pickup and drop positions to facilitate the transfer of items. Reposition and align inserters if necessary.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure that it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's input.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Before attempting to insert items, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid operation failures."}
