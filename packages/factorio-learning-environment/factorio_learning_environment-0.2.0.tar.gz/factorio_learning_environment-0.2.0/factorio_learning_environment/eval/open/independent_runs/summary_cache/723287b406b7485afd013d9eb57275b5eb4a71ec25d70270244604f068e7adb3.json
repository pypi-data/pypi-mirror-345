{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - This drill is responsible for mining iron ore and is currently fueled with coal.\n  - It is connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) and another chest at position (-15.5, -48.5) for ore storage.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5)\n  - The chest at (-14.5, -48.5) contains iron ore and iron plates.\n  - The chest at (-15.5, -48.5) is used for additional storage capacity.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - This furnace is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - It is currently fueled with coal but has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5)\n  - This inserter transfers items between the chests and is fueled with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., wooden chest) contains the items you intend to extract. Verify the contents before attempting extraction to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is unoccupied. If an entity already exists at the intended position, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of storage entities to prevent them from becoming full. This will ensure continuous operation of mining drills and inserters.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- When repositioning inserters, make sure they are correctly aligned to transfer items between the intended source and destination entities. Proper alignment is crucial for efficient item transfer."}
