{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) for coal collection\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) for iron ore collection\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Complex at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0)\n- Primary wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n- Secondary wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5)\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) for copper plates\n- Chain of inserters:\n  - Burner inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving items from primary to secondary chest\n  - Burner inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving items to furnace\n  - Burner inserter at (23.5, 21.5) moving items from chest to furnace\n  - Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving finished plates to output chest\n\n### Unused Smelting Setup\nTwo unused stone furnaces at:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connections\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests\n- Use inserters to move items from chests onto belts\n\n### Errors with Furnace Management\n- Check furnace fuel capacity before attempting to insert more fuel\n- Current issue: Attempting to insert coal into a furnace that already has maximum fuel (50/50)\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple inserters are waiting for source items - ensure proper item flow through the production chain\n- One inserter has blocked output - ensure there is a valid destination entity for items being moved\n\n### Resource Management\n- Iron mining drill is out of fuel - implement regular fuel checking and refueling system\n- Some furnaces have no ingredients to smelt - ensure proper supply chain of raw materials"}
