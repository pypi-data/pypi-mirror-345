Check the connections and ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected to the steam engine.\n\n#### Errors Related to Boiler Fuel\n- Make sure the boiler has the necessary fuel to operate. Regularly check the fuel inventory and refill as needed to maintain operation.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the current steps.\n- **Important Variables**: None explicitly assigned in the current steps."}
