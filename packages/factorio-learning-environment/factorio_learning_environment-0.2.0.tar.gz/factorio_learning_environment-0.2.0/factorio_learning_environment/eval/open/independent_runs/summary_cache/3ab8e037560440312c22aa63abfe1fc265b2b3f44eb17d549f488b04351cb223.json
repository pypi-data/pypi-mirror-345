{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n  \n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Cannot Place Burner Inserter**: Ensure there is enough space and the correct orientation before placing a burner inserter.\n- **Cannot Place Wooden Chest**: Verify that the intended location is not occupied by another entity or item before placing a wooden chest.\n- **Cannot Place Transport Belt**: Confirm that the desired location is free of obstructions and that the belt can be placed without overlapping other entities.\n\n### Errors with Entity Retrieval\n- **Could Not Get Prototype.StoneFurnace**: Double-check the position coordinates and ensure that the stone furnace exists at the specified location before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors Related to Output Blockage\n- **Output Blocked by Item on the Ground**: Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Clearing Items from Drill's Drop Position**: Regularly clear items from the drop position of the drill to maintain continuous operation.\n- **Refueling**: Keep track of fuel levels in machines like the burner mining drill to ensure they remain operational."}
