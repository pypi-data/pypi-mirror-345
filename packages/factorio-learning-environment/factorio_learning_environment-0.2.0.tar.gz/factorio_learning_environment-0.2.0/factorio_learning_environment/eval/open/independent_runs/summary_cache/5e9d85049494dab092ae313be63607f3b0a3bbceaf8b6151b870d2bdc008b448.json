{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a connected Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring materials to a Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5).\n- Two Stone Furnaces located at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0) respectively, both fueled and actively converting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a connected Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring coal to a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (42.5, -83.5), and (46.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs spanning from (42.5, -83.5) to (45.5, -83.5), facilitating coal transportation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter has items available to be picked up. Check the inventory of the source entity and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly monitor the fuel levels of all entities that require fuel, such as burner mining drills and furnaces, to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of the inventory levels in chests and furnaces to ensure efficient resource flow and prevent bottlenecks in production.\n\n### Placement and Connectivity\n- Verify the correct placement and connectivity of entities, such as inserters and belts, to ensure they are functioning as intended and materials are being transferred seamlessly."}
