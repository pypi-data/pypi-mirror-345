{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Smelting Area at (0,0)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) processing iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0) processing iron ore\n\n###Copper Smelting Area at (4,4)  \nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0) processing copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0) processing copper ore\n\n###Power Generation System\nComponents:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Connected pipe network carrying water (fluid system 5937) and steam (fluid system 5938)\n- Electric pole network distributing power across the map (multiple poles from x=6.5,y=24.5 to x=8.5,y=18.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with research technology\n- Check if a technology is already researched before attempting to research it again\n- Use get_research_state() to verify current research status\n\n### Errors with crafting complex items\n- When crafting items with multiple ingredients and sub-components (like logistic science packs), ensure you have all required base materials first\n- Break down complex crafting into smaller steps to avoid recursive crafting loops\n- Pre-craft intermediate products before attempting to craft the final item\n\n### Errors with furnace operations\n- Always verify inventory has required materials before attempting to insert into furnaces\n- Keep track of ore quantities and harvest more resources before furnaces run empty"}
