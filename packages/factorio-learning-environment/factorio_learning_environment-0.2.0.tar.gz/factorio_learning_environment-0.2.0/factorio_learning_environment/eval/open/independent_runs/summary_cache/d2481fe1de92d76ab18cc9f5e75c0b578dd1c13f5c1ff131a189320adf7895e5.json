{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, with key positions at (20.5, -10.5), (21.5, -10.5), (22.5, -10.5), and others\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (24.5, -6.5), (24.5, -7.5), and others, providing electrical connections\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for resource collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Iron Ore Collection and Storage\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for iron ore collection\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5) for storing extracted iron ore\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) for producing copper cables\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) for moving items into the Assembling Machine\n- Belt group connecting the furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Additional Storage and Transport\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 2.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) for transferring items between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path and source items to pick up. The inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) is waiting for source items. Verify that the source has items available for transfer.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources in Assemblers\n- The Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) cannot create copper cables due to missing copper plates. Ensure that the required resources are available in the input slots of assemblers to avoid production halts.\n\n### Warnings of No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- The furnaces at Positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), and (5.0, 5.0) are showing warnings of no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that raw materials are supplied to these furnaces to maintain continuous production.\n\nThese tips should help in addressing the current issues and improving the efficiency of the setup."}
