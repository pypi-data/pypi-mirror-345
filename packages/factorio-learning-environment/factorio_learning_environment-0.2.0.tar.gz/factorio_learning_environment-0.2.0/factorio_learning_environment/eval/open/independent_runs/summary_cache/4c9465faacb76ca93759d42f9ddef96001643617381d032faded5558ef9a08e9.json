{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 104-111)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-18.5, 69.5)\n(Still partially operational with persistent connection issues)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-18.5 y=69.5) - working but water connection incomplete\n- Boiler (position x=-4.5 y=50.0) - now with 6 coal units, status FULL_OUTPUT\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=50.5) - still not connected to power network\n- Pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes (positions: x=-18.5,y=67.5; x=-18.5,y=68.5) - connected to pump\n  - Steam pipes (positions: x=-6.5,y=50.5; x=-2.5,y=50.5) - boiler output connected\n- Power pole networks:\n  - Main grid (positions: x=0.5,y=53.5) - inactive\n  - Isolated pole at x=-50.5 y=18.5\n\n### New Power Plant at (0,0)\n(New construction attempt)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5 y=-2.5) - working\n- Boiler (position x=0.5 y=2.0) - out of fuel\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=7.5) - not connected\n- Pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes (positions: x=-8.5,y=-2.5; x=-8.5,y=-1.5)\n  - Steam pipes (positions: x=0.5,y=0.5; x=1.5,y=0.5)\n\n### Stone Mining and Smelting Operation at position (-49.5, 10.5)\n(Unchanged from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5 y=10.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0 y=11.0)\n- Input inserter (position x=-47.5 y=10.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-44.5 y=11.5)\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=12.5)\n\n### Mining Operation at position (-52.5, 16.5)\n(Still operational but isolated)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-52.5 y=16.5) - receiving stone but no power\n- Stone furnace (position x=-50.0 y=16.0) - working with coal (18 remaining)\n- Power pole (position x=-50.5 y=18.5) - still isolated\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical Pipe Connection Issues\n- Repeated pipe placement failures at (-3.5,50.5), (-0.5,51.5)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement complete obstruction clearing before placement\n    2. Add visual debugging for pipe paths\n    3. Create systematic pipe placement algorithm\n\n### Entity Placement Range Errors\n- Attempting placements while too far away (distance 50.62 vs max 10)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Always verify distance to target before placement\n    2. Implement automatic movement to placement range\n    3. Add range validation checks\n\n### Water Edge Placement Failures\n- Boiler placement attempts overlapping water\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Verify land-only placement for non-water entities\n    2. Implement water edge detection\n    3. Add minimum distance from water checks\n\n### Inventory Management Issues\n- Attempting to place offshore pumps when none in inventory\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement inventory checks before placement attempts\n    2. Add automatic crafting for missing items\n    3. Create resource tracking system\n\n### Power System Validation\n- Steam engine still not receiving steam\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Verify complete fluid path from boiler to engine\n    2. Check all connection points are properly aligned\n    3. Implement system-wide validation checks\n\n### Construction Process Optimization\n- Repeated rebuild attempts without success\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement phased construction:\n       - Clearance verification\n       - Path planning\n       - Placement validation\n    2. Add rollback capability for failed builds\n\n### Position Validation\n- Multiple placement attempts at same failing positions\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement position validation before placement\n    2. Add automatic position adjustment\n    3. Create fallback placement strategies"}
