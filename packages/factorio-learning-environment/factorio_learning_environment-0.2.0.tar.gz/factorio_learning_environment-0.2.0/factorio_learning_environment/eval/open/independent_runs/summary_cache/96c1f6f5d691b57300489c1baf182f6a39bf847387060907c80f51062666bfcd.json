{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(x=117.5, y=-30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position x=117.5, y=-30.5), boiler(position x=111.5, y=-32.0), and offshore pump(position x=107.5, y=-33.5) connected by pipes.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=60.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of a furnace(position x=60.0, y=-60.0) and burner inserters(position x=60.5, y=-61.5 and x=61.5, y=-61.5) connected to a wooden chest(position x=62.5, y=-61.5).\n\n### Pipe network at position(x=107.5, y=-34.5)\nConsists of pipes connecting the offshore pump(position x=107.5, y=-33.5) to the boiler(position x=111.5, y=-32.0) and further to the steam engine(position x=117.5, y=-30.5).\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when connecting pipes: Ensure that the connection points of the entities are not occupied by other entities and that the pipe can be placed at the desired position.\n* Errors when using burner inserters: Make sure that the inserter has enough fuel to operate and that the pickup and drop positions are valid.\n* Errors when placing entities: Ensure that the tile is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* Utility functions:\n\t+ connect_entities: connects two entities with a pipe. Failure modes: connection points are occupied, pipe cannot be placed at the desired position. Success modes: entities are connected successfully.\n\t+ place_entity: places an entity at a specified position. Failure modes: tile is occupied, entity cannot be placed at the desired position. Success modes: entity is placed successfully.\n* Important variables:\n\t+ offshore_pump: OffshorePump entity\n\t+ boiler: Boiler entity\n\t+ steam_engine: Generator entity\n\t+ pipe: Pipe entity\n\t+ furnace: Furnace entity\n\t+ inserter: BurnerInserter entity\n\t+ chest: Chest entity\n\t+ position: Position object representing the coordinates of an entity\n\t+ connection_points: list of Position objects representing the connection points of an entity"}
