Multiple attempts at positions (0.5, 19.5), (0.5, 18.5), (0.5, 19.0), (-0.5, 19.5), and (1.5, 17.0) failed due to existing objects.\n  \u2022 Verify that a wooden chest is available in the inventory before attempting placement to avoid \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d errors.\n\n- Variable Initialization:\n  \u2022 Ensure that key variables (for example, input_chest and inserter) are defined and initialized before being referenced. Repeated NameError issues indicate that these variables were used prior to assignment.\n\n- Inserter Placement and Orientation:\n  \u2022 Adjust spacing, direction, and reference positions when positioning burner inserters next to input chests. Errors occurred when attempting to place inserters adjacent to the input chest at (1.5, 17.5) due to collision with nearby entities (such as AssemblingMachine1) or unsuitable terrain.\n  \u2022 When modifying inserter orientation (e.g., switching from facing LEFT to DOWN), verify that the updated placement still avoids conflicts with surrounding structures.\n\n- Resource Insertion:\n  \u2022 Check for sufficient resource availability in the inventory (e.g., copper-plate count) before attempting to insert items into chests, as failures were reported when resources were lacking."}
