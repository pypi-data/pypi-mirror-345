{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and actively mining coal resources.\n  - Drop position for mined resources is at (x=42.5, y=-81.5).\n  - Currently has a warning: \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Currently has no ingredients to smelt, but has produced 81 iron plates.\n  - Status indicates a lack of ingredients for smelting.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest at the intended position**: Ensure that the intended position for placing a wooden chest is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n- **Cannot place Burner Inserter at the intended position**: Verify that the intended position for placing a burner inserter is clear and that there is enough space for placement.\n\n### Errors related to resource management\n- **Stone Furnace has no ingredients to smelt**: Regularly check the furnace's inventory to ensure it has the necessary ingredients for smelting. Consider setting up automated systems to supply the furnace with raw materials.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- **Burner Mining Drill output blocked**: Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output of the mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors in code execution\n- **Error in creating a Wooden Chest**: Ensure that the data types used in the code are correct as per the specifications.
