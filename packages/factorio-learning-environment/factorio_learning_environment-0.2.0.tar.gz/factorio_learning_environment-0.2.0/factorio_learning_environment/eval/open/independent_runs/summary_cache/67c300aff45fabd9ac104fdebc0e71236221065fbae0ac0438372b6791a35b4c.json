For example, the agent tried to insert iron ore into a furnace without having any iron ore in its inventory.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from blocked transport belts\n- Clear the transport belts at the drop positions of mining drills to allow them to continue mining. For example, the mining drills at (x=42.0, y=-83.0) and (x=45.0, y=-83.0) are blocked due to full transport belts.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from empty transport belts\n- Ensure the transport belt contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it. For example, the agent tried to extract coal from a transport belt that did not contain any coal.\n\n#### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure the entity you are refueling has"}
