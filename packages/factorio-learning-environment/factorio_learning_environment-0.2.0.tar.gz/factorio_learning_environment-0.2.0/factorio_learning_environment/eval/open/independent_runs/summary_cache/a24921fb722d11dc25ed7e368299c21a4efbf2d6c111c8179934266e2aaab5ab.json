{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) which is operational and fueled with coal. It is currently facing an issue with output blockage due to lack of a sink entity.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) which is fueled but lacks ingredients to smelt. It is connected to the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the desired location for placing entities like Transport Belts, Wooden Chests, and Burner Inserters is unoccupied and valid before attempting to place them. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied or invalid locations\n- Verify that the target location for moving entities such as Stone Furnaces is unoccupied and valid to avoid movement errors.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities at specified positions\n- Double-check the presence and type of entities at specified positions before attempting to interact with them. This will help avoid errors related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or appropriate infrastructure to accept outputs from entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage and maintain operational efficiency."}
