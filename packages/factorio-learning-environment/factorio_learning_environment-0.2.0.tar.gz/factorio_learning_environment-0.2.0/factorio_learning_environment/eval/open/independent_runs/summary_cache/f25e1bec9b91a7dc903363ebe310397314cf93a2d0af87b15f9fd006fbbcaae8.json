Drop unnecessary items or use storage containers to free up space.  \n\n- **Inefficient item dropping**:  \n  - The agent dropped items multiple times without successfully freeing up inventory space, as the inventory remained full.  \n  - **Tip**: Verify the inventory state after dropping items to ensure space is actually freed. Use a systematic approach to manage inventory, such as prioritizing essential items.  \n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions or important variables were defined or invoked in the latest steps."}
