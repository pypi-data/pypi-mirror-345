{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, refueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to another chest.\n  - At position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), waiting for space to transfer items.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - At position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), producing iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), producing iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), storing iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), storing iron ore.\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), storing iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space\n- Ensure that the destination of an inserter has enough space to receive items. Consider using additional storage or managing existing storage to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Lack of Inventory\n- Before attempting to place an entity, verify that the required item is available in the inventory. Plan inventory management to ensure necessary items are always in stock.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source of an inserter has items available for transfer. Regularly check and refuel or restock sources to maintain continuous operation."}
