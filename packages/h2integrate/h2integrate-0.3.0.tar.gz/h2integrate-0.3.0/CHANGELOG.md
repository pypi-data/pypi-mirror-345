# CHANGELOG

## 0.3.0 [May 2 2025]

- Introduced a fully new underlying framework for H2Integrate which uses [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org/), allowing for more flexibility and extensibility in the future
- Expanded introductory documentation

## 0.2.1, Unreleased, TBD

- Fixed iron data save issue [PR 122](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/122)
- Added optional inputs to electrolyzer model, including curve coefficients and water usage rate.
- Bug-fix in electrolyzer outputs (H2_Results) if some stacks are never turned on.

## 0.2 [7 April 2025]

- Allow users to save the H2IntegrateOutput class as a yaml file and read that yaml to an instance of the output class
- Include new plotting capabilities: (1) hydrogen storage, production, and dispatch; (2) electricity and hydrogen dispatch
- Remove reference_plants from examples. Reference plants can now be found in the [ReferenceHybridSystemDesigns](https://github.com/NREL/ReferenceHybridSystemDesigns) repository.
- Use sentence capitalization for plot labels and legends
- Use "metric ton" instead of "tonne" or "metric tonne" in all internal naming and plots
- Fix bug in hydrogen dispatch plotting by storing time series of hydrogen demand by hour
- Update the PEM efficiency to 51.0 kWh/kg from 54.6 kWh/kg
- Bumped PySAM version to 6+ and HOPP to 3.2.0
- Removed defunct conda build and upload scripts
- Return full solution dictionary from ProFAST, allowing access to CRF and WACC
- Renamed code from GreenHEART to H2Integrate
- Added iron processing framework and capabilities [PR 90](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/90)
- Added Martin and Rosner iron ore models, performance and cost for each [PR 90](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/90)
- Added Rosner direct reduction iron (DRI) model, performance and cost [PR 90](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/90)
- Added Martin transport module for performance and cost of iron [PR 90](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/90)
- Added generalized Stinn cost model for electrolysis of arbitrary materials [PR 90](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/90)

## v0.1.4 [4 February 2025]

- Adds `CoolProp` to `pyproject.toml`
- Changes units of `lcoe_real` in `HOPPComponent` from "MW*h" to "kW*h"
- Adds `pre-commit`, `ruff`, and `isort` checks, and CI workflow to ensure these steps aren't
  skipped.
- Updates steel cost year to 2022
- Updates ammonia cost year to 2022
- Requires HOPP 3.1.1 or higher
- Updates tests to be compatible with HOPP 3.1.1 with ProFAST integration
- Removes support for python 3.9
- Add steel feedstock transport costs (lime, carbon, and iron ore pellets)
- Allow individual debt rate, equity rate, and debt/equity ratio/split for each subsystem
- Add initial docs focused on new H2Integrate development
- New documentation CI pipeline to publish documentation at nrel.github.io/H2Integrate/ and test
  that the documentation site will build on each pull request.
