{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) intended to store iron ore, but currently empty.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest, but waiting for source items.\n\n### Coal-Powered Furnace Setup at Position (62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0) with coal fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (63.5, -52.5) waiting for source items, intended to supply the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (61.5, -54.5) waiting for source items, intended to supply the furnace.\n\n### Additional Inserter and Chest Setup\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -50.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -49.5) currently empty, intended to receive items from the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Transport Belts\n- Ensure you have the required sub-ingredients, such as iron plates, before attempting to craft transport belts. Iron plates need to be smelted in a furnace or crafted using a machine.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the inserters have a continuous supply of source items to avoid them waiting idly. Ensure that the mining drill is producing and transferring items correctly to the intended destination.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary raw materials to process. Ensure that the transport and inserter systems are correctly set up to deliver resources to the furnace.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to maintain their operation. Ensure that coal or another fuel source is consistently supplied to all inserters."}
