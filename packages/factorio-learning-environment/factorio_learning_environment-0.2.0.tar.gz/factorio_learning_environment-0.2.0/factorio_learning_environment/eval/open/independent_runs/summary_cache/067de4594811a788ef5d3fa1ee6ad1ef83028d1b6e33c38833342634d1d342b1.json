{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring materials to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring materials to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace or any other entity. This will prevent errors related to missing items.\n\n### Warnings for Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to avoid warnings about full chests, which can halt mining operations.\n\n### Warnings for Furnaces\n- Monitor furnace warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" to ensure continuous production. Ensure that the necessary raw materials are available for smelting processes."}
