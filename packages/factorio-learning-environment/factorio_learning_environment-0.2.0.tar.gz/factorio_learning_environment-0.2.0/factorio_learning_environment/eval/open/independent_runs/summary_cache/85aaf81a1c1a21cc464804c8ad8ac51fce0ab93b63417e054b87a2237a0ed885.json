Verify that there are no missing or misaligned pipe segments.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Make sure the steam engine is properly connected to the power network with electric poles and that there is a continuous connection from the steam engine to the power-consuming entities.\n\n### Errors with No Input Liquid in Steam Engine\n- Confirm that the steam engine is receiving steam from the boiler. Check the pipe connections and ensure that steam is being generated and transported correctly.\n\n### Errors with Full Chest Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty the chests at the mining drill's drop positions to prevent mining interruptions. Consider using inserters and belts to automate the transfer of items from full chests."}
