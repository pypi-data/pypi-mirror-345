{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is used for mining iron ore. It is currently fueled with coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which is used for storing coal and other resources.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting fuel into the furnace with no ingredients to smelt**\n  - Ensure that you have the necessary ingredients in your inventory before inserting fuel into the furnace.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace result is full**\n  - Regularly check the output inventory of the furnace and extract items to prevent it from becoming full.\n\n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**\n  - Empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to continue mining with the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Type-Annotated Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `furnace_source`: Inventory\n  - `furnace_result`: Inventory\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: BurnerMiningDrill\n  - `wooden-chest`: Chest"}
