{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, 72.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 72.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 75.5)\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 79.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric poles distributing power\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at (18.5, 73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position (18.5, 73.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 75.5) collecting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 75.5) moving ore from chest to belt\n- Transport belt system from position (20.5, 75.5) to (26.5, 76.5)\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (22.0, 79.0) and (26.0, 79.0)\n- Input inserters at positions (22.5, 77.5) and (26.5, 77.5)\n- Output inserters at positions (22.5, 80.5) and (26.5, 80.5)\n- Output belt system from position (22.5, 81.5) to (26.5, 81.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (28.5, 81.5) collecting iron plates\n- Inserter at position (27.5, 81.5) moving plates to the collection chest\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a chest as a source; use an inserter between the chest and belt\n- Ensure the path is valid when connecting transport belts; belts must form a continuous line\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing an entity\n- Remove existing entities before placing new ones at the same position\n\n### Errors related to player position\n- Move closer to the target location before placing entities; maximum placement distance is 10 units\n- Use move_to() function to navigate to the desired location before placing entities\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Ensure the drop position of an inserter is not already occupied by another entity\n- When placing an inserter next to an entity, check that the target position is free\n\n### Function name errors\n- Use move_to() instead of move() for player movement\n- Double-check function names to ensure they match the available API"}
