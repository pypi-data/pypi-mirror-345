{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex (around x=-8, y=-59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Three wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\nEach drill is working and has coal fuel, outputting to respective chests\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (around x=3, y=0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Four input inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Four output inserters at positions (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- Four input wooden chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5) containing coal\n- Four output wooden chests at positions (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (around x=-27, y=-60)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (-25.5, -59.5) and (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-24.5, -58.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing inserters next to entities, ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing structures\n- Check if the target position is valid (not water or other blocking terrain)\n- Consider increasing spacing between entities if placement fails\n\n### Entity Output Blocking\n- Ensure there is a proper output destination (like a chest or belt) for entities that produce items\n- Place appropriate item collection systems before starting production to prevent output blocking\n\n### Resource Management\n- Make sure entities have sufficient fuel (coal) to operate continuously\n- Monitor furnace ingredient levels to maintain continuous production"}
