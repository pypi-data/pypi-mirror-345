{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (9 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (50 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chest\n- Ensure the desired location for placing the Wooden Chest is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Check for any obstructions or existing entities on the target tile before attempting to place the chest.\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Verify that the target location for the Burner Inserter is clear and that it aligns correctly with the intended input and output entities. Ensure there are no obstructions or misalignments that could prevent successful placement.\n\n### Errors when placing Transport Belt\n- Confirm that the intended path for the Transport Belt is clear of obstacles and that there is a continuous path for the belt to connect the desired entities. Check for any misalignments or blocked tiles that could hinder belt placement.\n\n### Furnace Production Issues\n- Regularly check the furnace setup to ensure it is correctly configured for continuous production. Verify that the furnace has sufficient fuel and input resources, and that there are no blockages preventing output."}
