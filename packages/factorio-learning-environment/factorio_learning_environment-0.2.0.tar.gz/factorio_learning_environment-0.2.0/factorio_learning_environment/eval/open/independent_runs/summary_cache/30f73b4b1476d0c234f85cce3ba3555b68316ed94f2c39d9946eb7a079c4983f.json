Raw resources like coal must be gathered from the environment and cannot be crafted.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Fueling Issues\n- Regularly check and ensure that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of resources.\n- Ensure that inserters are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation. Refuel them with coal or other suitable fuel sources when necessary.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer resources into the furnace. Misalignment or lack of fuel can lead to the furnace not receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting.\n\n### Chest Overflow Management\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent overflow. Regularly extract items from chests to free up space and maintain the efficiency of the mining setup."}
