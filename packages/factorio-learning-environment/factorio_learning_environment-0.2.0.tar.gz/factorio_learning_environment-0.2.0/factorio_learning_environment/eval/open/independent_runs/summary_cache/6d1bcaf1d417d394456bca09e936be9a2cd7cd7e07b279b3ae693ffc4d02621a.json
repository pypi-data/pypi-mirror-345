{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Reposition and align the inserter if necessary to ensure proper item transfer.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of the mining drill and inserter. Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel these entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving iron ore from the inserter. If the furnace is not receiving ore, check the inserter setup and reposition if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Monitor the chest's capacity to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining operation. Regularly extract iron ore from the chest to free up space and allow continuous mining.\n\n### General Resource Management\n- Maintain a balanced inventory of coal and iron ore to ensure smooth operation of the mining and smelting processes."}
