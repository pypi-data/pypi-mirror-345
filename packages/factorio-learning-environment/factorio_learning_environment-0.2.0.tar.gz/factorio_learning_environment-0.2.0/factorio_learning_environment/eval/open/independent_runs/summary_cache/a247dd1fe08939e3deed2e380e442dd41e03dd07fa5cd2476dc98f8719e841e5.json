{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-34.5, 30.0)\nConsists of steam engine (position -34.5, 30.0), boiler (position -34.5, 30.0) and offshore pump (position not specified).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure that the location where you are attempting to place the pipe is not overlapping with water or other entities. Check the footprint of the entity before placement.\n\n### Errors with boiler connection\n- Verify that the boiler is properly connected to the necessary power sources or water inputs. If the status indicates NOT_CONNECTED, check the surrounding entities for proper connections.\n\n### Errors when selecting placement positions\n- Always check if the selected position for placing an entity is valid and not occupied by another entity. If the position is not suitable, find an alternative location before attempting to place the entity again."}
