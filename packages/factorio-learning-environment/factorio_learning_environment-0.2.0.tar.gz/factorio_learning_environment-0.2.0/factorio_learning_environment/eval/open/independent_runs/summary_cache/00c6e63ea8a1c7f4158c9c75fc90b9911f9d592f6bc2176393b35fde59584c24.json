{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at Position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -86.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (43.0, -86.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (43.5, -84.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -82.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5)\n- Transport belt at position (41.5, -84.5)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at Position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-17.0, -52.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (-16.5, -50.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (-17.5, -50.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -51.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (-14.5, -52.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (-11.5, -50.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a chest with insufficient quantity\n- Ensure the chest contains the required quantity of items before attempting to extract them. Check the inventory of the chest to confirm the item count.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Use the `can_place_entity` function to check tile availability.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are out of fuel\n- Ensure mining drills are fueled with coal or other appropriate fuel sources to maintain operation. Regularly check and refuel mining drills to avoid interruptions.\n\n#### Errors when chests at drop positions are full\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue operation. Use inserters or manually transfer items to other storage solutions.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials for smelting. Use inserters to automate the transfer of items into furnaces."}
