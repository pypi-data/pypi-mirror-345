{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for ore storage.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore to:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) managing the transfer of materials between chests and furnaces.\n- **Additional Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) currently not in use due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-49.5), (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-5.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-4.5, y=-48.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-7.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-3.5, y=-48.5) with varying quantities of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of source items to prevent them from waiting. Regularly check and refuel the connected entities to maintain a steady flow of materials.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure the destination for inserters is not blocked. Regularly clear or manage the output to ensure there is space for inserters to place items.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Always check your inventory for the necessary fuel items before attempting to refuel entities. Harvest or acquire the required fuel in advance to avoid interruptions in operation.\n\n### Realignment of Inserters\n- Regularly check the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned for optimal operation. Misaligned inserters may lead to inefficiencies or stoppages in production."}
