{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10.0, -59.0)\nThree burner mining drills in a row mining iron ore, connected to wooden chests:\n- Mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0) dropping to chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0) dropping to chest at (-7.5, -57.5)  \n- Mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0) dropping to chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are fueled and operational, though the last chest is full.\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0.0, 0.0)\nFour furnace pairs arranged in a line:\n- Furnaces at (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0) with input inserters and chests\n- Furnaces at (4.0, 0.0) and (6.0, 0.0) with input inserters and chests\n- Output inserters for each furnace pair dropping to chests at y=2.5\nAll furnaces are fueled but waiting for ingredients.\n\n### Mining and Smelting System at (-28.0, -61.0)\nMining drill and furnace setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) (currently out of fuel)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0) connected to chest at (-24.5, -58.5)\n- Additional furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Output chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n\n### Belt Transport System\nMultiple belt groups connecting different sections:\n- Belt line from (-4.5, -57.5) to (-4.5, -59.5)\n- Belt line from (-9.5, -54.5) to (-7.5, -54.5)\n- Belt line from (-6.5, -54.5) to (-4.5, -54.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- Ensure proper entity-to-entity connections when creating belt systems\n\n### Resource management errors\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available before attempting to insert fuel\n- Monitor chest capacities - full chests are blocking mining operations at (-5.5, -57.5)\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Some inserters have blocked outputs due to missing destination entities\n- Ensure complete input/output chains when setting up production lines"}
