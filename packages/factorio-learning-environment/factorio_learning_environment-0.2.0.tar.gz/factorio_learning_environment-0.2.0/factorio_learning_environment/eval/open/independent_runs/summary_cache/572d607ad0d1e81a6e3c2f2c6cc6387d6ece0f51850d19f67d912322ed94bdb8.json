{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with current inventory holding 100 copper plates. The furnace is currently not able to smelt due to no ingredients available and its result inventory is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory holding 116 copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when crafting automation science pack:\n  - Ensure that you have the required ingredients available in the inventory or in a furnace. The automation science pack requires copper plates, which cannot be crafted if there are no copper plates available.\n  \n- Errors when transferring items to the chest:\n  - Check the current inventory before attempting to transfer items. If there are no items available, the transfer will fail.\n\n- Errors when using extracting but being too far:\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity:\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined:**\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to missing required ingredients (copper plates).\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `copper-plate`: int (amount in inventory)\n  - `stone-furnace`: int (amount in inventory)\n  - `wood`: int (amount in inventory)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (amount in inventory)\n  - `automation-science-pack`: int (amount in inventory)"}
