{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-77.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-73.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=6.5, y=-59.5) for transferring iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=7.5, y=-61.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-47.5, y=-123.5) connected to a series of PipeGroups for water distribution.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles forming an electricity network with poles at various positions, providing power to connected entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing steam engines\n- Ensure there is enough space and a suitable location for placing steam engines. Consider adjusting the BuildingBox size or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes.\n\n### Errors when connecting to the power network\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are connected to a power source and that the power network is operational to avoid entities not receiving electricity."}
