{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (17.0, 72.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (17.0, 72.0) and a Stone Furnace at position (17.0, 74.0)\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (20.0, 73.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, 73.0) and a Stone Furnace at position (20.0, 75.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Extraction Structure at position (17.0, 74.0)\nConsists of a Burner Inserter at position (17.5, 76.5) that extracts iron plates from the Stone Furnace at position (17.0, 74.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when connecting transport belts directly to a furnace:\n  - Transport belts cannot be connected directly to a Prototype.StoneFurnace object as a target. \n  - You need to add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.StoneFurnace and use the inserter as the target entity.\n* Errors when placing entities next to each other:\n  - Could not place burner-inserter next to x=17.0 y=72.0 with spacing 0 and direction Direction.DOWN. \n  - A stone-furnace already exists at the new position {x = 17, y = 73.5}. \n  - Consider increasing the spacing (0), changing the direction or changing the reference position ({x = 17, y = 72).\n* Errors when placing inserter near a furnace:\n  - Could not place burner-inserter next to x=17.0 y=74.0 with direction Direction.UP. \n  - A burner-mining-drill already exists at a nearby position. \n  - Consider changing the direction or changing the reference position ({x = 17, y = 74).\n* Errors when finding nearest entity from an empty sequence:\n  - Ensure that the list of entities is not empty before attempting to find the nearest entity.\n* Errors when attempting to get an entity that does not exist at a specified position:\n  - Could not get Prototype.WoodenChest at position x=17.5 y=73.5. \n  - Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n* Errors when inserting items into a furnace without having the required items in inventory:\n  - Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory. \n  - Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them.\n* Errors when mining drills run out of fuel:\n  - Mining drill at x=17.0 y=72.0 status: EntityStatus.NO_FUEL. \n  - Ensure that you fuel the mining drills regularly to avoid downtime.\n* Errors when attempting to access the 'position' attribute of a 'Position' object:\n  - 'Position' object has no attribute 'position'. \n  - Ensure that you are accessing the correct attribute or property of the object.\n* Errors when placing entities at a location that is occupied or unplaceable:\n  - Could not place burner-mining-drill at the target location - something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable (water). \n  - Ensure that the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nThe following variables have been assigned:\n- `iron_ore_patch`: Position(x=15.5, y=70.5)\n- `drill`: BurnerMiningDrill object\n- `furnace`: StoneFurnace object\n- `belts`: TransportBelt object\n\nThe following functions have been defined by the agent, but their signatures are not available in the provided logs. However, based on the error messages, we can infer the following:\n- `place_entity(entity_type, position, direction)`: Places an entity at the specified position and direction.\n  - Failure mode: Could not place entity at the target location - something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable.\n  - Success mode: Entity is placed successfully at the target location.\n- `connect_entities(entity1, entity2, entity_type)`: Connects two entities with the specified entity type.\n  - Failure mode: 'Position' object has no attribute 'position'.\n  - Success mode: Entities are connected successfully.\n\nNote that the exact function signatures and descriptions may vary based on the actual code."}
