{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5) \n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are not blocked by other objects. Check the surrounding area for any obstructing pipes or structures before attempting to connect.\n- Verify that the offshore pump is properly connected to a fluid source and that the boiler is connected to the steam engine without any placement blockage.\n\n### Errors when using electric networks\n- Make sure that all electric poles are properly placed and connected to the electric network to avoid any power issues. Check the status of the poles and ensure they are not too far from the entities they are meant to power.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities that may block the placement of new structures."}
