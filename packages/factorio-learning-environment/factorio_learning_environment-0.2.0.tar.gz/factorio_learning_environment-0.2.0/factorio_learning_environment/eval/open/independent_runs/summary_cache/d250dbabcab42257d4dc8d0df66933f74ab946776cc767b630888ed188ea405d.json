{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo composite structures have been successfully created on the map in these steps. Several recovery attempts were made to place a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but all placement efforts failed. No other multi-entity structures (such as power generators, mining setups, or factories) have been added to the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API parameter usage errors\n  \u2013 When calling get_entities, avoid using unsupported keywords (for example, \u201cradius\u201d) and verify the function\u2019s signature to prevent passing unexpected positional arguments.\n\u2022 Placement validation errors\n  \u2013 Confirm that the necessary items (such as a Lab) are present in the inventory before attempting placement at a designated coordinate.\n\u2022 Iteration over missing entities\n  \u2013 Check that the result of an entity retrieval call is not None before iterating over it to avoid \u201cNoneType\u201d errors.\n\u2022 Crafting resource shortages\n  \u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (for instance, iron-gear-wheels and electronic-circuits) are available before attempting to craft a Lab. This includes verifying that prerequisite smelting and intermediate production steps are complete so that crafting recipes can be satisfied."}
