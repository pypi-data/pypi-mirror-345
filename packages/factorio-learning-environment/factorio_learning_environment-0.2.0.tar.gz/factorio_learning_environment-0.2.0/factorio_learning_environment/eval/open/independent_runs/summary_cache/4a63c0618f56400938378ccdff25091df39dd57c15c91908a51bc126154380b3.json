{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Contains iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Transfers iron ore from the Wooden Chest to the Stone Furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory to refuel all necessary entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Misalignment and Repositioning of Inserters\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring items between entities. Misalignment can lead to production halts.\n\n### Inventory Space Management\n- Regularly extract items from chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Plan inventory space to accommodate the output of your production facilities.\n\n### Furnace Operation Without Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly supply the furnace with iron ore to maintain iron plate production.\n\n### Entity Status Monitoring\n- Pay attention to the status and warnings of entities, such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" or \"chest at drop position is full,\" to promptly address issues and maintain efficient operations."}
