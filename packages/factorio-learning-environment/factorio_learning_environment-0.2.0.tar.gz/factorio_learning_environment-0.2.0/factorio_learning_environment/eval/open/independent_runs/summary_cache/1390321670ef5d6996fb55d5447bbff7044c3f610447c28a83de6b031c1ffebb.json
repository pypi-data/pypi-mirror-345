{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled with coal, currently processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) fueled with coal, currently processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) used for coal storage.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing extracted coal.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the chest to other locations.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for additional coal storage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has the necessary items before the inserter attempts to transfer them. This can be mitigated by regularly checking the inventory of the source entity and ensuring it is adequately stocked.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
