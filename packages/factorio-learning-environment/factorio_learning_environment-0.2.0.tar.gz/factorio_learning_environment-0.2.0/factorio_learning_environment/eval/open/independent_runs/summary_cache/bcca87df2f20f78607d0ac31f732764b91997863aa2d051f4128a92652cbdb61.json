Check that the source entity is in place and contains items.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Verify that the target position for placing an entity is unoccupied. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary.\n\n### Errors extracting items from transport belts\n- Confirm that the transport belt contains the items you intend to extract. Ensure the belt is functioning and has the required items before attempting extraction.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity connected to the inserter contains items. Refill or replace the source entity if it is empty."}
