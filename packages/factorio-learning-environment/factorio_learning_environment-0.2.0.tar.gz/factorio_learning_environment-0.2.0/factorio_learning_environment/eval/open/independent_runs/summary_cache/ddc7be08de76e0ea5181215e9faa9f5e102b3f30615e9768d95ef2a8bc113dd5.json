Conflicting placements\u2014such as overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts, particularly near (8.5, 22.5)\u2014continue to block a clear buildable area.\n  \u2013 To mitigate, remove or reposition the interfering entities, redesign adjacent connection interfaces to expand available buildable space, or relocate the extra steam engine to a less congested area.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Network Connection Warnings:\n  \u2013 Several steam engines are reported as not connected to the power network and are missing proper fluid input.\n  \u2013 Verify that each steam engine\u2019s connection points align with the boiler\u2019s output and that both electrical and fluid networks are properly integrated.\n\n\u2022 Research Lab Power Connectivity Issue:\n  \u2013 Lab units maintain a NO_POWER status, indicating ongoing electrical integration problems.\n  \u2013 Review and reconfigure the electrical grid layout to ensure that lab components are correctly connected to the primary power network."}
