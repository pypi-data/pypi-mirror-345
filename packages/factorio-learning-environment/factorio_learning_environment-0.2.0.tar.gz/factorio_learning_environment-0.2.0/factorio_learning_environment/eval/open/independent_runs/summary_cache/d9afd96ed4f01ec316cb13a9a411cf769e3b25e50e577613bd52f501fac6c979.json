{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) which is currently working and has a fuel inventory of 4 coal. It produces iron plates and has a result inventory containing 44 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) which currently holds 6 iron ore.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) which currently holds 634 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) which is currently working and has a fuel inventory of 3 coal. It is extracting iron ore and has a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5). It has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to inventory capacity**: The burner mining drill has a warning that the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. To avoid this issue, regularly check and empty the wooden chest to ensure it can receive more resources.\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**: Ensure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `position`: tuple (float, float)"}
