{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-13.5, 20.0)\n- Steam engine at position (not specified, but assumed nearby)\n- Offshore pump (not specified, but assumed nearby)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (-17.5, 23.5)\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity group at position (-18.166666666666668, 21.055555555555557)\n- Electricity group at position (-17.45, 24.55)\n- Electricity group at position (-21.227272727272727, 24.90909090909091)\n- Electricity group at position (-17.67241379310345, 23.46551724137931)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure there are no obstructions before attempting to place an electric pole near other entities such as labs or assembling machines.\n\n### Errors related to entity power status\n- Check the power connections to ensure entities like labs and assembling machines are receiving power. If they are marked as 'NO_POWER', verify that they are connected to a power source.\n\n### Errors when using undefined names\n- Ensure that all entity classes are correctly defined and imported in your code to avoid NameError. For example, use 'ElectricityPole' instead of 'Electric'.\n\n### Repeated errors with power status\n- The lab at position (-17.5, 23.5) and the assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) are both marked as 'NO_POWER'. Verify their connections to the electricity network to ensure they receive power."}
