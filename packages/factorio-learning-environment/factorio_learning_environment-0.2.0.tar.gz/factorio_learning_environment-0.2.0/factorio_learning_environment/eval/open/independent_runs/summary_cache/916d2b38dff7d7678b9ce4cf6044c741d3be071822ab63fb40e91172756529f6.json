{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the boiler and steam engine at positions (-5.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity Group at position (-5.4, 20.0) which is not yet plugged into the electric network\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Currently has no ingredients and is not operational\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Electricity Network Connection\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity network are properly connected. The electricity group at position (-5.4, 20.0) is not plugged into the electric network. Verify connections between poles and ensure they are within range.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Make sure to maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to keep the boiler operational. There were instances where coal could not be inserted due to insufficient inventory.\n\n### Errors with List Indexing\n- Avoid accessing list elements without checking if the list is populated. An error occurred due to attempting to access an index that was out of range. Implement checks to ensure lists are not empty before accessing their elements.\n\n### Errors with Ingredient Supply\n- The stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is lacking ingredients. Ensure that necessary materials are supplied to keep production running smoothly."}
