{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in an empty map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is not occupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, ore inserters, plate inserters, and output chests failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors with positioning and movement\n- When using functions that require position indices, ensure that the indices are integers. Errors occurred when attempting to move using string indices.\n- Verify that the 'Position' object is used correctly and is callable when attempting to move to specific areas. Errors were encountered when trying to move to Wooden Chest and Stone Furnace areas due to incorrect usage of the 'Position' object.\n\n### Errors with building box size\n- Adjust the size of the BuildingBox or use multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if no viable placement is found near the center position. An error was encountered due to the inability to place a Wooden Chest with the specified BuildingBox size."}
