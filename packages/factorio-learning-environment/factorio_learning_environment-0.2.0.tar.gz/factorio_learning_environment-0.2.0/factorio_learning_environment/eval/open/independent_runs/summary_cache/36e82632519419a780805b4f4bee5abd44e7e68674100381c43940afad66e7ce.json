{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a drop position at wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5). It is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing an inventory with iron ore. The chest is currently normal in status.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace is currently not working due to having no ingredients to smelt and its result inventory being full with iron plates.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing an inventory with iron ore and iron plates. The chest is currently normal in status.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to full chest**: The burner mining drill has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full. To mitigate this, ensure to regularly empty the chest or increase storage capacity.\n- **Errors when furnace has no ingredients**: The stone furnace is not working due to having no ingredients to smelt. Make sure to provide the necessary raw materials for the furnace to operate effectively.\n- **Errors when furnace result is full**: The stone furnace cannot output more iron plates as its result inventory is full. Regularly check and empty the furnace's output to maintain production flow.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the current steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `furnace_status`: str\n  - `chest_status`: str"}
