{"content": "Based on the repeated interactions, I can provide an analysis of the Factorio API patterns:\n\nKey Observations:\n1. Resource Gathering Pattern:\n```python\nstone_pos = nearest(Resource.Stone)  # Consistently returns coordinates (x,y)\nmove_to(stone_pos)                   # Must move before harvesting\nharvest_resource(stone_pos, quantity=n)  # Returns gathered amount\n```\n\n2. Inventory Management:\n- Initial stone: 0\n- After harvesting 10 stone: inventory shows 10 stone\n- After crafting furnace: 5 stone remaining (confirms furnace costs 5 stone)\n- Inventory is maintained as a dictionary with item:quantity pairs\n\n3. Crafting Pattern:\n```python\nif inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0) >= 5:  # Check requirements\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)      # Crafts immediately if requirements met\n```\n\nSuccessful Patterns:\n1. Always check inventory before crafting\n2. Gather more resources than minimum needed (buffer)\n3. Move before harvesting\n4. Verify results after each operation\n\nCommon Operations:\n- nearest() - Returns coordinates\n- move_to() - Requires coordinates\n- harvest_resource() - Requires position and quantity\n- inspect_inventory() - Returns dictionary\n- craft_item() - Requires prototype\n\nTips for Future Use:\n1. Keep track of recipe requirements\n2. Always verify inventory after operations\n3. Use get() method with default value when checking inventory\n4. Chain operations: find -> move -> harvest -> craft\n5. Consider gathering extra resources for future use\n\nError Prevention:\n1. Check inventory before crafting\n2. Ensure player is at resource location before harvesting\n3. Verify resource quantities meet recipe requirements\n4. Handle inventory checks with .get() to avoid KeyErrors\n\nThe API appears to be consistent and reliable, with predictable behavior across multiple interactions.", "summary_range": "[1-2474]"}
