We should gather more resources, especially coal and iron ore, to keep both furnaces operational.\n2. We can also consider crafting additional entities like mining drills or inserters to automate our resource collection and processing.\n\nLet's start by gathering more iron ore and coal to ensure we have enough materials for continued operations.\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1.
