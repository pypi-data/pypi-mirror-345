{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59) smelting copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) collecting copper plates\n\n### Iron Production Line at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10, -59), (-8, -59), and (-6, -59) mining iron ore\n- Three wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\n- Current chest inventories show 78, 77, and 76 iron ore respectively\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n- Four input burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5)\n- Four output burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- Four input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) containing coal\n- Four output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5) containing iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with output blocking\n- When setting up mining drills, ensure there is a valid output entity (like a chest or belt) at the drill's drop position before starting operation\n- The copper mining drill is showing warnings about blocked output - verify proper alignment between drill's drop position and furnace input\n\n### Errors with resource insertion\n- Ensure you have the required resources in inventory before attempting to insert them into entities\n- When refueling, check coal availability in inventory before attempting mass refueling operations\n\n### Entity placement alignment\n- Pay attention to exact drop positions when placing entities that need to interact\n- Use the entity's reported drop_position property to ensure proper alignment between connected entities"}
