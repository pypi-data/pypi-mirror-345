{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row mining iron ore:\n- First drill at (-10, -59) outputting to wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Second drill at (-8, -59) outputting to wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Third drill at (-6, -59) outputting to stone furnace at (-5, -57)\nAll drills are operational and mining iron ore\n\n### Coal Processing System at (0, -2.5)\nFour wooden chests storing coal in a row:\n- Chest at (0.5, -2.5)\n- Chest at (2.5, -2.5)\n- Chest at (4.5, -2.5)\n- Chest at (6.5, -2.5)\nEach chest contains 40 coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- Four stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n- Four burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving items from coal chests to furnaces\n- Four wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5) collecting processed iron plates\n- Additional burner inserter at (7.5, 0.5) for material movement\nThe furnaces contain varying amounts of coal and iron plates in their output slots\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Mining Output Blockage\n- Ensure proper output collection entities (chests or furnaces) are placed exactly at the drop position of mining drills\n- Current issue with third drill at (-6, -59) showing output blockage despite furnace placement suggests precise positioning is critical\n\n### Resource Management\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings indicate need for proper input feed system\n- Ensure consistent material flow from mining to smelting operations\n\n### Entity Placement\n- When placing entities that interact with mining drills, verify exact drop position coordinates\n- Use the drill's drop_position property to determine correct placement locations for output collection entities"}
