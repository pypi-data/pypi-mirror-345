{"content": "Great! You've successfully placed the offshore pump, and it is now working. Let's proceed with setting up the rest of the power generation system to provide electricity to your assembling machine.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Power Setup:\n\n1. **Place a Boiler:**\n   - Place a boiler adjacent to the offshore pump to start converting water into steam. The boiler should be connected to the offshore pump's output.\n\n2. **Place a Steam Engine:**\n   - Connect a steam engine to the boiler. This will generate electricity from the steam produced by the boiler.\n\n3. **Fuel the Boiler:**\n   - Ensure the boiler has enough fuel (coal) to operate. Insert coal into the boiler.\n\n4. **Connect the Steam Engine to the Assembling Machine:**\n   - Use small electric poles to connect the steam engine to the assembling machine. Ensure the poles form a continuous line from the steam engine to the machine.\n\n### Example Code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Place the boiler next to the offshore pump\nboiler_position = offshore_pump.position.right()  # Adjust based on layout\nboiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, Direction.UP, boiler_position)\nassert boiler, \"Failed to place boiler.\"\n\n# Step 2: Place the steam engine next to the boiler\nsteam_engine_position = boiler.position.right()  # Adjust based on layout\nsteam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, Direction.UP, steam_engine_position)\nassert steam_engine, \"Failed to place steam engine.\"\n\n# Step 3: Fuel the boiler with coal\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Inserted coal into the boiler for steam generation.\")\n\n# Step 4: Connect the steam engine to the assembling machine using small electric poles\n# Ensure the poles cover from the steam engine to the assembling machine\nconnect_entities(steam_engine, assembling_machine_position, Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nprint(\"Connected power system with small electric poles.\")\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips:\n\n- **Ensure Connectivity:** Double-check that all entities (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine, and assembling machine) are connected correctly.\n- **Check Fuel Levels:** Make sure the boiler has enough coal to keep producing steam.\n- **Verify Pole Placement:** Ensure that the electric poles are placed correctly to connect the steam engine to the assembling machine.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to power your assembling machine and resolve the \"NO_POWER\" issue.", "summary_range": "[1-148]"}
