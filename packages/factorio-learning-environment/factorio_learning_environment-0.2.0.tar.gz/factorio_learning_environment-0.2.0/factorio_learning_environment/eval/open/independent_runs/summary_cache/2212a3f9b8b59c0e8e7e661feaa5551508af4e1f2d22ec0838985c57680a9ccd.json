{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring items from the Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) to another Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- A second Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) is connected to the Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -77.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) dropping iron ore into a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting to transfer items from the Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-8.5, -48.5) and (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters are not empty or blocked. Check for any blockages or missing items that may prevent the inserters from functioning properly.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest. Consider using additional storage or automated logistics to manage overflow.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that the stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) has a consistent supply of iron ore to maintain continuous production of iron plates. Check the supply chain leading to the furnace for any disruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items, including 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
