{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position: 16.0, 71.0)\n- Wooden chest (position: 16.5, 72.5) to collect iron ore\n- Burner inserter (position: 17.5, 72.5) to move iron ore from chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace (position: 17.0, 74.0) \n- Burner inserter (position: 18.5, 74.5) to move iron plates into assembling machine\n- Assembling machine 2 (position: 20.5, 74.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Solar panel (position: 24.5, 74.5) connected to the assembling machine via a small electric pole (position: 22.5, 74.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when attempting to insert items into an entity without having the required items in inventory\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n- Errors when trying to access non-existent attributes of an object\n  - Ensure that the attribute you are trying to access exists for the object. Check the object's documentation or inspect its properties.\n- Errors when calling a function with incorrect keyword arguments\n  - Verify that the function is called with the correct keyword arguments. Check the function's documentation for the correct usage.\n- Errors when attempting to get the nearest entity of a specific type that does not exist on the surface\n  - Verify that at least one entity of the specified type exists on the surface before attempting to get the nearest one.\n- Errors when inspecting inventory attributes that do not exist\n  - Ensure that the inventory attribute you are trying to access exists for the entity. Check the entity's documentation or inspect its properties.\n- Errors when placing entities too far away from the current position\n  - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n- Errors when attempting to place an entity next to an existing entity with insufficient spacing\n  - Increase the spacing or adjust the direction when placing entities next to existing ones to avoid overlap.\n- Errors when attempting to insert items into a furnace without having the required fuel\n  - Although not directly observed, the burner mining drill and inserter have warnings about being out of fuel. Ensure that entities that require fuel have sufficient fuel.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- Important variables:\n  - `Prototype.IronOre`: type=Prototype\n  - `furnace`: type=Entity\n  - `assembling_machine`: type=Entity\n  - `position`: type=Position\n  - `iron_ore_chest`: type=Entity (wooden chest at position (16.5, 72.5))\n- Functions: None defined."}
