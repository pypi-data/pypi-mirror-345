{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-13.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple Pipe Groups connecting various positions, including:\n  - Pipe Group at position (-9.5, 23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT\n  - Other Pipe Groups at various positions, mostly EMPTY\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure the target position for placing pipes is clear of existing objects. If an entity already exists at the target position, remove it before attempting to place a new pipe.\n- Avoid placing pipes in positions where the entity footprint overlaps with water or other obstacles. Choose a different location for placement.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Verify that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected to form a continuous network. If a connection fails, check the alignment and connectivity of the pipes involved.\n  \n### Inventory Management for Pipe-to-Ground\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the necessary items, such as pipe-to-ground, before attempting to place them. If the item is missing from the inventory, it cannot be placed."}
