{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x=52.0, y=-82.0) and \n-  Furnace (position x=52.0, y=-80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position x=52.5, y=-83.5) \n-  Belt group (position x=52.5, y=-84.5) that connects the burner mining drill at position x=52.0, y=-82.0 to the furnace at position x=52.0, y=-80.0\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(x=53.5, y=-78.5)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Furnace (position x=62.0, y=-54.0) \n-  Burner inserter (position x=53.5, y=-78.5) \n-  Belt group that connects the furnace at position x=62.0, y=-54.0 to the burner inserter at position x=53.5, y=-78.5\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Check if the target position is occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Make sure there is a valid path to connect the entities. Check if the entities are in the same network and if the transport belts are correctly placed.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Check if the furnace has enough space to insert the items. Ensure the furnace is not full before attempting to insert items.\n- Check if you have the required items to insert into the furnace. Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them.\n\n### Errors when furnace fuel source is full\n- Check if the furnace fuel source is full before attempting to insert more fuel. Ensure you have enough space in the furnace fuel source to insert more fuel.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Utility functions:\n\t+ `place_entity`: Places an entity at a specified position.\n\t+ `connect_entities`: Connects two entities with a transport belt.\n\t+ `insert_item`: Inserts an item into a furnace.\n* Important variables:\n\t+ `inserter_from_drill`: Burner inserter entity.\n\t+ `inserter_to_furnace`: Burner inserter entity.\n\t+ `drill`: Burner mining drill entity.\n\t+ `furnace`: Furnace entity.\n\t+ `belt_group`: Belt group entity."}
