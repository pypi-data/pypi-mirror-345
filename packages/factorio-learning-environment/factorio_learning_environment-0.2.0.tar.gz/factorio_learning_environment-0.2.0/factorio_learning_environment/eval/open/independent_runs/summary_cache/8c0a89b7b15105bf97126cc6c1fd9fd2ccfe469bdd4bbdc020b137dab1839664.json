{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-40.5, y=-113.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-47.5, y=-123.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump and steam engine, with pipes at positions including (x=-47.5, y=-122.5), (x=-46.5, y=-122.5), ..., (x=-38.5, y=-111.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-73.0) with a source inventory of iron ore and a result inventory of copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with coal as fuel\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=7.5, y=-61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) connected to the chest and furnaces\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple pipe networks exist, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-47.5, y=-122.5) with water\n- Several empty PipeGroups at various positions, such as (x=-1.5, y=11.5), (x=-0.5, y=17.5), (x=-12.5, y=23.5), etc.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (x=7.5, y=-15.5), (x=15.5, y=-14.5), ..., (x=5.5, y=27.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that there is no blockage in the path when attempting to connect pipes. Verify that the path between the two entities is clear and that the correct positions are being targeted for connection.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items\n- Before crafting an item, ensure that all required raw resources are available. For example, wood is a raw resource that must be gathered before crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Power Connectivity\n- Make sure all components that require power are connected to the electricity network. Check that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and that there are no warnings about missing connections.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent machines, like burner mining drills and furnaces, have adequate fuel to operate. Regularly check and refuel these machines to prevent operation halts."}
