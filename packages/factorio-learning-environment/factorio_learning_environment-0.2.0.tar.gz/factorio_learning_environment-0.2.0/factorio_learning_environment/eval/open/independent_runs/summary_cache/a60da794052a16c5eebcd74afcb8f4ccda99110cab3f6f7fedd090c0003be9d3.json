{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully established on the map. Multiple attempts were made to supply a Lab (intended to receive Automation Science Packs for advancing research) at position (0.5, 2.5), but placement or crafting failed due to inventory and resource issues. Existing furnaces used for smelting were referenced but not newly created as map structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API Calls for Entity Retrieval\n\u2003\u2013 Calling get_entities with unsupported keywords (e.g. using a 'radius' parameter) or an incorrect number of positional arguments causes TypeErrors. Use the correct function signature and parameter order.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Verification\n\u2003\u2013 Failures to place the Lab arise when there is no lab available in inventory. Verify and ensure that the necessary Lab item is present before attempting placement.\n\u2022 Handling None Values in Entity Retrieval\n\u2003\u2013 When get_entities returns None, iterating over the result leads to a TypeError. Implement a check or fallback to an empty list to avoid iterating a NoneType.\n\u2022 Insufficient Resources for Lab Crafting\n\u2003\u2013 Lab crafting repeatedly fails due to missing sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables) caused by shortages in primary resources like iron plates and copper plates. Ensure that all prerequisite smelting and production steps are completed and that sufficient resources are available before retrying lab crafting."}
