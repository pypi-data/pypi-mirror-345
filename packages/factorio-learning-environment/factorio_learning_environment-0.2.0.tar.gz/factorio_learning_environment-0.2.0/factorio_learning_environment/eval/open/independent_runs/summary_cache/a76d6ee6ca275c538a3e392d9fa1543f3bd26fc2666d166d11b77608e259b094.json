{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -82)\nComplex automation system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal from drill\n- Two burner inserters:\n  1. First inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving items from chest to belt\n  2. Second inserter at (43.5, -80.5) moving items from belt to furnace\n- Transport belt system starting at (42.5, -81.5) extending to (43.5, -81.5)\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n\nCurrent status: System is partially working\n- Mining drill is operational with coal fuel\n- Chest is collecting coal (759 units stored)\n- Both inserters are fueled but waiting for items\n- Furnace has fuel but no ingredients to process\n- Belt system is currently empty\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the intended source and destination\n- When setting up inserter chains, verify the complete path of items from source to destination\n- Pay attention to inserter rotation direction relative to belts and containers\n\n2. Furnace Setup Issues\n- Ensure proper input feed mechanism is established before expecting furnace operation\n- Verify complete material flow path from source to furnace\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\nNone explicitly defined in the logs\n\nFunctions:\nNone explicitly defined in the logs\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Used for operational mining drills\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Used for inserters waiting for items\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Used for furnaces without materials to process\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: Used for empty belt systems\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Used for basic containers like chests"}
