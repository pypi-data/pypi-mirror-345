{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-9.5, -2.5) - Still disconnected (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Boiler** at (3.5, 0.0) - Still not receiving water (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Pipe Network** (system 16923):\n  - Pipes at (1.5, -0.5) and (1.5, -1.5)\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n\n### Oil Processing Complex (Updated)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Connected to:\n  - Pipe-to-ground at (18.5, 38.5)\n  - Fast inserter at (15.5, 40.5) moving coal from wooden chest\n  - Status: NO_POWER (300,000 crude oil available)\n\n- **Oil Refinery** at (27.5, 40.5) - Configured for basic oil processing\n  - Input connection at (28.5, 43.5)\n  - Output connection at (29.5, 37.5)\n  - Status: NO_POWER\n\n- **Chemical Plant** at (37.5, 40.5) - Configured for plastic production\n  - Input connection at (38.5, 42.5)\n  - Status: NO_POWER (missing coal input)\n\n- **Support Infrastructure**:\n  - Wooden chests at (14.5,40.5), (23.5,40.5), (34.5,40.5) containing coal\n  - Fast inserters at (15.5,40.5), (24.5,40.5), (35.5,40.5) - all NO_POWER\n\n### New Power Plant (Unchanged)\n- **Boiler** at (35.5, 47.0) - Fueled with coal but no water input\n- **Steam Engine** at (46.5, 40.5) - Connected to power pole but not receiving steam\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Unchanged)\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at (34.5, 20.5) - Connected to power pole\n- **Transport Belt System** moving coal (status: WORKING)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues (Updated)\n- Water placement violations (steps 121,123,124,125) - Implement dry-land verification before all placements\n- Assertion failures (steps 120,126,127) - Validate entity existence before status checks\n- Insertion failures (step 122) - Verify entity can accept items before insertion\n\n### Power System Issues (New)\n- Multiple NO_POWER states - Connect all production buildings to power network\n- Inserter power failures - Ensure inserters are within power pole coverage\n- Recipe execution blocked - Power required before production can begin\n\n### Construction Best Practices (Updated)\n1. Implement complete dry-land verification for all placements\n2. Validate entity existence before status checks\n3. Connect all production buildings to power network\n4. Verify inserter power coverage\n5. Ensure power before attempting production\n6. Check entity can accept items before insertion\n7. Maintain proper distance (<10 tiles) during placements\n8. Clear entire pipe routes before connection attempts\n9. Validate placement conditions before asserting success\n10. Check connection point orientations match before connecting"}
