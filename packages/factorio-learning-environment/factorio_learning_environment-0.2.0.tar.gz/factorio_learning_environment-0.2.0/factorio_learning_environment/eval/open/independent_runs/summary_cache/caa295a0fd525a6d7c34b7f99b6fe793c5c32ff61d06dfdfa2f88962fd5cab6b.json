{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for temporary storage of mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-5.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-7.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring resources between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Secondary Furnace Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring materials to and from the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) for storing processed materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Ensure that the position where you intend to place a new entity is not already occupied by another entity. Remove any existing entity before placing a new one.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Gather necessary raw resources before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is a raw resource that must be gathered before crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Errors in Using API Functions\n- When using the `place_entity` function, ensure that the arguments are correctly specified. The second argument should be a `Direction` object, not a position.\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map. If an item is not in your inventory, it cannot be placed.\n\n### Inserter Warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"inserter waiting for source items\" by ensuring that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up.\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked to prevent warnings like \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked.\"\n\n### Planning for Expansion\n- Consider planning for future expansion by utilizing accumulated resources effectively. This includes expanding storage capacity and ensuring continuous resource supply."}
