{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) for transferring coal from the mining drill to storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for storing coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., mining drill or chest) has items available for the inserter to transfer. Check the inventory levels and ensure the inserter is correctly positioned to pick up items.\n\n### Monitoring Coal Levels\n- Regularly check and refuel entities that require coal to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that coal supply is sufficient and distributed efficiently among all entities that require it.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources such as wood, coal, and iron plates.\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Monitors the contents of the stone furnace, including iron ore and iron plates."}
