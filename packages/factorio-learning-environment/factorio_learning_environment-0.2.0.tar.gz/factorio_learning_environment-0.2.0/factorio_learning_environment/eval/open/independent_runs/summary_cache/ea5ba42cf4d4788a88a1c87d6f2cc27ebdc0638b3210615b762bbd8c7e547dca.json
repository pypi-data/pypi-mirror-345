{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=16.0, y=71.0)\n- Chest (position x=15.5, y=69.5) to collect iron ore\n- Burner Inserter (position x=14.5, y=69.5) to output iron ore from chest (currently facing down, pickup position x=14.5 y=68.5, drop position x=14.5 y=70.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position x=16.5, y=69.5) to input iron ore into furnace (currently facing right, pickup position x=15.5 y=69.5, drop position x=17.5 y=69.5)\n- BeltGroup (positions x=14.5 y=70.5, x=17.5 y=69.5) that connects the output inserter to the input inserter (inventory has 17 iron ore)\n- Furnace (position x=19.0, y=71.0) to smelt iron ore into iron plates\n- Chest (position x=21.5, y=71.5) to collect iron plates\n- Burner Inserter (position x=20.5, y=71.5) to output iron plates into chest (currently facing left, pickup position x=21.5 y=71.5, drop position x=19.5 y=71.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position x=19.5, y=68.5) to output iron plates from furnace (currently facing down, pickup position x=19.5 y=67.5, drop position x=19.5 y=69.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position x=20.5, y=68.5) to transfer iron plates to output chest (currently facing left, pickup position x=21.5 y=68.5, drop position x=19.5 y=68.5)\n- BeltGroup (positions x=19.5 y=69.5, x=21.5 y=68.5) that connects the furnace output inserter to the output chest\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities too close to other entities\n  - Ensure sufficient spacing between entities to avoid collisions\n  - Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction when placing entities next to each other\n* Errors when connecting entities directly\n  - Use inserters to take items from source entities (e.g., chests, furnaces) before connecting to other entities\n* Errors when attempting to place entities at occupied positions\n  - Check if a position is occupied before attempting to place an entity\n* Errors when connecting transport belts to entities that are not compatible\n  - Ensure that transport belts are connected to compatible entities (e.g., inserters, other transport belts)\n  - Avoid connecting transport belts directly to chests or other entities that do not support direct belt connections\n* Syntax errors\n  - Ensure that 'return' statements are used within functions\n* Errors when inserters are not correctly oriented\n  - Check the direction of inserters to ensure they are correctly picking up and dropping off items\n* Errors when transport belts are blocked\n  - Clear the belt at the blocked position to continue mining or processing\n  - As seen in step 50, 56, and 66, clearing the belt at x=17.5 y=69.5 resolved the blockage\n* Errors when attempting to retrieve entities at non-existent positions\n  - Verify that the position of the entity exists before attempting to retrieve it\n* Errors when attempting to insert items into furnaces without sufficient ingredients\n  - Check if the furnace has sufficient ingredients before attempting to insert more items\n  - As seen in step 52, 58, and 71, the furnace was waiting for ingredients\n* Errors when connecting transport belts with invalid paths\n  - Ensure that transport belts are connected in a valid path to avoid normalisation failures\n* Errors when normalising belt connections\n  - Check that the belt connection path is valid and can be normalised\n* Errors when entities are running out of fuel\n  - Refuel entities (e.g., burner mining drills, furnaces) before they run out of fuel\n  - As seen in step 55, the drill needed refueling\n* Errors when attempting to extract items from empty belts\n  - Check if the belt has items before attempting to extract\n  - As seen in step 57, 62, and 66, attempting to extract iron-ore from an empty belt resulted in an error\n* Errors when attempting to insert items into furnaces with incompatible ingredients\n  - Check if the furnace already contains a product before attempting to insert ingredients\n  - As seen in step 58, the furnace already contained iron"}
