{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate smelter at position (18.0, 71.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (18.0, 71.0)\n\n### Iron gear wheel factory at position (20.5, 71.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine 2 at position (20.5, 71.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them. For example, 'iron' is not defined.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an entity\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item you are trying to extract. For example, trying to extract 'iron-plate' from a furnace that does not contain it.\n\n### Errors when getting entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before trying to get it. For example, trying to get a 'steam-engine' at a position where it does not exist.\n- Ensure that the list of entities is not empty before trying to access its elements. For example, trying to access the first element of an empty list of 'steam-engine' entities.\n\n### Errors when entities are not connected to a power network\n- Ensure that entities that require power are connected to a power network. For example, the 'assembling-machine-2' at position (20.5, 71.5) is not connected to a power network.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: count of iron ore in the inventory (int)\n- `copper-ore`: count of copper ore in the inventory (int)\n- `coal`: count of coal in the inventory (int)\n- `iron-plate`: count of iron plates in the inventory (int)\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs."}
