Previous operations attempted connections with IDs [21092, 21135, 21178, 21221, 21264, 21307, 21350, 21393] and [21436, 21479, 21522, 21565, 21608, 21651, 21694, 21737]. In the current steps, attempts using IDs [21780, 21823, 21866, 21909, 21952, 21995, 22038, 22081] to supply water to the steam engine have also failed. Verify that the specified fluid_system corresponds to a working and properly configured PipeGroup before initiating a connection.\n\n\u2022 Fixed Delay Limitations for Pipeline Stabilization:\n   - A fixed 10-second delay following each connection attempt does not guarantee that the pipeline network is stabilized. Incorporate dynamic readiness checks to confirm network stabilization before retrying connection operations."}
