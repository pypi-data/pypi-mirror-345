{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) which is working and connected to a pipe at position (-9.5, 23.5).\n- Pipe Group at position (-9.5, 23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, containing water.\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) which is not connected.\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) which is not connected.\n- Multiple Pipe Groups connecting various positions:\n  - Pipe Group at position (-5.5, 16.5) with status EMPTY.\n  - Pipe Group at position (-7.5, 24.5) with status EMPTY.\n  - Pipe Group at position (-4.5, 24.5) with status EMPTY.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, indicating it lacks materials to smelt.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity Group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715) with status NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK, indicating it is not connected to the electric network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before placing pipes. Avoid placing pipes where the entity footprint overlaps with water or existing objects.\n- Verify that you have the necessary pipes in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors in Crafting\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items. For crafting pipe-to-ground, ensure sufficient iron plates are available.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Ensure that all components of a structure are properly connected. For example, the steam engine and boiler need to be connected to the offshore pump and pipe network to function correctly.\n\n### Attribute Errors\n- Double-check the attribute names when using prototypes. Ensure correct usage, such as using 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround'.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and update your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for crafting and building."}
