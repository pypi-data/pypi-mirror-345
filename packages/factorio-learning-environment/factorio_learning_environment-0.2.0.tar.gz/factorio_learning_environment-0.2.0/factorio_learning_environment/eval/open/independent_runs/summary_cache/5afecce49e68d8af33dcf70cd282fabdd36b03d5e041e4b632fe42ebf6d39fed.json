Avoid placing it on occupied or non-buildable tiles.  \n\n#### Errors when inserting coal into a furnace\n- Verify that the furnace is placed correctly and is accessible before attempting to insert coal. Ensure the furnace is within range and not obstructed.  \n\n#### Repeated attempts to place a furnace at the same invalid position\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to place a furnace at the same invalid position (x=51.5, y=-79.0). Check for valid positions nearby.  \n\n#### Errors when extracting or inserting items without proper entity proximity\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity (e.g., chest or furnace) before attempting to extract or insert items. Move to the correct position first."}
