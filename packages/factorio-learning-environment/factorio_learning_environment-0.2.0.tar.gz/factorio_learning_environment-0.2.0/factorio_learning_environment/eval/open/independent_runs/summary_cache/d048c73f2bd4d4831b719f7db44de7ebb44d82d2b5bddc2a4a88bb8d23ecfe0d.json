{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these components\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with an Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the furnaces and inserter\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, primarily for fluid transport, although many are currently empty or not fully connected.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are properly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Check for any obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Make sure to have sufficient fuel, such as coal, in your inventory before attempting to refuel burner mining drills.\n\n### Power Connection Errors\n- Verify that you have the necessary items, such as small electric poles, in your inventory before attempting to connect to the power network. Ensure that electric poles are placed within reach of each other to establish a connection.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check that electric poles are properly connected and supplying power to the inserters.\n\n### Full Output Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
