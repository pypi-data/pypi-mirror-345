{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the burner mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or changing the reference position if there is a collision with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and fuel\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with both the source and destination entities to facilitate proper transfer of items.\n- Regularly refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Furnace not receiving iron ore\n- Verify the inserter setup to ensure that it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for alignment and fuel issues with the inserter."}
