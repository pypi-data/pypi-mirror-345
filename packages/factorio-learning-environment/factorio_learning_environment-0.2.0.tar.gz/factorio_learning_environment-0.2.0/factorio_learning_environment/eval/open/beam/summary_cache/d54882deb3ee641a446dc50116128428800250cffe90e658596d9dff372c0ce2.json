{"content": "I notice that the inserter keeps getting placed at (-11.5, 27.5) instead of our intended position (-10.5, 28.5). Let's try a different approach:\n\n```python\n# First craft the burner inserter\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter)\n\n# Move to a position near where we want to place the inserter\nmove_to(Position(x=-10.0, y=28.0))\n\n# Place the inserter between the belt's output and the furnace input\n# The furnace is at (-10.0, 29.0), and the belt ends at (-10.5, 28.5)\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=Position(x=-10.0, y=28.0),  # Adjusted position to be closer to furnace\n    direction=Direction.UP  # Face up towards furnace\n)\n\nif inserter:\n    # Rotate the inserter to face the correct direction\n    rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.DOWN)\n    # Add fuel\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n    print(f\"Successfully placed and fueled inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Check the results\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Updated entity status: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Places the inserter closer to the furnace\n2. Initially faces it up\n3. Then rotates it to face down to pick up from the belt\n4. Should create a better position for transferring items from belt to furnace\n\nThe goal is to have the inserter:\n- Pickup position: near the belt output (-10.5, 28.5)\n- Drop position: at the furnace input (-10.0, 29.0)", "summary_range": "[1-400]"}
