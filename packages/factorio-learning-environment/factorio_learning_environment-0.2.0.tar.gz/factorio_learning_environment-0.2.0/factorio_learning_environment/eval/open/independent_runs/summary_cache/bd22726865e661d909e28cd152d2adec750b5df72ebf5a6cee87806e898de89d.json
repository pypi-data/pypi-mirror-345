{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Resources: Iron ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity or item. This includes Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts. Verify the tile is free before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- When attempting to retrieve an entity, such as a Stone Furnace, ensure that the entity exists at the specified position. Double-check the coordinates to avoid exceptions related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that the output of entities like Burner Mining Drills is not blocked by items on the ground. Place a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output and prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available for entities like Stone Furnaces to function properly. Ensure the supply chain is intact and ingredients are being delivered to the furnace."}
