For example, attempting to place a wooden chest without having one in inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors with Misaligned Inserters\n- Double-check the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned for both pickup and drop operations. Misalignment can cause inefficiencies or blockages in production lines.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be resolved by checking the inventory of the source entity and ensuring it is not empty.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests Blocking Production\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests to ensure they are not full, as this can block production processes. Empty full chests to allow continuous operation of inserters and mining drills."}
