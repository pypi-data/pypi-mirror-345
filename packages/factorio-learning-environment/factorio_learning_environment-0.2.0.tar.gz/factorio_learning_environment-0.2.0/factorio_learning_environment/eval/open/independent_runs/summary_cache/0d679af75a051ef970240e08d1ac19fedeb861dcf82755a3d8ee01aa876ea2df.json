{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=4.5, y=-58.5), and others used for storing extracted resources.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\". They are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage\n- **Iron Chest** at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) used for storing iron ore extracted from various sources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests that are used as drop positions for mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure a consistent supply of iron ore to the furnaces to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning and keep production continuous.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the final inventory state with quantities of various items.\n- `iron_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the inventory of the iron chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5), containing 'iron-ore' and 'iron-plate'."}
