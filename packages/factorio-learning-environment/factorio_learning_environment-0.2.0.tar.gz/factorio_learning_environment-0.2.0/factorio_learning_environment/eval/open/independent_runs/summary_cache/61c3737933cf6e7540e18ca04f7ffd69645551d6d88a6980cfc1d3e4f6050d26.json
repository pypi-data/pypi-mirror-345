{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-14, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) containing 141 coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) containing 655 iron ore\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) containing 21 copper ore\n- Middle wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5) containing 419 copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n- Burner inserter at (23.5, 21.5) moving items from middle chest to furnace\n\n### Unused Furnaces\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth currently without ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Inserter Positioning\n- When placing inserters between entities, ensure the pickup and drop positions align exactly with the source and destination entities\n- Verify inserter's working positions using the pickup_position and drop_position properties before finalizing placement\n\n### Blocked Inserter Output\n- Before placing inserters, ensure there is a clear path between source and destination\n- Check for any obstacles or entities that might block the inserter's movement path\n- Make sure the destination entity can accept the items being moved\n\n### Furnace Efficiency\n- Monitor furnace warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\"\n- Ensure proper connection between input inserters and furnaces to maintain continuous operation"}
