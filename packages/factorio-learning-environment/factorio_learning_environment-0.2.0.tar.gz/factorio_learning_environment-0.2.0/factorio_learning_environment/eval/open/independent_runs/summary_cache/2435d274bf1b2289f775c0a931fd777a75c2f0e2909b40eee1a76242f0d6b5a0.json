{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to storage and processing units.\n- Stone Furnaces at Positions (-20.0, -70.0), (-18.0, -70.0), and (-21.0, -62.0) for smelting.\n- Wooden Chests at various positions for storing iron plates and ores.\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) for moving items between belts and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport Belts for moving iron ore to furnaces.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at various positions for storing iron ore and plates.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -54.5) for moving items between belts and chests.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chests at various positions for storing miscellaneous items like coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup object is correctly accessed and manipulated. The 'direction' attribute is not directly available on BeltGroup; check the individual belts within the group for direction information.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. Check the supply chain to make sure that items are reaching the inserters.\n\n### General Tips\n- Verify entity attributes before accessing them to prevent attribute errors.\n- Maintain a clear and efficient supply chain to ensure all entities receive necessary resources."}
