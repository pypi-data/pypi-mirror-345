{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Multiple small electric poles connecting the steam engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a wooden chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups at various positions, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (-36.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-48.5, -112.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-37.5, -111.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-43.5, -109.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions for fluid transport\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, connecting different entities to the power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure there are no obstructions blocking the placement of pipes. Clear any obstructions before attempting to connect pipes.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- Verify the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Ensure the entity is correctly placed and not obstructed.\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine Operation\n- Check all connections and ensure that the steam engine has the required input liquid. Verify that all pipes are correctly connected and that there are no blockages in the fluid system.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operation\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Verify that the inserter is within the range of an electric pole and that the pole is connected to a functioning power network."}
