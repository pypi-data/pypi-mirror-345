{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) and Burner Inserter at position (1.5, -0.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) and Burner Inserter at position (3.5, -0.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (4.5, 1.5) and Burner Inserter at position (5.5, 1.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5)\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup with inputs at positions (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-49.5), outputs at positions (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-52.5)\n- BeltGroup with inputs at position (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), outputs at position (x=-13.5, y=-50.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to furnaces\n- Ensure to use an inserter to connect belts to a furnace. Belts cannot be directly connected to a Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters\n- Avoid placing an inserter at a position already occupied by another inserter. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position."}
