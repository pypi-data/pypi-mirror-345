{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (6 units)\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours:\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - Transport Belt at position (x=-12.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-14.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-12.5, y=-51.5)\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the mining drill to the furnace\n  - BeltGroup: Inputs from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction=RIGHT\n  - Outputs from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction=DOWN\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron ore (2 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plate (86 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours:\n    - Transport Belt at position (x=0.5, y=-2.5)\n    - Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=0.5, y=-2.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=0.5, y=-0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is emptied regularly to prevent mining operations from halting.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the current steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `Inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the number of resources like wood, coal, stone, iron-ore, and iron-plate.\n  - `Position`: Tuple[float, float] - Represents the x and y coordinates of entities on the map."}
