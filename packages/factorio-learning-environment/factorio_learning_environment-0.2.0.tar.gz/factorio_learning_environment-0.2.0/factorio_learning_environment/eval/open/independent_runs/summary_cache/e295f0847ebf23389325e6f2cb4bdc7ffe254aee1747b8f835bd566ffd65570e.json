{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-3.5, y=27.5 to x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that the underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. The connection attempt failed, indicating a potential misalignment or incorrect placement of pipes.\n- Verify the status of the entities after connection attempts. The boiler remains in a NOT_CONNECTED state, suggesting that the connection was not established successfully. Double-check the placement and orientation of pipes and entities.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `inventory`: A dictionary containing the current inventory items and their counts.\n  - `boiler_status`: A string indicating the connection status and energy level of the boiler.\n  - `offshore_pump_status`: A string indicating the connection status of the offshore pump."}
