{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=2.0, y=0.0). Both furnaces are fueled with coal and are currently in a status of \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" to smelt.\n- Two burner inserters at positions (x=1.5, y=1.5) and (x=3.5, y=1.5). These inserters are fueled with coal and are in a status of \"WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\". The first inserter picks up from position (x=0.5, y=1.5) and drops at position (x=2.5, y=1.5). The second inserter picks up from position (x=2.5, y=1.5) and drops at position (x=4.5, y=1.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inspecting non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to inspect it. This can be verified by checking the map or using a function to confirm the presence of the entity.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Before using a variable, ensure it is defined and initialized properly. Double-check the variable names for typos and ensure they match the intended identifiers.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
