{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 25.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with key positions at (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 24.5), and (-7.5, 25.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) connected to the power network\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n- Electricity network with poles at positions (17.5, -0.5), (11.5, 6.5), (7.5, 10.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected. Check that there are no gaps or misalignments between pipe segments.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Keep track of inventory levels and ensure you have the necessary items before attempting to insert them into structures. Harvest or craft items as needed to maintain adequate inventory.\n\n### Errors When Inserters Are Not Powered\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Verify that the electricity network is properly established and that poles are connected to provide power to all necessary entities.\n\n### Errors When Inserters Are Misaligned\n- Double-check the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items as intended. Adjust positions if necessary to align with source and destination entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Empty or Misaligned Chests\n- Verify that chests are properly aligned with inserters and other entities they interact with. Ensure they contain the necessary items for production processes."}
