However, persistent congestion\u2014marked by overlapping and misaligned connection elements in the boiler vicinity\u2014has prevented its placement.\n  (The core system remains partially effective despite this unresolved issue.)\n\n\u2022 Automation Research Lab  \n  Consists of:\n  \u2013 A Lab unit configured to process automation\u2011science\u2011pack inputs.\n  (The lab remains unpowered and awaits integration into the electrical network.)\n\n\u2022 Electrical and Transport Infrastructure  \n  Consists of:\n  \u2013 Interconnected Electricity Groups linking poles across the network.\n  \u2013 Belt Groups and Pipe Groups providing material and fluid transfer.\n  (These networks continue to support operations without notable updates.)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement  \n  \u2013 Issue: The extra steam engine repeatedly fails to be placed due to severe congestion. The boiler at Position(8.0, 20.5) is crowded with misaligned burner\u2011inserters and overlapping transport belts, which completely obstruct the designated clearance near approximately Position(8.5, 22.5).\n  \u2013 Recommendation: Perform a thorough manual inspection of the boiler area and all adjacent connection interfaces. Remove or reposition interfering entities to clear the buildable space, or consider relocating the extra engine to a less congested zone.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Supply Management  \n  \u2013 Issue: Numerous burner\u2011inserters and mining drills are reporting \u201cout of fuel\u201d warnings.\n  \u2013 Recommendation: Establish a regular refueling routine and closely monitor fuel inventories (e.g., coal) to ensure uninterrupted operation.\n\n\u2022 Connection and Fluid Input for Steam Engines  \n  \u2013 Issue: Multiple steam engines present warnings such as \u201cnot connected to power network,\u201d \u201cno input liquid,\u201d and \u201cno fluid present in connections.\u201d\n  \u2013 Recommendation: Verify that each steam engine\u2019s electrical and fluid connection points are properly aligned with the boiler and the pipe network. Recheck the configuration of power and fluid systems to secure proper delivery.\n\n\u2022 Lab Power Deficiency  \n  \u2013 Issue: The Automation Research Lab remains without power.\n  \u2013 Recommendation: Reassess the lab\u2019s integration with the main electrical network and connect it appropriately to supply the necessary energy.\n\n(No custom utility functions have been defined by the agent.)\n"}
