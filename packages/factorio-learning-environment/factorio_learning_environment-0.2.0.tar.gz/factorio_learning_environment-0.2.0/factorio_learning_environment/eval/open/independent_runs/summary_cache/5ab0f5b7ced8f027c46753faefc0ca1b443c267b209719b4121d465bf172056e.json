Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed.\n\n### Errors in Managing Storage for Coal\n- Verify that storage chests are not full before attempting to extract or transfer items. Ensure there is sufficient space in the destination chest.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Monitor inventory levels to prevent it from becoming full. Transfer excess items to storage chests to free up space for further harvesting or crafting activities.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Operations\n- Ensure all required materials are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. Double-check crafting commands for any syntax or logical errors.\n\n### Errors with Extracting from Chests\n- Confirm that the chest is not empty before attempting to extract items. Ensure the correct chest and item type are being targeted for extraction."}
