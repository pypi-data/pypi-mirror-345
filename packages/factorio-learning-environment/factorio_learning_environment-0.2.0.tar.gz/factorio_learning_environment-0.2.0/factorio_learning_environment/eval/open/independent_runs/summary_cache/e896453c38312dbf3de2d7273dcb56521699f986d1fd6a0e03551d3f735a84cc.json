Check the connections to electric poles and ensure they are powered.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to missing entities\n- Verify the existence of required entities (e.g., offshore pumps) before attempting to connect or interact with them. If an entity cannot be found, check the surrounding area for its location."}
