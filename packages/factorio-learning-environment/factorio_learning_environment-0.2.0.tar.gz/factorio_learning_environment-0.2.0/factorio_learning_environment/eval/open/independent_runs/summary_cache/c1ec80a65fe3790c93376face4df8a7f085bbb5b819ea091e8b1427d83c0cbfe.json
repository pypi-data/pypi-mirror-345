{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (17.5, 20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', indicating it is not connected properly.\n- **Boiler** at position (1.5, 23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel', indicating it requires fuel to operate.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) is working and supplying water, connected via pipes.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting various positions, ensuring the flow of water from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at various positions, indicating the setup for electricity distribution, though currently showing a voltage of 0, suggesting no power is being generated.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Connections\n- Ensure all fluid connections are properly established between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to avoid warnings like 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'. Check all pipes and connection points.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers to prevent the 'out of fuel' status, which halts steam production and electricity generation.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Generation\n- Verify that the steam engine is correctly connected to the electricity poles and that all components are functioning to generate power. The current setup shows a voltage of 0, indicating no power is being distributed."}
