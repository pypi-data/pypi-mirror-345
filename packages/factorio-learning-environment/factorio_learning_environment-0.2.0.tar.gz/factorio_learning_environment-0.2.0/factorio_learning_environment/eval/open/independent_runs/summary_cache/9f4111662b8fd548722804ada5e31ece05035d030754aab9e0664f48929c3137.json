{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests have enough capacity before continuing mining or smelting operations. Empty full chests to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- Regularly check and clear the drop position of the mining drill to ensure continuous operation.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron_ore`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n  - `iron_gear_wheel`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n\nThis report provides a summary of the current structures and operational errors observed in the recent steps."}
