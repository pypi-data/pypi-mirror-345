{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts were made to create a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs and supporting research, but all placement and crafting attempts failed. There are no built structures recorded from these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API misuse in get_entities calls \u2013 Avoid using unexpected keyword parameters (e.g. 'radius') or extra positional arguments. Verify the correct function signature before calling.\n\u2022 Iteration over a None value \u2013 Ensure that the return value from get_entities is validated (or defaulted to an empty list) prior to any iteration.\n\u2022 Lab crafting failures \u2013 Insufficient sub-ingredients (such as iron-plate leading to missing iron-gear-wheel, copper-plate leading to inadequate copper-cable, or a shortage of iron-gear-wheel) prevent successful Lab creation. Confirm that all required resources and processing capabilities (e.g. furnaces or crafting machines) are in place before initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2022 Placement errors \u2013 Lab placement attempts fail when the Lab is not present in the inventory. Always verify inventory availability for placement operations before execution."}
