The agent has not successfully placed any entities or constructed any structures in the environment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chests\n- Ensure the target position for placing a Wooden Chest is buildable. The agent attempted to place Wooden Chests at several positions (e.g., x=0.0 y=0.0, x=5.0 y=5.0, x=10.0 y=10.0, etc.) that were not buildable.\n\n### Errors when placing Transport Belts\n- Confirm that the position for placing a Transport Belt is valid and unoccupied. The agent faced issues placing Transport Belts at positions such as x=0.0 y=0.0 and x=45.0 y=-85.0.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before attempting to place any entity, verify that the location is suitable and not restricted by global build settings or occupied by other entities. The agent encountered multiple placement errors due to unsuitable locations.\n\nThese tips should help in avoiding common placement errors and ensure successful construction of structures in the future."}
