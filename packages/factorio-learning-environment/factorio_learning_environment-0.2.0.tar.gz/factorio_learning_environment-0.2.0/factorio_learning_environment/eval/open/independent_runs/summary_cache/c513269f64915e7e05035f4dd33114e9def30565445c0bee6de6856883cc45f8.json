{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (x=1-5, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- 3 stone furnaces at positions (1,1), (3,1), (5,1)\n- 3 burner inserters at positions (1.5,2.5), (3.5,2.5), (5.5,2.5)\n- 3 wooden chests at positions (1.5,3.5), (3.5,3.5), (5.5,3.5)\nCurrent status: Furnaces have coal but no ingredients to smelt. Chests contain iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (x=2-4.5, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- 2 stone furnaces at positions (2,7), (4,7)\n- 3 burner inserters at positions (2.5,8.5), (4.5,8.5), (3.5,9.5)\n- 2 wooden chests at positions (2.5,9.5), (4.5,9.5)\n- Transport belt connecting furnaces (x=2.5-4.5, y=8.5)\nCurrent status: Furnaces have coal but no ingredients. One chest contains 47 copper plates.\n\n### Power Generation System (x=2.5-13.5, y=35.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (2.5,35.5)\n- Boiler at (7.0,35.5)\n- Steam engine at (13.5,35.5)\n- Pipe network connecting components\nCurrent status: System is working, generating electricity\n\n### Manufacturing Area (x=14.5-21.5, y=11.5-15.5)\nConsists of:\n- Copper cable assembling machine at (14.5,14.5)\n- Electronic circuit assembling machine at (21.5,15.5)\n- Multiple wooden chests and burner inserters for input/output\n- Electric pole network connecting machines\nCurrent status: Both machines lacking ingredients\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups connecting various production areas:\n- Belt system at y=8.5-9.5 for material transport\n- Vertical belt system from y=9.5 to y=16.5\n- Belt system connecting to manufacturing area\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing inserters or other entities, check if the target position is already occupied\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, ensure proper spacing and direction parameters\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure proper fuel supply to boilers\n- Set up consistent material flow to assembling machines to avoid ingredient shortages\n\n### Connection Issues\n- When setting up fluid systems, ensure all components are properly connected with pipes\n- Verify electrical connections between power consumers and the power grid"}
