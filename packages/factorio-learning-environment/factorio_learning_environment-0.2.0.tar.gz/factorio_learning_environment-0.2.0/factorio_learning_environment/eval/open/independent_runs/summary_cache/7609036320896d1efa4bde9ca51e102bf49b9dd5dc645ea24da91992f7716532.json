{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the execution logs provided:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System at (-82.0, -84.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for intermediate coal storage\n\n### Coal Transport System at (-80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two transport belts at (42.5, -80.5) and (43.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5) moving coal from wooden chest to belt\n- Burner inserter at (43.5, -81.5) moving coal from belt to furnace\n\n### Smelting Area at (-81.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other objects\n- When placing transport belts or inserters, ensure there's enough space between existing structures\n- Consider the full footprint of entities (especially multi-tile entities like furnaces) when planning placement\n\n### Entity Pickup Errors\n- Verify entity existence before attempting to pick up\n- Double-check coordinates when trying to interact with entities\n- Use proper entity type checking before operations\n\n### Transport System Design\n- Plan belt layouts considering the entire path from source to destination\n- Leave adequate space between components for inserters and additional belts\n- Consider using underground belts to bypass obstacles when regular belts cannot be placed\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  Success: Returns placed entity\n  Failure: Throws exception when placement location is blocked\n\nVariables:\n- transport-belt: 44 (inventory count)\n- burner-inserter: 1-3 (inventory count, varies)\n- coal: ~2300 (inventory count)\n- iron-plate: 340 (inventory count)\n\nEntity States:\n- Mining drill: Working state with coal fuel\n- Coal chest: Normal state, storing coal\n- Furnaces: NO_INGREDIENTS state, with coal fuel\n- Inserters: Various states (WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS)"}
