{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone brick production at position (-50.0, 0.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (-50.0, 0.0) facing RIGHT mining stone\n- Stone furnace at (-45.0, 0.0) smelting stone bricks\n- Burner inserter at (-47.5, 0.5) moving stone from belts to furnace\n- Transport belt at (-48.5, 0.5) carrying stone from drill to inserter\n- Output system added:\n  - Burner inserter at (-49.5, 3.5) moving bricks to chest\n  - Wooden chest at (-49.5, 4.5) for brick storage\n\nCurrent status:\n- Drill operational but output path issues persist\n- Furnace now has output system but still no production\n- Input inserter waiting for source items\n- Output inserter waiting for source items\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent belt placement errors\n- Repeated failures placing belts at (-48.0, 0.0) and (-49.0, 0.0)\n- Causes:\n  - Existing entities blocking placement\n  - Unverified placement positions\n- Solutions:\n  - Implement pre-placement checks with can_place_entity()\n  - Clear obstructions before placement attempts\n  - Maintain spatial map of existing entities\n\n#### Inserter placement issues\n- Failed placement at (-50.0, 1.0) due to obstruction/water\n- Always:\n  - Verify inserter placement positions are clear\n  - Check terrain suitability (avoid water tiles)\n  - Ensure proper spacing between entities\n\n#### Fuel management problems\n- Failed to insert coal into drill due to:\n  - Incorrect target entity reference\n  - No valid fuel insertion path\n- Solutions:\n  - Verify target entity accepts fuel before insertion\n  - Ensure proper inserter setup for fuel supply\n  - Maintain coal supply chain for burner entities\n\n#### Production chain analysis\n- System still not producing due to:\n  - Drill output path issues\n  - Missing belt connections\n  - Input material starvation\n- Critical fixes needed:\n  - Complete belt connections from drill to furnace\n  - Verify inserter orientations and positions\n  - Ensure coal supply for all burner entities\n\n#### Status monitoring failures\n- Persistent warnings:\n  - \"inserter waiting for source items\" (both inserters)\n  - Furnace remains empty\n- Must:\n  - Address all status warnings systematically\n  - Verify material flow at each production stage\n  - Implement status monitoring checks\n\n#### Repetitive error patterns\n- Same placement errors repeated multiple times\n- Need to:\n  - Implement error logging and analysis\n  - Break retry loops with condition checks\n  - Develop placement validation routines\n\n#### Throughput issues\n- Current production: 11 bricks/60s (suboptimal)\n- Bottlenecks:\n  - Incomplete material flow\n  - Fuel supply inconsistencies\n  - Entity positioning problems"}
