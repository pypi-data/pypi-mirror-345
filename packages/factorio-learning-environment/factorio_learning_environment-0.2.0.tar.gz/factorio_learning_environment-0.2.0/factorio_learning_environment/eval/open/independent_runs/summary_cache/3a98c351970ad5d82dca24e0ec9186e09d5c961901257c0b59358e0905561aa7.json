{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Smelting Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -82.0) that smelts ores.\n\u2022 Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) facing UP, transferring output from the furnace.\n\u2022 Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -84.5) receiving smelted items.\n\u2022 Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5) (present as an additional storage unit).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Missing or insufficient sub-ingredients \u2013 Repeated failures in crafting items (e.g., iron-gear-wheel, automation-science-pack, electronic-circuit, lab) are due to missing intermediate products like iron-plate, copper-plate, or copper-cable. Ensure that the required smelting or crafting setup is complete and ingredients are adequately supplied before initiating complex recipes.\n\u2022 Unresearched technology \u2013 Errors such as failing to craft assembling-machine-1 indicate that the necessary technology (automation) has not been unlocked. Verify technology prerequisites and conduct research before attempting related crafts.\n\u2022 Inventory and placement mismatches \u2013 Errors including failed lab placement (\"No lab in inventory\") and insertion errors (e.g., \"No copper-plate to insert from your inventory\") require confirming that the correct items are available and that target locations are ready for insertion. Double-check inventory and validate the readiness and existence of entities prior to placement or insert_item operations."}
