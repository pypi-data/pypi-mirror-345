{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore, currently containing 768 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is fueled with coal and has a pickup position at (-14.5, -45.5) and a drop position at (-14.5, -47.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source (chest) and destination (furnace) entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring items.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary to avoid collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources in the inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. Lack of resources can cause insertion failures."}
