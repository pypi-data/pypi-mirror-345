{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row mining iron ore:\n- First drill at (-10, -59) with wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Second drill at (-8, -59) with wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Third drill at (-6, -59) with drop position at (-5.5, -57.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- 4 stone furnaces in a row at positions (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0)\n- Input inserter line:\n  - 4 burner inserters at (0.5,-1.5), (2.5,-1.5), (4.5,-1.5), and (6.5,-1.5)\n  - 4 wooden chests for coal at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), and (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output handling:\n  - 4 wooden chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,1.5), (4.5,1.5), and (6.5,1.5)\n  - Burner inserter at (0.5,1.5) moving items from first furnace to chest\n  - Side-loading burner inserter at (7.5,0.5) moving items from last furnace\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Ensure target position is clear before placing new entities\n- When replacing entities, remove the old entity first\n- Double check exact coordinates match the intended drop positions\n\n### Resource handling issues\n- Mining drills need appropriate output containers (chest/furnace) at their drop positions to function properly\n- Ensure you have the required items in inventory before attempting to place them\n\n### Entity status issues \n- Keep mining drills fueled to maintain operation\n- Monitor for \"output blocked\" warnings which indicate missing or full output containers\n- Ensure proper connections between entities to maintain production flow"}
