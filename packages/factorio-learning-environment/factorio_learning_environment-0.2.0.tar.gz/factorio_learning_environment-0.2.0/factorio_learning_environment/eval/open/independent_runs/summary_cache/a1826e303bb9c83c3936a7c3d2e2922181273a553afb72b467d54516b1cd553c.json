{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring items from the mining drill to Furnace 1.\n- **Storage Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) which stores iron plates transferred from Furnace 1.\n\n### Secondary Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) which is intended to smelt iron ore but currently has no ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items to transfer to Furnace 2.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Multiple Wooden Chests** at various positions (e.g., x=-14.5, y=-48.5; x=-15.5, y=-48.5; x=-7.5, y=-47.5) used for storing and transferring items.\n- **Burner Inserters** at various positions (e.g., x=-14.5, y=-47.5; x=-11.5, y=-45.5) for item transfer between chests and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that all entities are properly defined and initialized before attempting to interact with them. For example, the error \"Could not find entity at x=-11.5 y=-44.5: name 'Chest' is not defined\" suggests that the entity was not properly initialized.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage inventory space to prevent errors such as \"Failed to insert iron-plate into stone-furnace... Inventory is full.\" Ensure that there is enough space in the target inventory before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors with Local Variable Access\n- Avoid accessing local variables that are not yet associated with a value. The error \"UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'x' where it is not associated with a value\" indicates that the variable needs to be properly initialized before use.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to the required source items to prevent them from waiting indefinitely. This can be achieved by ensuring a steady supply of items to the source position of the inserter.\n\n### Errors with Empty Ore Chests\n- Ensure that ore chests are regularly refilled to avoid errors like \"No iron ore available in ore chest for transfer.\" This involves setting up a reliable supply chain to keep the chests stocked."}
