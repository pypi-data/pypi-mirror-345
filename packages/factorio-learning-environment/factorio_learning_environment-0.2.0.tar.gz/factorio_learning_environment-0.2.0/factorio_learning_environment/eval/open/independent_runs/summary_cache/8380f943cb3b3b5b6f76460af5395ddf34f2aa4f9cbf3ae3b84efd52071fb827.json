{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. All attempts to place entities such as Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts have failed due to various placement errors. Consequently, there are no structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable terrain\n- Ensure that the terrain is suitable for building before attempting to place any entity. Check if the position is buildable for the specific entity type.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you intend to place. Attempting to place an entity on an already occupied tile will result in failure.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operation\n- Ensure that necessary resources, such as coal for Furnaces, are available and supplied to the entities to avoid operational failures.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the initial position\n- Make sure to move closer to the intended build location before attempting to place entities. Placing entities from a distance can lead to errors if the area is not properly surveyed.\n\n### General placement failures\n- Double-check the environmental settings and any global build restrictions that might be preventing successful placement of entities."}
