{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 3.0)\n- Steam engine at position (1.5, 7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Burner inserter at position (-2.5, 3.5) for feeding coal into the boiler\nThe system is operational and generating electricity for the factory, though the boiler occasionally runs out of fuel.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (15.5, -1.5) for coal collection\n- Burner inserter at position (15.5, -2.5)\n- Transport belt at position (15.5, -3.5)\nThis structure is mining coal and storing it in the wooden chest, which currently contains 175 coal.\n\n### Secondary Coal Mining Operation at Position (16.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 5.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 6.5) for coal collection\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 7.5)\nThis structure is mining coal and storing it in the wooden chest, which currently contains 79 coal. The inserter is waiting to output but has no valid destination.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at Position (15.5-24.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Four electric mining drills at positions (15.5, 70.5), (18.5, 70.5), (21.5, 70.5), and (24.5, 70.5)\n- Four wooden chests at positions (15.5, 72.5), (18.5, 72.5), (21.5, 72.5), and (24.5, 72.5) for ore collection\n- Transport belt network connecting the area\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nThe mining drills are now operational with electricity connected from the steam engine. The chests are full of iron ore which is being regularly extracted to feed the smelting facility.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (14.0-35.0, 76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Eight stone furnaces at positions (14.0, 76.0), (17.0, 76.0), (20.0, 76.0), (23.0, 76.0), (26.0, 76.0), (29.0, 76.0), (32.0, 76.0), and (35.0, 76.0)\n- Four wooden chests at positions (14.5, 79.5), (17.5, 79.5), (20.5, 79.5), and (23.5, 79.5) for iron plate collection\n- Eight burner inserters at positions (14.5, 78.5), (17.5, 78.5), (20.5, 78.5), (23.5, 78.5), (26.5, 78.5), (29.5, 78.5), (32.5, 78.5), and (35.5, 78.5) for extracting plates from furnaces\nThe furnaces are now actively smelting iron ore into iron plates. All furnaces have coal and iron ore, with the first four furnaces operating at full capacity.\n\n### Steel Production Facility at Position (14.0-17.0, 83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (14.0, 83.0) and (17.0, 83.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (14.5, 80.5) and (17.5, 80.5) for feeding iron plates into the steel furnaces\nThe furnaces are now actively producing steel plates from the iron plates being fed into them. Each furnace has a full inventory of iron plates and is producing steel at a steady rate.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting distant entities\n- Transport belts cannot connect entities that are too far apart"}
