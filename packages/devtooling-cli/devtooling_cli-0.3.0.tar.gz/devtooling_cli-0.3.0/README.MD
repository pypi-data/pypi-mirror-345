# Launch the interactive CLI

devtool

# Or if installed from source

python  -m  devtool

```

### Command Line Mode

*Structure Visualization*

```bash

# Show project structure with different modes

devtool  structure  --mode  MODE  PATH

# Examples:

devtool  structure  --mode  automatic  ./my-project

devtool  structure  --mode  manual  .

devtool  structure  --mode  complete  /path/to/project

```

```bash

# Add a folder to watch for projects

devtool  projects  --folders-add  PATH

# Add with low-level scanning (only root and first level)

devtool  projects  --folders-add  PATH  --low-level

# Remove a watched folder

devtool  projects  --folders-remove  PATH

## üìù Configuration

The tool will automatically detect your project type and apply appropriate filters. You can customize the detection rules by modifying:

```bash

#Define the rules to detect project types and their dependencies,
#and the files and directories to ignore based on the project type.

config/detection_rules.json

```
