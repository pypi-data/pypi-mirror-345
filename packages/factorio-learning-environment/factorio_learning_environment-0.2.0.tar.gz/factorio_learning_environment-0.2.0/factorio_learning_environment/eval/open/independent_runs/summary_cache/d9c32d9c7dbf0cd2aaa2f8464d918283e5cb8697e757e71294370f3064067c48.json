{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore and copper ore. (Current state: fuel remaining coal: 31, output available; continues to warn \u201cno ingredients to smelt\u201d.)\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects output from the furnace. (Note: The chest was replaced recently; inventory remains empty.)\n- Burner inserter at position (48.5, -81.5) that was replaced with a new extraction burner inserter. It is intended to supply items to a belt starting at drop position (49.5, -81.5), although subsequent belt connection and placement have encountered errors.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Connection Failures\n- When connecting structures such as belts, verify that all required entity properties (e.g., tile dimensions) are correctly defined before initiating connection operations. Confirm that objects used as connection references are not None.\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the required items before attempting placement. Specifically, validate availability of transport belts to avoid placement exceptions due to missing inventory.\n\n### Insertion and API Argument Consistency\n- Consistently check container inventories immediately after placement or replacement. Validate that the target container is active and accepting item insertions.\n- Maintain accurate entity references throughout transitions (e.g. picking up and replacing entities) to prevent conflicts and repeated assertion errors."}
