{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (9997 units available)\n- **Wooden Chests**\n  - Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) with inventory: Iron ore (8 units)\n  - Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) with empty inventory\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Warnings: Furnace result is full\n  - Status: Full output\n  - Furnace source: Iron ore (7 units)\n  - Furnace result: Iron plates (100 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Pickup position: (x=-14.5, y=-46.5)\n  - Drop position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Output in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace output is regularly cleared to prevent production halts. Consider adding more storage or using inserters to automate the transfer of iron plates from the furnace to a chest or conveyor belt.\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest at Mining Drill Drop Position\n- Regularly empty the chest at the mining drill's drop position to avoid mining interruptions. Consider using inserters to automate the transfer of mined resources to a storage area or directly to processing facilities.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Mining Drill\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to ensure continuous operation of the mining drill. Automate coal supply to the drill if possible to prevent manual refueling interruptions."}
