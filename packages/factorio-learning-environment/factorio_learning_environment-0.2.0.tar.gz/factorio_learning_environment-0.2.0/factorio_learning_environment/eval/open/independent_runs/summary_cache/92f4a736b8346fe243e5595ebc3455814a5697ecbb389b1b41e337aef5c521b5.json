{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. The agent has not successfully placed any entities as all placement attempts have failed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable positions\n- Ensure that the area is clear and buildable before attempting to place any entity. Verify the buildable status of a position using the game's API or visual indicators.\n\n### Errors when placing entities where another entity already exists\n- Check the target position for existing entities before attempting to place a new one. Use the game's API to query the map for existing entities at the desired location.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into non-existent or misplaced entities\n- Confirm that the target entity is correctly placed and within reach before attempting to insert items. Make sure the entity exists and is capable of accepting the items.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that the necessary resources are available in the inventory before attempting to supply entities with items like coal or iron ore. Regularly check inventory levels and plan resource collection accordingly.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without checking global build restrictions\n- Be aware of any global restrictions or rules that might prevent entity placement. Check for any such restrictions before attempting to place entities.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in constructing and managing structures within the game."}
