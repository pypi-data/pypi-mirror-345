{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with 2 coal and 45 iron ore as input, producing 100 iron plates. It has a warning indicating that the furnace result is full.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with 1 coal as fuel and a working status. It has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full, which is affecting its ability to continue mining.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing 332 iron ore.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing 661 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors related to insufficient coal for refueling:**\n  - Ensure that there is enough coal in the player inventory before attempting to refuel the Stone Furnace or any other coal-dependent entity.\n\n- **Warnings about full chests:**\n  - Regularly check the inventory of chests, especially those connected to mining drills, to ensure they are not full. Empty them as needed to allow continued operation of the mining drills.\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into full furnaces:**\n  - Monitor the output inventory of furnaces to avoid inserting items when the result inventory is full. \n\n- **Errors when extracting from entities:**\n  - Ensure that you are close enough to the entity from which you are extracting items to avoid execution errors related to distance.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `coal`: int (current amount of coal in inventory)\n  - `iron-ore`: int (current amount of iron ore in inventory)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (current amount of iron plates produced)"}
