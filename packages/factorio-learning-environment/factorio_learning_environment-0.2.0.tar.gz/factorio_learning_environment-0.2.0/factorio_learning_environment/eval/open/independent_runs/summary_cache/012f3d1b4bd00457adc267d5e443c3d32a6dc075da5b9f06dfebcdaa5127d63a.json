{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nThis structure is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore and consists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, currently working with iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the wooden chest to another burner inserter, consisting of belts from (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure there is enough space and the position is not occupied by another entity before placing a new entity. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to insert them into entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a transport belt. Belts cannot be connected directly to a chest.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required materials\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before attempting to craft an item. For example, wood must be gathered before crafting a wooden chest."}
