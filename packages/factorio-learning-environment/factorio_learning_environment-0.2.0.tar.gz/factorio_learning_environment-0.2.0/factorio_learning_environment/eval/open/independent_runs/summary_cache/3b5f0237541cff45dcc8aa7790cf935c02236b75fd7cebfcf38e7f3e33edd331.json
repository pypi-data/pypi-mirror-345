{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace.\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-8.5, -48.5) and (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) currently empty.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal and dropping it into a chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest to another chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the error at step 514 occurred due to attempting to insert coal without having any in the inventory.\n\n### Low Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of your mining drills and inserters. The coal drill at position (52.0, -82.0) repeatedly reported low fuel, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have the necessary items. Several inserters are in a waiting state due to lack of source items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Failed at step 514 due to lack of items in inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal_drill`: Represents the coal mining drill. Type: Entity.\n- `current_inventory`: Represents the agent's current inventory. Type: Dictionary with item names as keys and quantities as values."}
