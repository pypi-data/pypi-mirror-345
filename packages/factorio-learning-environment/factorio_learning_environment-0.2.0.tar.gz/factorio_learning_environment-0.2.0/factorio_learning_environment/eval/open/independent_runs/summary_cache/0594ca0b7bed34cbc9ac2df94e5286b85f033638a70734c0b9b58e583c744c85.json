Validate tile buildability prior to placement.\n  - When placing entities (e.g., the generator), ensure the player is within the maximum build range; move closer if the target position exceeds this range.\n\n\u2022 Entity Retrieval and Repositioning Errors:\n  - Avoid retrieving entities using outdated positions after repositioning; always reference their current location.\n  - Do not invoke properties as functions. For example, if a build area\u2019s center is provided as a Position object, access it without calling it to prevent TypeError.\n\n\u2022 Pipeline Connection Errors:\n  - Consistent failures in connecting the boiler to the generator arise from misaligned or blocked connection points. Verify that both source and target connection points are unobstructed and properly aligned.\n  - Searches for a working PipeGroup (e.g., fluid_system 170145) within range of the generator yield no candidates. Confirm that fluid_system identifiers match the current configuration and consider expanding or reinforcing the pipeline network.\n  - Both manual and alternative bridging methods fail when desired positions are unbuildable. Pre-validate target positions or adjust placement algorithms to improve success."}
