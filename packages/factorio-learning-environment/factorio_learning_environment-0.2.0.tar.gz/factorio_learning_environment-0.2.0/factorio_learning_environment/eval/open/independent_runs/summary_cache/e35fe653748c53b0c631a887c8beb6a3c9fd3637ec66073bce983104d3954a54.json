{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nThis structure is responsible for producing and transporting iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to an end wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free before placing an entity. If an entity already exists at the desired location, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in your inventory. For instance, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into a burner inserter.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to or from a chest. Use an inserter to transfer items between a chest and a belt.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without necessary raw materials\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before crafting. For example, wood must be collected manually as it is a raw resource and not craftable through recipes.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with incorrect spacing or direction\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure that the spacing and direction are correctly configured to avoid placement failures. Adjust these parameters as needed to fit the layout."}
