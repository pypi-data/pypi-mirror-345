{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Boiler (position not found, possibly missing)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe network connecting Offshore Pump to Steam Engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no fuel\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with coal but no ingredients\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with coal but no ingredients\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Lab Facility\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located within the electricity network but not powered\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, with some poles not connected to the power network\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups positioned across the map, some containing water and others empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities to Power Network\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network.\n- Verify that the connection path between entities is clear and that all necessary components (e.g., electric poles) are present and correctly positioned.\n\n### Errors when Accessing Entities by Position\n- Double-check the positions of entities before attempting to access them. Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position.\n- Use functions to verify the existence of entities at a position before performing operations on them.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Resources\n- Monitor your inventory levels and ensure you have enough resources before attempting to craft or place entities.\n\n### Errors with Fuel and Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have both fuel and the necessary ingredients to operate effectively.\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel and ingredient supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Verify that inserters are within the range of powered electric poles and that the power network is active and supplying electricity."}
