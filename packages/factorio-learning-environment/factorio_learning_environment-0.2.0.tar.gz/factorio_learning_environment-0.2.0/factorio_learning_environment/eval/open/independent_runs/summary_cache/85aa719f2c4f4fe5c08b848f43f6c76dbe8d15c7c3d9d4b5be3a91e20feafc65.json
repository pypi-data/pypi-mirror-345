{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5), extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0), processing the extracted iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid positions\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity before attempting to place it. This includes checking for obstructions and ensuring compatibility with the intended entity type.\n\n### NameError due to undefined variables\n- Verify that all variables are correctly defined and initialized before use. In the case of `ore_furnace`, ensure that the correct variable name is used and that it is properly initialized.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
