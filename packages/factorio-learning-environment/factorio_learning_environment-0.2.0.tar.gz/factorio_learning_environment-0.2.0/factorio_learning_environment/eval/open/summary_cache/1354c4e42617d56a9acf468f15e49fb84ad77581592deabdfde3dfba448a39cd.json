{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) (currently out of fuel)  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) (currently out of fuel and no ingredients to smelt)  \n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) (out of fuel, waiting for source items)  \n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) (out of fuel, waiting for space in destination, output blocked)  \n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) (out of fuel, waiting for source items)  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) (empty)  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) (not receiving electricity, no power)  \n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) forming an electricity group, but assembler still not powered  \n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, the burner entities are out of fuel, and the assembling machine is not receiving power despite electric poles being nearby and connected.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel insertion into burner entities  \n- Burner mining drills, furnaces, and burner inserters require fuel (coal) to operate. Ensure sufficient coal is inserted into these entities to keep them running.  \n- Avoid attempting to insert coal into burner inserters when the inventory is empty or coal is unavailable, as this causes insertion failures.  \n- Harvest coal proactively and maintain a coal stockpile in inventory to prevent fuel shortages.  \n\n### Errors due to assembling machine not receiving power despite electric poles nearby  \n- Electric poles must be properly connected in a power network that includes the assembling machine. Simply placing poles near the assembler does not guarantee power delivery.  \n- Verify that the electric poles are connected to a power source (e.g., steam engine or power grid).  \n- Check the assembler\u2019s connection points and ensure no gaps or missing connections exist between poles and the assembler.  \n- Confirm that the power poles themselves have energy and are not isolated from the main power network.  \n\n### Errors placing wooden chest not in inventory  \n- Before placing entities like wooden chests, confirm the required item is available in the inventory.  \n- Running out of wooden chests prevents placing output storage, causing production blockages.  \n\n### Errors inserting items when inventory is empty  \n- Attempting to insert items (e.g., coal) when the inventory is empty causes exceptions.  \n- Always check inventory contents before insertion attempts to avoid unnecessary errors.  \n\n### General placement and connection tips  \n- When connecting transport belts, inserters, and chests, ensure the destination entity exists and is accessible.  \n- Avoid output blockage by ensuring there is a valid sink entity (e.g., chest) to receive items from inserters.  \n- Maintain fuel supply chains and power networks continuously to prevent stoppages in production.  \n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
