{"content": "I notice the key issue now - we need to place a chest to collect the output from the mining drill. Looking at the warnings, it says \"waiting for space in destination as the output is full. Place a sink object at (-18.5, 21.5) to unblock.\"\n\nLet's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n# First place a chest for the output\nchest = place_entity(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    position=Position(x=-18.5, y=21.5)\n)\nprint(f\"Placed output chest at: {chest.position}\")\n\n# Now place the mining drill facing the chest\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=Position(x=-20.0, y=22.0),\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed mining drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Add coal to power the drill\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to mining drill\")\n\n# Check our setup\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\n\n# Verify the chest is collecting ore\ntime.sleep(5)  # Wait a few seconds\nchest_contents = inspect_entity(chest)\nprint(f\"Chest contents: {chest_contents}\")\n```\n\nKey lessons learned:\n1. Mining drills need an output location (chest or belt)\n2. The drill's position and direction matter - it needs to face its output\n3. The warning messages are helpful for debugging - they told us exactly what was missing\n4. We should check both the drill's status and the chest contents to verify it's working\n\nLet's try this revised approach with the proper output handling.", "summary_range": "[1-2634]"}
