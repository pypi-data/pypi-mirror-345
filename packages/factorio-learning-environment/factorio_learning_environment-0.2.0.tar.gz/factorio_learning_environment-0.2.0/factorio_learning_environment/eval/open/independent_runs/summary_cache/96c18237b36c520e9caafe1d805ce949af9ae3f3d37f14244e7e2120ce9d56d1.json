{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) for transferring items into the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) for extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) as an additional storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) for transferring items from the chest at position (56.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions for transporting coal and other resources.\n  - Belt from (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Belt from (49.5, -86.5) to (47.5, -86.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Belt from (43.5, -84.5) to (45.5, -84.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt from (45.5, -85.5) to (47.5, -85.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt from (52.5, -83.5) to (52.5, -85.5), direction UP.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Warnings about Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. For example, the chest at position (40.5, -82.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining operations."}
