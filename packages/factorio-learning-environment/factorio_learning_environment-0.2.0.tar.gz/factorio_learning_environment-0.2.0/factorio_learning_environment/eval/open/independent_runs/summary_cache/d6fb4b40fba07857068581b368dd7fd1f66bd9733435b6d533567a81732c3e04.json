{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine generates electricity using steam produced by the boiler, which is fueled by coal. The offshore pump supplies water to the boiler.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5). The lab is used for research purposes, specifically for automation science packs.\n\n### Pipe groups\n- PipeGroup for steam (fluid system 35159) at position(-18.5, 16.5).\n- PipeGroup for water (fluid system 35162) at position(-12.5, 21.5).\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 35165) at position(-9.5, 21.5).\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 35170) at position(-10.5, 22.5).\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 35171) at position(-6.5, 23.5).\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of small electric poles at positions (-16.5, 19.5), (-15.5, 19.5), and (-19.5, 22.5). This network provides power to the various structures in the vicinity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to boiler fuel\n- Ensure that the boiler has enough fuel before attempting to operate it. Regularly check the fuel inventory and insert coal as needed.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target location.\n\n### General tips for managing structures\n- Regularly monitor the status of all structures to ensure they are functioning correctly. This includes checking for sufficient resources and operational statuses."}
