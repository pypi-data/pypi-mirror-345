{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), each containing iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). The furnace at (-15.0, -48.0) is working, while the other two are out of fuel.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), containing various amounts of iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -52.5), (-3.5, -52.5), containing iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that the chests at drop positions are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from halting operations.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel furnaces to maintain continuous production. Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) are currently out of fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions were defined in the provided logs.\n\n- **Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore: int` - Represents the quantity of iron ore in inventory.\n  - `iron_plate: int` - Represents the quantity of iron plates in inventory.\n  - `iron_gear_wheel: int` - Represents the quantity of iron gear wheels in inventory.\n  - `wooden_chest: int` - Represents the count of wooden chests in inventory."}
