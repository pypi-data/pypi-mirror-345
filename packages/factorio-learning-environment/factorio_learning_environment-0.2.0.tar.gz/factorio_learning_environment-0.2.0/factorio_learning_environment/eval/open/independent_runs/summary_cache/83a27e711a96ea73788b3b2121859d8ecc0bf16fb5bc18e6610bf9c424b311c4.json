{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Wooden chest for coal collection (position x=23.5, y=-16.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Wooden chest for iron ore collection (position x=-14.5, y=21.5)\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Complex at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill for copper ore (position x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Collection chest for copper ore (position x=20.5, y=21.5)\n- Transfer chest for copper ore (position x=22.5, y=21.5)\n- Stone furnace for smelting (position x=24.0, y=20.0)\n- Output chest for copper plates (position x=24.5, y=17.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters forming a transport chain:\n  - Inserter at (x=21.5, y=21.5) moving items between chests\n  - Inserter at (x=22.5, y=20.5) feeding the furnace\n  - Inserter at (x=24.5, y=18.5) collecting finished plates\n  - Support inserters at (x=20.5, y=22.5) and (x=22.5, y=22.5)\n\n### Unused Smelting Setup\nTwo inactive stone furnaces at:\n- Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Position (x=-9.0, y=20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Always ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert fuel into entities\n- Check entity fuel levels regularly to prevent work stoppage\n\n### Entity Configuration Issues\n- When reconfiguring inserters, ensure both the pickup and drop positions are correctly set\n- Verify inserter facing direction matches the intended material flow\n- Make sure the entire production chain is properly connected and aligned\n\n### Resource Flow Issues\n- Monitor chest contents to prevent overflow or starvation\n- Ensure proper connection between mining, storage, and processing facilities\n- Set up adequate buffer storage between production stages"}
