{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. All attempts to craft or position a Lab\u2014intended to support the supply of Automation Science Packs for research\u2014have failed due to missing inventory items and insufficient sub-ingredients. Although existing furnaces were referenced for smelting operations, no production facility structure was newly established.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval:\n  - Verify the correct signature for get_entities. An incorrect use of a keyword argument (\u2018radius\u2019) and later passing positional arguments both caused TypeErrors.\n  \n\u2022 Structure Placement:\n  - Confirm that the required item (e.g., Lab) is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  \n\u2022 Handling Iterable Results:\n  - Check that returned values are not None before iterating over them to avoid iteration errors.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting and Resource Dependencies:\n  - Ensure that all sub-ingredients for a complex item (such as a Lab) are available. Shortages in items like iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables have led to crafting failures.\n  \n\u2022 Resource Chain Management:\n  - Monitor and preemptively process necessary resources so that production chains for sub-ingredients remain uninterrupted and dependencies are met."}
