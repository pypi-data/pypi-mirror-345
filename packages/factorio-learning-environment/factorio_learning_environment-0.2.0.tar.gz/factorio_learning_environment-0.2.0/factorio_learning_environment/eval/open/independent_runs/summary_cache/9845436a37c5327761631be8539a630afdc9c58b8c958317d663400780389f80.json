{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) connected to a transport belt system.\n- Transport Belts positioned from (41.5, -85.5) to (41.5, -82.5) and from (41.5, -80.5) to (41.5, -82.5) facilitating the movement of mined resources.\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5) transferring items from the transport belt to a wooden chest at position (40.5, -81.5).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -81.5) and (42.5, -80.5) for storage of items.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5) and outputs from (49.5, -86.5) to (47.5, -86.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (54.5, -86.5) to (52.5, -86.5) and outputs from (52.5, -82.5) to (53.5, -83.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (41.5, -85.5) to (41.5, -83.5) and outputs from (41.5, -83.5) to (41.5, -81.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (42.5, -84.5) to (44.5, -84.5) and outputs from (43.5, -84.5) to (45.5, -84.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (44.5, -82.5) to (42.5, -82.5) and outputs from (43.5, -82.5) to (42.5, -83.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (44.5, -83.5) to (44.5, -81.5) and outputs from (44.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -80.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (47.5, -82.5) to (49.5, -82.5) and outputs from (49.5, -83.5) to (49.5, -85.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Orientation\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly oriented to drop items into the intended target. Repeated rotations of the inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) indicate potential misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Outputs\n- The Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) is experiencing output blockage due to items on the ground and lack of a sink entity. Ensure that there is a clear path for mined resources to be transported away from the drill.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- The Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5) is unable to transfer items because the chest is full. Regularly check and clear storage entities to prevent bottlenecks in production.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients\n- The Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) is lacking ingredients to smelt. Ensure a consistent supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency."}
