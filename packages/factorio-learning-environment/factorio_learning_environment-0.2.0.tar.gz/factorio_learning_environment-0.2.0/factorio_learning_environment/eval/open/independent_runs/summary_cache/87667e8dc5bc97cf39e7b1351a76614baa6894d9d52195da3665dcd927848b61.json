{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-1.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler, with pipes at positions [(x=-8.5,y=23.5), (x=-9.5,y=23.5), (x=-6.5,y=23.5), ..., (x=-5.5,y=23.5), (x=-3.5,y=23.5), (x=-3.5,y=24.5)]\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine, with pipes at positions [(x=-0.5,y=22.5), (x=-1.5,y=22.5), (x=1.5,y=22.5), ..., (x=3.5,y=24.5), (x=5.5,y=24.5), (x=4.5,y=24.5)]\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace with coal fuel, positioned at (0.0, 0.0), currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Lab at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Lab with automation-science-pack input, currently has no power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Attribute Access\n- Ensure that attributes such as `tile_dimensions` are correctly accessed and exist in the entity's class definition. Verify the entity's class and ensure the attribute is available.\n\n### Type Conversion Errors\n- When converting attributes to a float, ensure the attribute is a string or a real number. Avoid using non-numeric attributes like 'ModelPrivateAttr' directly in type conversion.\n\n### Unsupported Operand Types\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that all operands are of compatible types. Avoid using non-numeric types like 'ModelPrivateAttr' in arithmetic expressions.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Before attempting to connect entities, ensure that the required items (e.g., pipes, electric poles) are available in the inventory. Craft or acquire necessary items beforehand.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Verify that all necessary components are available and correctly positioned to establish connections between entities, such as pipes or electric poles. Ensure that entities are within reach and properly aligned for connections.\n\n### Power Network Connection Issues\n- Ensure that generators, such as steam engines, are connected to the power network with appropriate electric poles. Verify that all necessary components are available and placed correctly to establish a power connection."}
