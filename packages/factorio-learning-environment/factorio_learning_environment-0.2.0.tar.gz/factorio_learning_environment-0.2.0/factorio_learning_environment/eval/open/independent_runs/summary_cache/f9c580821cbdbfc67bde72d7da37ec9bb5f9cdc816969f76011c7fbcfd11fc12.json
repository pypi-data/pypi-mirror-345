Check for existing objects or unsuitable terrain that may block pipe placement.\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Verify that the target location for placing pipes is clear of other objects and suitable for placement. Avoid attempting to place pipes on occupied tiles or unplaceable terrain such as water.\n\n### Errors in Establishing Electricity Connections\n- Ensure that all necessary connections are made between the steam engine and the electricity network using poles. Check for any missing connections that may prevent the electricity network from being established.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel boilers and burner mining drills to maintain continuous operation. Ensure coal is available and correctly distributed to all necessary entities."}
