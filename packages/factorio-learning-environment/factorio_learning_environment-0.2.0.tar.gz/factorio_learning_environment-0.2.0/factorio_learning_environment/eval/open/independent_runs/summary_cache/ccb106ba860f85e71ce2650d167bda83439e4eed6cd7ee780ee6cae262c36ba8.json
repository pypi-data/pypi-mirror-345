{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Status: Out of fuel\n  - Resources: 40,000 iron ore\n  - Drop position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Contains: 60 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. This includes checking for existing structures or items at the intended location.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract from non-existent entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to interact with actually exists at the specified position. This can be done by checking the map for the presence of the entity before attempting extraction or interaction.\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserters\n- Confirm that the desired location for placing a Burner Inserter is valid and unoccupied. Double-check the intended position to ensure there are no conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients or fuel\n- Regularly check the status of your entities to ensure they have the necessary ingredients or fuel to function. Keep an eye on warnings such as \"out of fuel\" or \"no ingredients to smelt\" and address them promptly by refueling or supplying the required materials."}
