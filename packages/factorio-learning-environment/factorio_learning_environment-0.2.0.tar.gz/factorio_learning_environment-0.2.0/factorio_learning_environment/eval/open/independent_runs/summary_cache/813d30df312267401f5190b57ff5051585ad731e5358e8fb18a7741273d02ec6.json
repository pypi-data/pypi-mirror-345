For example, 'Military' should be checked if it's a valid attribute.\n* Errors when researching a technology that is already researched:\n  - Check if a technology is already researched before attempting to research it again.\n* Errors when placing an entity too far away:\n  - Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n* Errors when an entity is not connected or has no input/output:\n  - Ensure that entities are properly connected and have the necessary inputs and outputs. For example, the steam engine was not connected and had no input liquid.\n* Errors when connecting transport belts directly from a chest or furnace:\n  - Add an inserter that takes items from the chest or furnace and use the inserter as a source entity.\n* Errors when getting an entity that does not exist at a specified position:\n  - Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to get it.\n* Errors due to incorrect operand type:\n  - Check the operand type before performing an operation. For example, ensure that the operand is not a 'ModelMetaclass' when using unary '-'.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at an occupied position:\n  - Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when attempting to connect entities with transport belts:\n  - Ensure that the source and target entities are valid for transport belt connections.\n* Errors when using incorrect argument types:\n  - Ensure that the correct argument types are used. For example, a Direction object should be used instead of an integer.\n* Errors when inserting items into an entity without having the required items in inventory:\n  - Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n* Errors when extracting items from an entity that does not contain the specified item:\n  - Ensure that the entity contains the specified item before attempting to extract it.\n* Errors when placing entities next to each other with insufficient spacing:\n  - Increase the spacing between entities or change the direction of placement to avoid collisions.\n* Errors when connecting entities with pipes:\n  - Ensure that the source and target entities are"}
