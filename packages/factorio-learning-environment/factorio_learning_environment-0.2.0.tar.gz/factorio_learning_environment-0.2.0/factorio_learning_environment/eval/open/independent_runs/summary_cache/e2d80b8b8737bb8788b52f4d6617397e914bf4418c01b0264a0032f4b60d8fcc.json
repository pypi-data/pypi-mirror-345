The maximum distance is 10 units.\n* Errors when inserting items into a furnace without having the required items in the inventory\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace.\n* Errors when connecting transport belts directly to a furnace\n  - Use an inserter to input items into the furnace and connect the transport belt to the inserter instead.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at a position that is already occupied\n  - Ensure the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction.\n* Errors when harvesting resources that are not within reach\n  - Move to the target resource patch before attempting to harvest.\n* Errors when placing an entity at a position where there is an existing object in the way\n  - Ensure there are no existing objects in the way before attempting to place a new entity.\n* Errors when attempting to craft items that require sub-ingredients that cannot be crafted\n  - Ensure that all required sub-ingredients can be crafted or are available in the inventory before attempting to craft the item.\n* Errors when attempting to connect transport belts directly from a furnace\n  - Add an inserter that takes items from the furnace and use the inserter as a source entity.\n* Errors when attempting to access the 'position' attribute of a 'Position' object\n  - Ensure that the object is not already a 'Position' object before attempting to access its 'position' attribute.\n* Errors when attempting to insert items into a furnace without the required fuel\n  - Ensure that the furnace has the required fuel before attempting to insert items.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity without having it in the inventory\n  - Ensure that the entity is in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n* Errors when attempting to insert an item into a furnace with an incorrect quantity\n  - Ensure that the quantity of the item being inserted is valid.\n* Errors when extracting items from a furnace with no items available\n  - Check the quantity of items in the furnace before attempting to extract.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
