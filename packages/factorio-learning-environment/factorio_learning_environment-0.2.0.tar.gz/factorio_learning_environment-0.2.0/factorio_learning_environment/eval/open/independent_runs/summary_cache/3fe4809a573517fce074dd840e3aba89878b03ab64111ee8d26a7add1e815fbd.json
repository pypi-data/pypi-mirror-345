{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED due to no input liquid.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status NO_FUEL, containing water and steam in its fluid box.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING, supplying water to the system.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) with status EMPTY, connecting various points.\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=-0.5, y=21.5) with status EMPTY.\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=2.5, y=21.5) with status EMPTY.\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, transporting water from the offshore pump.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles at various positions, including (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), and others, currently with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and within range. For example, the connection attempt from the boiler's steam output to the steam engine failed due to incompatible or misplaced entities.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- When using attributes from a class or module, ensure that the attribute names are correct. The error with `Prototype.PipeToGround` suggests a typo or incorrect attribute usage. Consider using `PipeGroup` instead if that is the correct attribute.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers to maintain their operation. The boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) was out of fuel, which can halt the electricity generation process.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: Used to connect entities such as pipes and engines. Ensure that the entities are correctly specified and exist in the game world to avoid connection errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: A collection of connected pipes, ensure correct initialization and usage to prevent connection issues.\n- `Prototype`: A class or module used for entity prototypes. Verify attribute names to avoid errors like `AttributeError`.\n\nThis report summarizes the current state of structures and provides guidance on addressing errors encountered during the gameplay."}
