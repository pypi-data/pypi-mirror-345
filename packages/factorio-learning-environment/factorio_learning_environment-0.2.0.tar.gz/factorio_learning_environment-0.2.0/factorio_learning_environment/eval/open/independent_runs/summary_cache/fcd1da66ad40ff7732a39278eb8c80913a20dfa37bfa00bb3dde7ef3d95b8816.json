{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5) - currently not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Lab at position(0, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (0, 1) - currently has no power and is waiting for automation science packs to complete research.\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0, 0) - has coal as fuel and is currently not smelting any ingredients.\n\n### Furnace at position(2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (2, 0) - has coal as fuel and is currently not smelting any ingredients.\n\n### Wooden chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) - currently empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric network connections\n- Ensure that electric poles are connected to the electric network by placing them within the range of other powered entities.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the lab\n- Check the inventory of the lab before attempting to insert items. If the lab's inventory is full, remove excess items or wait until space is available.\n\n### Errors when attempting to access entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at the specified position before trying to access it. If the entity does not exist, adjust your position or create the entity if necessary.\n\n### Errors related to building box dimensions\n- Ensure that the dimensions specified for building boxes match the prototype dimensions. Refer to the prototype documentation for accurate width and height values.\n\n### Repeated errors accessing the lab\n- The lab at position (0, 1) is not found. Confirm that the lab is placed correctly on the map and that you are referencing the correct coordinates."}
