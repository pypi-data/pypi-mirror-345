The error \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" indicates that the inventory was empty or did not contain the required items.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient coal\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a furnace. The error \"Not enough coal in inventory to insert into the furnace.\" indicates that there is not enough coal available.\n\n### Errors with LuaItemStack\n- Review the item insertion logic to ensure that the item stack is valid and that you have enough items to insert. The error \"Could not insert: LuaItemStack\" suggests that the insertion attempt failed due to an invalid state or insufficient items."}
