{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a status of 'out of fuel'.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with a status of 'out of fuel' and 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a status of 'out of fuel'.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) where the drill drops mined resources.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with a status of 'out of fuel' and 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) with a normal status.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or drills. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors Due to Fuel Shortages\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel, which causes them to stop functioning. Consider setting up a more automated refueling system to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Without the required materials, furnaces will not operate, leading to inefficiencies in production.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `copper_furnace`: Represents a furnace entity used for copper smelting.\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents a furnace entity used for iron smelting.\n  - `copper_mining_drill`: Represents a mining drill entity used for copper extraction.\n  - `iron_mining_drill`: Represents a mining drill entity used for iron extraction."}
