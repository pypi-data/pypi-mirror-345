{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for coal storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Item Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) transferring items from a Wooden Chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of coal and other items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is available in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place an assembling machine without having it in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Insufficient materials for crafting\n- Gather all necessary materials before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting an assembling machine requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and electronic circuits.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Regularly check and manage your inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can hinder resource collection and crafting activities. Transfer excess items to chests to free up space.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure that the target container has enough items to extract before attempting to extract. An error will occur if the container is empty or if the extraction quantity exceeds the available amount."}
