{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n\nThis structure is set up for the extraction and processing of iron ore into iron plates. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into the stone furnace for smelting. However, there are warnings indicating that the output of the mining drill is blocked and the furnace lacks ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, and Transport Belt at the desired location**: Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. Verify the positioning and clear any obstructions before attempting to place these entities.\n\n### Errors when Moving Entities\n- **Cannot move Stone Furnace to the desired location**: Double-check the destination tile to ensure it is suitable for the entity. Make sure there are no other entities occupying the space and that the tile is accessible.\n\n### Errors with Entity Interaction\n- **Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at specified position**: Ensure that the entity you are trying to interact with exists at the specified location. Verify the position coordinates and confirm the presence of the entity before attempting any operations.\n\n### Warnings Related to Entity Status\n- **Output blocked by item on the ground**: Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to receive the output from the mining drill. Clear any items obstructing the output path.\n- **No ingredients to smelt**: Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply chain to confirm that resources are being delivered to the furnace.\n\nBy addressing these errors and warnings, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be significantly improved."}
