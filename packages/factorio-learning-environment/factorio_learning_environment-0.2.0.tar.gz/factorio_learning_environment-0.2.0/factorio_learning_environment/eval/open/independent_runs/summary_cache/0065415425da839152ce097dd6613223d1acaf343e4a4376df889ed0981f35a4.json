{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities with fluid system 3364, status: FULL_OUTPUT\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-82.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-82.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at Position (x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation-science-pack, status: NO_RESEARCH_IN_PROGRESS\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs for coal transportation, status: WORKING\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between the boiler at (x=0.5, y=28.0) and the steam engine at (x=7.5, y=39.5) are correctly aligned and connected. Check for any missing or misplaced pipes.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure that you have the required entities in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, ensure burner mining drills are available in inventory before placement.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items\n- Before crafting, verify that all required sub-ingredients are available in the inventory. For example, ensure stone is gathered before crafting stone furnaces, which are required for burner mining drills.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map."}
