{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for the extraction and processing of iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5), used for temporary storage of extracted iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), used for temporary storage of extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0), fueled by coal, converting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5), storing the produced iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to the storage chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n\n### Errors when using unexpected keyword arguments\n- Verify the function signatures and ensure that only supported arguments are used when calling functions or methods. Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments like 'position' if they are not supported.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has available items for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and maintain the supply of items to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate items being inserted. Regularly manage inventory space to prevent blockages."}
