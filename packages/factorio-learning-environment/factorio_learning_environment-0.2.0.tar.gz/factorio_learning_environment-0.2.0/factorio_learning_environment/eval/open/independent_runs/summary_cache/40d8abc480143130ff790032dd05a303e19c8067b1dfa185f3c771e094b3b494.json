{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production System at position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (61.0, -54.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (62.5, -53.5) facing the furnace\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (63.5, -53.5) to collect iron plates\n\n#### Second Iron Plate Production System at position (65.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (65.0, -54.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (66.5, -53.5) facing the furnace\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (67.5, -53.5) to collect iron plates\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like wooden chests or inserters. For example, the agent tried to place a wooden chest without having one in inventory.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities without sufficient inventory\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to insert items into furnaces or inserters. The agent tried to insert iron ore and coal into entities without having the required items in inventory.\n\n#### Errors due to misconfigured inserters\n- Ensure inserters are correctly rotated and fueled to face the correct direction (e.g., towards the furnace or chest). The agent had to remove and replace misconfigured inserters multiple times.\n\n#### Errors due to insufficient fuel or inputs in furnaces\n- Always ensure furnaces have both fuel and input materials (e.g., iron ore) to avoid smelting timeouts. The agent encountered a smelting timeout due to insufficient fuel or inputs.\n\n#### Errors when checking chest contents prematurely\n- Avoid checking chest contents before the production system has had time to generate items. The agent repeatedly checked for iron plates in the chest before they were produced.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing entities. The agent attempted to place a wooden chest on an occupied tile, which failed.\n\n#### Errors due to out-of-fuel inserters\n- Always ensure inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. The agent placed an inserter without adding fuel, causing it to stop functioning."}
