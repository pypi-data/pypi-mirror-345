{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5), currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (42.5, -83.5), (43.5, -83.5), and (44.5, -83.5) storing coal, with the chest at (40.5, -83.5) being full.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest at (40.5, -83.5), waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Stone Furnace Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5) intended to input coal into the furnace at (61.0, -54.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (65.5, -52.5) intended to input coal into the furnace at (64.0, -53.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) storing stone bricks, wood, coal, and stone.\n\n### Belt System\n- Transport Belt starting at position (43.5, -81.5) intended to connect to other entities but currently not successfully connected.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts to furnaces\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to a stone furnace. Use an inserter to input items into the furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear of other entities or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water) before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors in belt path normalization\n- Ensure that the path for connecting belts is valid and can be normalized. Check for obstacles or invalid paths that might disrupt the connection.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: Used to connect two entities with a transport belt. Ensure the entities are compatible for connection.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `belt_to_inserter_1`: Intended to connect a belt to an inserter, but faced issues due to incorrect connections.\n- `inserter_1_position`: Position variable for placing an inserter, encountered placement issues due to occupied tiles."}
