{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nComplex automated coal mining and transport system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Storage chest system:\n  - Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) storing 1600 coal\n  - Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) storing ~150 coal as buffer\n- Transport system:\n  - Chest inserter (x=42.5, y=-79.5) facing DOWN\n  - Transport belt (x=42.5, y=-80.5) moving RIGHT\n  - Furnace inserter (x=43.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Processing:\n  - Stone furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n  - Second stone furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n- Output storage:\n  - Wooden chest (x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Belt Transport System\n- Belt group running from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5 along x=42.5\n- Connected to main processing area via belt at (x=42.5, y=-80.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Multiple attempts to place inserters failed due to existing objects\n- Always check if target location is clear before placing entities\n- Use position verification before placement attempts\n\n2. Inserter Positioning Issues\n- Several iterations were needed to find optimal inserter positions\n- Consider planning inserter placement carefully to avoid multiple repositioning\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended workflow\n\n3. System Design Issues\n- Multiple attempts to optimize coal transport system indicate suboptimal initial design\n- Plan complete system layout before construction to avoid repeated adjustments\n- Consider space requirements for all components in initial design\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- coal_chest: Chest\n- furnace: Furnace\n- belt: Belt/BeltGroup\n\nSystem States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Waiting for input\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Output blocked\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Missing required materials"}
