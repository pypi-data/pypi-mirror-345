{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Complex\nMultiple furnace setups for smelting iron ore:\n- Furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) with burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) and wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n### Automation Science Pack Factory\nLocated around (24.5, 4.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine-1 at (24.5, 4.5)\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 4.5) containing iron plates\n- Output wooden chest at (27.5, 4.5) storing automation science packs\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - At (22.5, 4.5) moving items from input chest to assembler\n  - At (26.5, 4.5) moving items from assembler to output chest\n- Multiple electric poles for power distribution\n\n### Power Generation System\nSteam power setup:\n- Steam engine at (9.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.0, 23.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipe network for water and steam distribution\n- Electric pole network connecting various structures\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Pipe Connection Errors\n- When connecting pipes between boiler and steam engine, ensure there is a valid path between them\n- Verify that the connection points are within reach and aligned correctly\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Cannot mix different ore types in the same furnace (e.g., trying to insert iron ore into a furnace containing copper ore)\n- Clear the furnace of existing ore before attempting to insert a different type\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Monitor coal levels closely to prevent \"NO_FUEL\" states in boilers and other fuel-consuming entities\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available before attempting to insert fuel into machines\n\n### Entity Connection Errors\n- When connecting different types of entities (like UndergroundPipe and Pipe), ensure they are compatible and properly aligned\n- Check that the connection points are valid and within range"}
