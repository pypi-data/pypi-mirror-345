{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Although the agent made repeated attempts to supply and craft a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5), none of these attempts resulted in a successfully placed Lab. Operations involving furnaces for smelting (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper) used pre\u2010existing equipment; the overall state remains that no new structures have been created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect use of get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid supplying unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u2018radius\u2019) or extra positional arguments. Verify the function\u2019s signature before calling it.\n\u2022 Lab placement without available inventory:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure the Lab item is present in inventory before attempting to place it.\n\u2022 Iterating over a None value:\n\u2003\u2013 Check that the result from functions like get_entities is not None (fallback to an empty list) prior to iterating.\n\u2022 Insufficient ingredients during Lab crafting:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all intermediate components (e.g., iron-plates for iron-gear-wheel production and copper-plates/copper-cables for electronic-circuit production) are available and that the necessary production setups (such as furnaces or crafting machines) are operational before attempting to craft a Lab."}
