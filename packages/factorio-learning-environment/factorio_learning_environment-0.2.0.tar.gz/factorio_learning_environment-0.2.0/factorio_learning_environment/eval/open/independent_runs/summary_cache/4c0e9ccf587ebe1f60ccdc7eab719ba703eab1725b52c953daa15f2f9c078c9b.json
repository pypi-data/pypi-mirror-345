{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=4.0) with coal (refilled with 50 coal in steps 34, 38, and 45)\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole (x=1.5, y=7.5)\n\nThe system is working and producing power for the factory, generating approximately 388-396 steam per minute.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (x=18.5, y=73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=18.5, y=73.5) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest (x=18.5, y=75.5) collecting iron ore from the drill\n- Stone furnace (x=19.0, y=77.0) with 38 coal\n- Inserter (x=19.5, y=78.5) to move iron plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest (x=19.5, y=79.5) for iron plate storage\n- Chest output inserter (x=19.5, y=80.5) to extract plates from chest\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=19.5, y=81.5) with belts extending to (x=14.5, y=78.5)\n- Additional belt system from (x=8.5, y=75.5) to (x=9.5, y=77.5) connecting to the circuit assembly\n- Small electric poles (x=21.5, y=73.5), (x=20.5, y=75.5), (x=21.5, y=78.5), (x=21.5, y=80.5)\n\nThe system is now working, with the drill producing iron ore at a rate of approximately 42 ore per minute. The iron ore is being stored in the chest, which has accumulated over 150 iron ore. The furnace is now working when manually fed with ore.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (x=-48.5, y=78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=-48.5, y=78.5) mining copper ore\n- Wooden chest (x=-48.5, y=80.5) collecting copper ore from the drill\n- Stone furnace (x=-48.0, y=82.0) with 38 coal\n- Inserter (x=-47.5, y=83.5) to move copper plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest (x=-47.5, y=84.5) for copper plate storage\n- Chest output inserter (x=-47.5, y=85.5) to extract plates from chest\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=-47.5, y=86.5) extending to (x=-22.5, y=86.5)\n- Small electric poles (x=-45.5, y=78.5), (x=-46.5, y=80.5), (x=-45.5, y=83.5), (x=-45.5, y=85.5)\n\nThe system is now working, with the drill producing copper ore at a rate of approximately 42 ore per minute. The copper ore is being stored in the chest, which has accumulated over 150 copper ore. The furnace is now working when manually fed with ore.\n\n### Circuit Production System\nConsists of:\n\n#### Copper Cable Assembly (x=-6.5, y=74.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (x=-6.5, y=74.5) set to produce copper cables\n- Input inserter (x=-8.5, y=74.5) with pickup position (x=-9.5, y=74.5) and drop position (x=-7.5, y=74.5)\n- Output inserter (x=-4.5, y=74.5) with pickup position (x=-5.5, y=74.5) and drop position (x=-3.5, y=74.5)\n- Small electric pole (x=-6.5, y=76.5)\n- Transport belt connecting to the output\n\n#### Electronic"}
