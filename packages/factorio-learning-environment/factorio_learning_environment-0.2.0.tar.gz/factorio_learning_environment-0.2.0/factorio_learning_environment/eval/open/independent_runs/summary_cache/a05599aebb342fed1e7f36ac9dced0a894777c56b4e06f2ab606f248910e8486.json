Currently has no ingredients to smelt but contains 37 iron plates.\n\n### Storage area near (-20.5, -49.5)\nConsists of multiple chests:\n- Wooden chest at (-25.5, -49.5) containing 3 iron chests and 750 coal.\n- Iron chest at (-26.5, -49.5) containing 282 coal, 5 stone and 1250 iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at (-20.5, -49.5) containing 40 wooden chests, 1 steel chest, 14 burner inserters, 2 burner mining drills, 2 stone furnaces, 4 wood and 500 coal.\n- Multiple empty iron chests at (-24.5, -49.5), (-23.5, -49.5), (-22.5, -49.5), (-21.5, -49.5), (-19.5, -49.5), (-18.5, -49.5).\n\n### Storage area near (-14.5, -49.5)\nConsists of multiple chests:\n- Steel chest at (-14.5, -66.5) containing 20 wooden chests, 1 steel chest, 11 transport belts, 127 coal, 298 iron ore, 30 copper ore, 764 iron plates, 21 copper plates, 4 copper cables and 1736 iron gear wheels.\n- Iron chest at (-14.5, -57.5) which is empty.\n- Steel chest at (-12.5, -49.5) containing 25 iron ore.\n- Iron chest at (-11.5, -49.5) which is empty.\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, -47.5) which is empty.\n- Iron chests at (-14.5, -46.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-14.5, -43.5), (-14.5, -42.5) which are empty.\n- Wooden chests at (-14.5, -38.5), (-13.5, -39.5) which are empty.\n- Steel chest at (-14.5, -34.5) which is empty.\n\n### Belt network\n- A belt network exists with segments at (37.5, -83.5), (45.5, -83.5), (4.5, -73.5), (-15.5, -55.5), (-17.5, -51.5), (-7.5, -48.5).\n- One segment at (45.5, -83.5) contains 1 coal and is working.\n- One segment at (-17.5, -51.5) contains 10 iron ore and is working.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory full when crafting\n- The agent is repeatedly failing to craft transport belts due to a full inventory when trying to craft iron gear wheels, a sub-component of transport belts.\n- Clear out inventory space before attempting to craft items, or craft items that use the materials in the inventory.\n\n### Could not extract\n- The agent is failing to extract items from chests and mining drills.\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n- Ensure that the item you are trying to extract actually exists in the source inventory.\n- Ensure that there is space in the agent's inventory to receive the extracted"}
