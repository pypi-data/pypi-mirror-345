{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the connected chest. Currently has a status of `NO_FUEL`.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill. Contains 186 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Currently has a status of `WORKING` but has experienced frequent misalignment issues.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently has a status of `NO_INGREDIENTS` due to not receiving iron ore from the inserter.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5): Designed to transfer iron plates from the stone furnace to another location. Currently has a status of `WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the intended source and target entities. Frequent repositioning indicates a need for careful alignment checks.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the burner mining drill and burner inserters to prevent interruptions in operation. Ensure sufficient coal or other fuel types are available in inventory to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter transferring items to the furnace is correctly aligned and operational. Ensure that the furnace has a clear path to receive iron ore from the inserter.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to pick up. If not, investigate the supply chain to ensure continuous item flow.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Address warnings related to entities running out of fuel promptly to avoid operational downtime. Consider setting up automated refueling mechanisms if possible."}
