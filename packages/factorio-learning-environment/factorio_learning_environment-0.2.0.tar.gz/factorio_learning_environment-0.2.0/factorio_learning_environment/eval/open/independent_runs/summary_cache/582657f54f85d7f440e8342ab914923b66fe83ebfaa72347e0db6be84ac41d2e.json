Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or modifying the reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and manage inventory levels in source entities to prevent inserters from idling."}
