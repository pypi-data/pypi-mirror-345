{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5)\n- Iron Chests at positions (-6.5, -50.5), (-5.5, -50.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or mining drills. This will prevent errors related to \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. Specifically, the chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining operations effectively.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int) -> Entity`: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It failed when there was insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory: dict[str, int]`: Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wood', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
