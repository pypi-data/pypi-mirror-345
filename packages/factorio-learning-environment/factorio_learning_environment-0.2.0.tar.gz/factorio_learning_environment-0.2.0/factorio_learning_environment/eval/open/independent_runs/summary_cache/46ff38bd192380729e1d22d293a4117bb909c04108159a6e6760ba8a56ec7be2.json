{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-16.5, -52.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n    - Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (40,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (7 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (18 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Inventory: Iron plate (6 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Ensure there is a clear, unoccupied space at the target location before attempting to place a burner inserter. Check for existing objects or unplaceable terrain such as water.\n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For instance, the variable `chest_inserter` was not defined. Double-check variable names and ensure they are initialized correctly.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Use an inserter to connect entities like a wooden chest to a belt. Direct connections are not possible.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to insert it into a mining drill."}
