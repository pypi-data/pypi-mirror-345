{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) for smelting copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting iron plates\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storing items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace or drill without having coal in the inventory results in an error.\n\n### Errors When Structures Run Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of your mining drills and furnaces. Replenish fuel before it runs out to maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure the item exists in the inventory before calling this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity.\n- `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n- `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n\nThese variables are used to manage and interact with the respective entities on the map."}
