{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to a stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Placement\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing entities when placing inserters. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Check the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they are set correctly.\n\n### Refueling and Resource Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Ensure coal or other fuel sources are adequately distributed to all operational entities."}
