"""
This file contains a test case for the 'change_issue_type' method of a client class.
It mocks the '_request' method to raise a 'ChangeIssueTypeError' exception and tests if the method correctly handles
the exception.
The test asserts that the expected error message is printed when the exception is raised.

Functions:
- test_change_issue_type_fails: Mocks the _request method to raise an exception when attempting to change the issue
type.
Args:
client (object): An object representing the client used to interact with the system.
capsys (object): An object used to capture stdout and stderr.
Exceptions:
ChangeIssueTypeError: Raised when the _request method encounters an issue while attempting to change the issue type.
