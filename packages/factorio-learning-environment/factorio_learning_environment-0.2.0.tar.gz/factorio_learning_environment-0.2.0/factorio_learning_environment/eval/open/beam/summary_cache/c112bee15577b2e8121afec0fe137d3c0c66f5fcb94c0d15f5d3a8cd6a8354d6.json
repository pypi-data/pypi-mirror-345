{"content": "The attempt to retrieve the recipe for the Electric Furnace has failed due to an incorrect reference to the prototype name. The error indicates that `PrototypeElectricFurnace` does not exist, which suggests that the correct prototype name needs to be identified.\n\n### Current Findings:\n1. **Invalid Prototype Reference**: The name used to reference the Electric Furnace is incorrect, leading to an `AttributeError`.\n2. **Need for Correct Prototype Identification**: I need to ensure that I am using the correct prototype name for the Electric Furnace.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Available Prototypes**: I will retrieve the list of available prototypes to identify the correct name for the Electric Furnace.\n2. **Retrieve the Correct Recipe**: Once the correct prototype name is identified, I will retrieve the recipe for the Electric Furnace and check its requirements.\n\nLet's proceed by listing the available prototypes to find the correct name for the Electric Furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Retrieve the list of available prototypes to find the correct name for the Electric Furnace\navailable_prototypes = get_prototypes()  # Function to list all available prototypes\n\n# Print out the available prototypes to identify the correct name for the Electric Furnace\nprint(f\"Available Prototypes: {available_prototypes}\")  # Display the list of available prototypes to find the Electric Furnace name.", "summary_range": "[1-404]"}
