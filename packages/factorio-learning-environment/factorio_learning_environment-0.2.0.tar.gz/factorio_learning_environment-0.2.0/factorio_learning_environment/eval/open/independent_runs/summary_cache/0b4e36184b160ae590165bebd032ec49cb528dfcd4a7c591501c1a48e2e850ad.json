Ensure that the required technology (automation technology) is researched before attempting to craft it.\n  \n- **Errors when using technology that doesn't exist**:\n  - Make sure to check the available technologies before attempting to access their progress or use them in crafting. The error indicates that the technology \"energy-shields\" does not exist.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `get_research_progress(tech)`: Invoked but failed due to a non-existent technology.\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AssemblingMachine1, quantity=1)`: Invoked but failed because the recipe is not unlocked yet.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `progress`: type `float` - stores the progress of the researched technology.\n  - `crafted_quantity_assembler`: type `int` - stores the quantity of Assembling Machines to craft."}
