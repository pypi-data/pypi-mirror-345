{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n- The furnace is continuously monitored for coal levels to ensure uninterrupted operations.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to storage.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5) and (42.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operation\n- Ensure that the inserter has a valid source item to pick up. The inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or misalignment. Verify the source and destination positions are correctly set and that there are items to be moved.\n\n### Furnace Output Blockage\n- The furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) has a warning indicating that the result is full. Regularly extract iron plates from the furnace to prevent production halts due to inventory overflow.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or important variables have been defined or invoked in the logs provided."}
