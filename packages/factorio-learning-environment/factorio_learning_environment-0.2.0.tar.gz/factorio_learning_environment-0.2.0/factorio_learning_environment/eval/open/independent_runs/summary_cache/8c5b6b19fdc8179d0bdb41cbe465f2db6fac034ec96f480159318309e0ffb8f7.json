{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the desired location for placing entities like Burner Inserters, Transport Belts, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests is not occupied by another entity. Check the tile before attempting to place an entity to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, the variable `ore_furnace` was not defined, leading to a `NameError`. Double-check variable names and ensure they are correctly initialized.\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For instance, attempting to insert coal into a burner mining drill without having coal in the inventory led to an exception.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that the output of entities like Burner Mining Drills is not blocked. Place a sink entity like a chest or conveyor belt to accept the output and prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of entities like Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces to ensure they are adequately fueled and operational."}
