{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: 6 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Transport Belt**: Ensure the target location is unoccupied before attempting to place a transport belt.\n- **Burner Inserter**: Verify that the desired location is free of other entities before placing a burner inserter.\n- **Wooden Chest**: Confirm that the intended placement area is clear of other objects before placing a wooden chest.\n- **Stone Furnace**: Check that the target location is available and that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to move or place a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors when Retrieving Entities\n- **Stone Furnace Retrieval**: Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the coordinates and entity type.\n\n### Errors due to Output Blockage\n- **Burner Mining Drill Output Blockage**: Make sure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### General Tips\n- Always verify the availability of the target location before placing or moving entities to avoid placement errors.\n- Regularly check the status and warnings of entities to ensure efficient operation and address any issues promptly."}
