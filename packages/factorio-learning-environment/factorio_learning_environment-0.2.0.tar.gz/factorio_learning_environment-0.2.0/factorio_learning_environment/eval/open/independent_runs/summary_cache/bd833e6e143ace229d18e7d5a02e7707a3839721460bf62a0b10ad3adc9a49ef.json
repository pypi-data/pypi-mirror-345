{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully created on the map. The agent repeatedly attempted to supply research via a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but all Lab placement and crafting efforts failed due to missing inventory items and insufficient sub-ingredients. Existing furnace entities were referenced during smelting operations (an iron furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)); however, these were pre\u2010existing facilities rather than structures built by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities() API misuse:\n\u2003 \u2013 Use the correct parameter signature when invoking get_entities(). Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and ensure the number of positional arguments matches the API\u2019s requirements.\n\u2022 Lab placement and retrieval issues:\n\u2003 \u2013 Before attempting Lab placement, verify that a Lab exists in the inventory to prevent \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d errors.\n\u2003 \u2013 When processing the list of Labs, account for cases where the retrieved value might be None (to avoid \u201cNoneType is not iterable\u201d errors).\n\u2022 Lab crafting resource shortages:\n\u2003 \u2013 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, copper-cables, and electronic-circuits) are available before initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2003 \u2013 Strengthen the production chain for prerequisite items to prevent repeated crafting failures due to missing ingredients.\n\u2022 Resource and inventory management:\n\u2003 \u2013 Monitor resource levels closely to ensure sufficient raw materials and intermediary products are available for both smelting operations and crafting processes."}
