{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (0.5, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (0.5, 23.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (7.5, 23.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup with fluid system ID 34197, carrying water, starting at Position (-9.5, 23.5) and connecting various positions including (-8.5, 23.5) to (-1.5, 23.5).\n- PipeGroup with fluid system ID 34187, currently empty, spanning positions from (-0.5, 17.5) to (7.5, 27.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 62525, consisting of small electric poles at various positions including (3.5, 20.5), (14.5, 20.5), and (35.5, 20.5), with a current voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for any missing or incorrectly placed pipes that may disrupt the fluid flow.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Always ensure that there is sufficient fuel in the inventory before attempting to insert it into a boiler or any other fuel-consuming entity.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and receiving input liquid. Check for any disconnected pipes or missing connections that may prevent the steam engine from functioning.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the item is not present in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler`: Represents the boiler entity at Position (0.5, 23.0).\n- `offshore_pump`: Represents the offshore pump entity at Position (-9.5, 24.5).\n- `steam_engine`: Represents the steam engine entity at Position (7.5, 23.5).\n- `pipe`: Represents the pipe entities connecting various fluid systems."}
