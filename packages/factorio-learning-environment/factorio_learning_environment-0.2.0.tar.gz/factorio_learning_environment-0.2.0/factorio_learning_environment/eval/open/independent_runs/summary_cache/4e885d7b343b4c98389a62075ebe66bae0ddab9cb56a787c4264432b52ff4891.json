{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, with pipes at various positions including (-8.5, 23.5) and (0.5, 22.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (0.5, 21.5), (-1.5, 26.5), (-0.5, 26.5), and (0.5, 26.5) for power distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace and a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storing materials\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (5.5, -60.5) for powering the inserter\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates and copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not in progress with any research\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a boiler without having coal in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without required items\n- Make sure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For instance, trying to connect a small electric pole without having it in the inventory led to a failure in connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
