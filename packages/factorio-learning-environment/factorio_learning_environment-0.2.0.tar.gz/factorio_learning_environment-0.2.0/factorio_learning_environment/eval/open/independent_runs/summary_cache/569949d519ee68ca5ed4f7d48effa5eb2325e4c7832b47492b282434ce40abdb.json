{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (x=1-5, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of three parallel smelting setups:\n- Furnace (x=1.0, y=1.0) with burner inserter (x=1.5, y=2.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=1.5, y=3.5)\n- Furnace (x=3.0, y=1.0) with burner inserter (x=3.5, y=2.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=3.5, y=3.5)\n- Empty furnace setup with burner inserter (x=5.5, y=2.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=5.5, y=3.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (x=2-4, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of two parallel smelting setups:\n- Furnace (x=2.0, y=7.0) with burner inserter (x=2.5, y=8.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=2.5, y=9.5)\n- Furnace (x=4.0, y=7.0) with burner inserter (x=4.5, y=8.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=4.5, y=9.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-5.5 to 13.5, y=26.5 to 37.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=2.5, y=35.5)\n- Pipe network connecting water supply\n- Boiler (x=7.0, y=35.5)\n- Steam engine (x=13.5, y=35.5)\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple power poles\n- Disconnected offshore pump (x=-5.5, y=26.5)\n\n### Research Facility (x=6.5-12.5, y=16.5-17.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two labs conducting logistics research\n- Lab at (x=6.5, y=16.5)\n- Lab at (x=12.5, y=17.5)\n- Connected to power network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid Connection Issues\n- Ensure offshore pumps are properly connected to the pipe network before operation\n- The disconnected offshore pump at x=-5.5 y=26.5 needs proper pipe connections to be functional\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- Furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - ensure continuous supply of raw materials\n- Consider setting up automated raw material input system for furnaces\n\n### Power System Management\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler to maintain consistent power generation\n- Current power system is working but requires manual coal resupply"}
