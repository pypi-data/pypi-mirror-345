Verify that the path between poles is clear of any obstructions.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the power network connections and ensure that the inserter is within the range of a powered electric pole.\n\n### Asserting Power Status\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the power network before asserting their power status. Check for any warnings or errors related to power connectivity."}
