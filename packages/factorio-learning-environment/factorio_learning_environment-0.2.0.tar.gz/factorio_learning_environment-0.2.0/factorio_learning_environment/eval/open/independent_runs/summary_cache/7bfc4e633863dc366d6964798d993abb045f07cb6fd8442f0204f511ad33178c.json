{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore and smelt it into iron plates.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=28.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=28.0, y=86.0)\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=30.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=30.0, y=86.0)\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=32.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=32.0, y=86.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fueling Failures and Logic Errors\n*   The agent repeatedly failed to fuel existing burner mining drills and stone furnaces across multiple steps (32-46, 49-55, and now 56-63). The logs consistently show `Successfully handled 0 entities. Fueled 0 entities.` despite identifying 6 entities that require fuel.\n*   Steps 40, 42-46, 49-55, 57, 58, 60, 61, and 63 consistently showed assertion errors related to entity count (`AssertionError: Logic error: Entity count mismatch. Handled: 0, Failed: 0, Total Found: 6`). This indicates a persistent flaw in the fueling logic where the count of processed entities (successfully fueled + failed) does not match the total number of entities identified for fueling. Review the loop or function responsible for iterating through and fueling entities to ensure it correctly handles every entity found."}
