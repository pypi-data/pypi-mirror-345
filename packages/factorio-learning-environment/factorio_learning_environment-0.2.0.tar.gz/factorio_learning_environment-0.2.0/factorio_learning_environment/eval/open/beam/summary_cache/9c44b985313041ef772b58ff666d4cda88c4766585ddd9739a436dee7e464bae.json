{"content": "The repeated output of only the initial print statement (\"Starting step-by-step diagnostic procedure...\") suggests that the script is not progressing past this point. This could be due to several reasons, such as the script encountering an error early in execution, or the environment not executing subsequent commands properly.\n\nHere are some steps to diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Silent Errors**: Ensure that any exceptions are being caught and printed. If an error occurs before the print statements, it might not be visible. Consider adding a generic exception handler to catch unexpected errors.\n\n2. **Verify Entity Retrieval**: The script might be failing to retrieve entities, which would cause it to raise an `AssertionError` and stop execution. Ensure that the entities are correctly placed in the game world and accessible by the script.\n\n3. **Add More Debugging Prints**: Insert additional print statements after each entity retrieval attempt to confirm whether the entities are being found. This will help identify which part of the retrieval process is failing.\n\n4. **Simplify the Script**: Start by checking just one entity and gradually add more to isolate where the problem might be occurring. This can help determine if the issue is with a specific entity retrieval.\n\n5. **Check Environment Setup**: Ensure that the Factorio REPL environment is properly set up and that all necessary components are loaded. There might be issues with the environment that prevent the script from executing as expected.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the script with additional debugging prints:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting step-by-step diagnostic procedure...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Attempt to retrieve just the Offshore Pump first\n    offshore_pump_entities = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    if offshore_pump_entities:\n        offshore_pump = offshore_pump_entities[0]\n        print(f\"Offshore Pump: {offshore_pump}\")\n    else:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Offshore Pump not found!\")\n\n    # Add more entities one by one to isolate issues\n    # Boiler\n    boiler_entities = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    if boiler_entities:\n        boiler = boiler_entities[0]\n        print(f\"Boiler: {boiler}\")\n    else:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Boiler not found!\")\n\n    # Continue with other entities...\n\nexcept AssertionError as error:\n    print(f\"Entity Retrieval Error: {error}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Unexpected error during diagnostics: {e}\")\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify where the script is encountering issues and address them accordingly.", "summary_range": "[1-332]"}
