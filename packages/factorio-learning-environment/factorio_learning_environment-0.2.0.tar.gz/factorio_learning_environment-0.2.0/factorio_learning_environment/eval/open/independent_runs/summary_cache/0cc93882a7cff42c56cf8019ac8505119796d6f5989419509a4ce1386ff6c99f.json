{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is responsible for mining iron ore and placing it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, -58.5), (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (9.5, -60.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) is used to store mined iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). These furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Each furnace is fueled by coal and has a source inventory for iron ore and a result inventory for iron plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage capacity.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to avoid production halts. Regularly check and replenish the furnace source inventory.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in the inventory to avoid operation failures.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure can occur if the item is not available in the inventory.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `drill`: Represents the burner mining drill entity, used in operations such as inserting fuel.\n  - `furnace_source`: Inventory for storing raw materials in furnaces.\n  - `furnace_result`: Inventory for storing processed materials in furnaces."}
