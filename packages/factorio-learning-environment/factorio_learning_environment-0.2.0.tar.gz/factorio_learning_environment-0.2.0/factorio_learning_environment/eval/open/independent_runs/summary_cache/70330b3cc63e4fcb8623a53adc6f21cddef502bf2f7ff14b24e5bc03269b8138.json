{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with output blocked warning, indicating no sink entity to accept output.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to other entities, positioned at (x=41.5, y=-85.5), (x=41.5, y=-84.5), (x=41.5, y=-83.5), and (x=41.5, y=-82.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) with a warning that the chest is full, waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-81.5) and another at (x=42.5, y=-80.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, currently holding iron plates.\n- BeltGroups with various inputs and outputs, facilitating the transport of materials across the facility.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nComprises multiple BeltGroups facilitating the movement of resources:\n- BeltGroup with inputs at (x=50.5, y=-86.5) and outputs at (x=49.5, y=-86.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs at (x=54.5, y=-86.5) and outputs at (x=52.5, y=-82.5).\n- Additional BeltGroups connecting various positions, ensuring resource flow across the facility.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Rotation\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly oriented to drop items into the intended target, such as a chest or belt. Double-check the inserter's drop position and the target's position.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockage\n- Make sure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests to ensure they have space for incoming items. Consider expanding storage capacity or processing items to avoid bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients for smelting. Regularly supply raw materials to maintain production efficiency."}
