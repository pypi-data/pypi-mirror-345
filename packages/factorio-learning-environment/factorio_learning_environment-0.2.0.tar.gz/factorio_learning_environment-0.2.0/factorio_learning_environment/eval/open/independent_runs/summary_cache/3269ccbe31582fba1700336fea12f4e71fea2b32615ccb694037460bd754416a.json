{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is currently working with coal as fuel and has iron ore as input.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest. It is fueled by coal and is operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates transferred from the furnace via the burner inserter.\n\n### Iron Plate Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto the transport belt. It is fueled by coal and is operational.\n- **Transport Belt** (BeltGroup) connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), transporting iron plates from the chest to the end chest.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to the end wooden chest. It is fueled by coal and is operational.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied\n- Ensure that there is enough space and no other entity occupies the intended position before placing a new entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position if placement fails.\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect them to a transport belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required raw materials\n- Ensure all necessary raw materials are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, wood must be gathered as it cannot be crafted."}
