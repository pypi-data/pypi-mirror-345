{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (0.5, 28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Boiler at Position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (10.5, 34.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these components, with positions ranging from (-3.5, 26.5) to (10.5, 31.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (40.5, -82.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter at Position (54.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -80.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (56.5, -83.5) for iron plate storage\n- Iron Chests at Positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) for additional storage\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Ensure that chests used for storage are not full to avoid halting production. Regularly check and empty chests to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Power Connection\n- Ensure that all power-generating structures are connected to the power network to avoid interruptions in power supply.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Supply\n- Regularly refuel boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established and that there is fluid present in the connections to maintain functionality of fluid-dependent structures."}
