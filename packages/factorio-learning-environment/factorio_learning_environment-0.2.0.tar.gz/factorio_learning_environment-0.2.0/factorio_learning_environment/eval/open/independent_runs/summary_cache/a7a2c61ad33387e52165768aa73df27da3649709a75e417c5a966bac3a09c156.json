{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at position(40.0, -82.0)\nAutomated coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (40.0, -82.0)\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -83.5) for fuel handling\n- Transport belt system starting at (39.5, -83.5) moving coal downwards\n\n### Iron Smelting Complex around position(45.0, -80.0)\nTwo parallel smelting lines consisting of:\n1. First line:\n   - Stone furnace at (45.0, -80.0)\n   - Input inserter at (45.5, -78.5)\n   - Output inserter at (45.5, -81.5)\n   - Input chest at (45.5, -77.5)\n   - Output chest at (45.5, -82.5)\n\n2. Second line:\n   - Stone furnace at (47.0, -80.0)\n   - Input inserter at (47.5, -78.5)\n   - Output inserter at (47.5, -81.5)\n   - Input chest at (47.5, -77.5)\n   - Output chest at (47.5, -82.5)\n\n### Storage System\nMultiple storage chests:\n- Chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing coal (full)\n- Chest at (49.5, -79.5) storing coal and iron plates (full)\n- Chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Always check if target position is clear before placing entities\n   - Error seen when trying to place burner-inserter at occupied position (39.5, -82.5)\n\n2. Belt System Blockages\n   - Transport belts getting blocked, preventing mining operations\n   - Ensure proper item flow and belt clearance at key positions like (39.5, -83.5)\n\n3. Space Management\n   - Multiple chests reaching full capacity, blocking further operations\n   - Implement better storage management or expand storage capacity\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Position: Custom type for x,y coordinates\n- Direction: Enum for UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n- EntityStatus: Enum for entity states (NORMAL, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, etc.)\n- Inventory: Container type for storing items\n\nEntity Types:\n- BurnerMiningDrill\n- BurnerInserter\n- Furnace\n- Chest\n- BeltGroup\n\nAll structures appear to be functional but operating at various efficiency levels due to space and blockage constraints."}
