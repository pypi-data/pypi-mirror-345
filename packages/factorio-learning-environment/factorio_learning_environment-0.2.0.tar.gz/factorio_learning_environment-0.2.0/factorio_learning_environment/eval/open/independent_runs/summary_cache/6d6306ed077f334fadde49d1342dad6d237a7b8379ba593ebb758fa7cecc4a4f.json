{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully established on the map. Multiple recovery updates attempted to supply Automation Science Packs by creating a Laboratory at (0.5, 2.5), but lab placement and crafting failed due to inventory shortages and missing sub-ingredients. Although existing furnace facilities were referenced during smelting operations (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron and one at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper), no new structure was added, and the overall map state remains without placed entities.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Misuse in get_entities Calls\n  - Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (e.g., remove 'radius' when not supported).\n  - Ensure arguments are passed as specified by the API to prevent positional argument errors.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n  - Verify that required lab units are present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  - Confirm that all sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, etc.) are sufficiently available and that the production chain is set up to meet recipe requirements.\n\u2022 Iteration over NoneType Objects\n  - Check that functions returning collections (e.g., get_entities) do not return None before iterating, and implement fallbacks (like an empty list) where needed."}
