{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created or placed on the map as of the latest execution steps. The logs indicate attempts to place entities, but no successful placements have been recorded.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing any entity, such as a Stone Furnace or Wooden Chest, is buildable. Check the terrain and any existing restrictions before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or restricted areas\n- Verify that the intended position for placing entities like Wooden Chests and Transport Belts is not occupied or restricted by the environment settings. Conduct a check for global build restrictions and ensure the area is clear.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources or incorrect positioning\n- Confirm that resources such as coal are available and that the entity is correctly placed to receive resources. For example, ensure that Stone Furnaces have access to coal if needed.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Before placing any entity, ensure that the position is valid and that there are no environmental or positional constraints that could prevent successful placement."}
