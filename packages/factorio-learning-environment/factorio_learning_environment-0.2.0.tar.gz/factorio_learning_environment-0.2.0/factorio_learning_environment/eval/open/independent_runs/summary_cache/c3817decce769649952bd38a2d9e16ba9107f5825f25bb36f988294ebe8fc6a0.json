{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (x=6.5, y=20.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=6.5, y=20.0) with status `NOT_CONNECTED`, warnings include 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- Steam Engine at position (x=7.5, y=23.5) with status `NOT_CONNECTED`, warnings include 'not connected to power network', 'no input liquid', and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- Pipe at position (x=5.5, y=26.5) with status `NOT_CONNECTED`.\n- Pipe at position (x=6.5, y=26.5) with status `NOT_CONNECTED`.\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=9.5, y=23.5) with status `NOT_CONNECTED`.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=11.5, y=21.5) with status `EMPTY`.\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (x=3.5, y=18.5), (x=7.5, y=17.5), (x=9.5, y=23.5), (x=1.5, y=17.5), and (x=4.5, y=24.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure that the target location for placing a pipe is free from any existing objects. If an object is present, remove it before attempting to place the pipe.\n- Double-check the target location coordinates to ensure they are not already occupied by another entity.\n\n#### Connection Errors\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity generator, such as the boiler and steam engine, are properly connected to each other and to the power network.\n- Verify that all necessary input liquids are supplied to the boiler and steam engine to avoid warnings related to 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**: None assigned."}
