{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nUse-case: Processes iron ore into iron plates. The cycle now confirms a consistent production flow with the furnace being monitored during extraction; a recent extraction operation removed 1 Iron Plate from its output, maintaining a stable production cycle.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient production output and delayed processing\n- Verify that the processing cycle receives adequate time to complete to meet production targets.\n- Adjust waiting periods or processing cycles to avoid timeouts when output production falls short.\n\n### Errors when inserting items despite resource unavailability\n- Confirm that inventory contains the intended resource prior to attempting insertion.\n- Double-check inventory levels to prevent errors arising from trying to insert a resource not present in the inventory."}
