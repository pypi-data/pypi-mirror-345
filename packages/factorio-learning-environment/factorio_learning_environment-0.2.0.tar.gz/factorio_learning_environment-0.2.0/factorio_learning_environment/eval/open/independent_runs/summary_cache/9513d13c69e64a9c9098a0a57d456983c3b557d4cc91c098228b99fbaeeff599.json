{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5), connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) storing iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) transferring items from the chest to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** starting at (x=-12.5, y=-51.5) and ending at (x=0.5, y=-1.5), moving iron ore towards the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) transferring items from the transport belt to the stone furnace.\n\n### Belt System\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the mining operation to the furnace, consisting of:\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction DOWN.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Full Chest\n- Ensure the chest at the mining drill's drop position is regularly emptied to prevent mining stoppages. The chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) is full, causing the mining drill to halt operations.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operation\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path and are not waiting for source items unnecessarily. The burner inserter at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or misalignment in the belt system.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources.\n  - `entities`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently on the map."}
