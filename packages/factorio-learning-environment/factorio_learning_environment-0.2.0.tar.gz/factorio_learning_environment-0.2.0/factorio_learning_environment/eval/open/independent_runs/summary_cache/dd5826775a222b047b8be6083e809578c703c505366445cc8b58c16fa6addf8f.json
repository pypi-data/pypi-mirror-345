{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Processing System (around position -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (working, contains 47 coal as fuel)\n- Storage chest (contains 755-789 coal)\n- Transport belt (working, input at x=41.5 y=-81.5, output at x=43.5 y=-81.5)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  * First inserter at position (42.5, -81.5)\n  * Second inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\n- Furnace (has 50 coal as fuel, no ingredients)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Inventory Management Issues\n- Clear inventory space before attempting to craft new items\n- Ensure there are enough free slots for crafting sub-components like iron-gear-wheels\n\n2. Resource Gathering Issues\n- Cannot craft raw resources like wood - these must be gathered from the environment\n- Ensure required raw materials are collected before attempting to craft items that need them\n\n3. Entity Placement Issues\n- Check if required items are in inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Verify entity placement coordinates are valid and unoccupied\n\n4. Inserter Issues\n- Monitor inserter capacity - they have a maximum capacity (50 items)\n- Don't attempt to insert items into full inserters\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- insert_item(prototype, target, quantity): Attempts to insert items into target entity\n  * Fails if target inventory is full\n  * Fails if target entity cannot accept items\n\n- place_entity(entity_type, position): Places entity at specified coordinates\n  * Fails if required entity not in inventory\n  * Fails if position is occupied\n\nVariables:\n- first_inserter: EntityReference (burner-inserter)\n- second_inserter: EntityReference (burner-inserter)\n- Current inventory: Dictionary containing:\n  * transport-belt: 12\n  * coal: 3698-3748\n  * iron-plate: 365"}
