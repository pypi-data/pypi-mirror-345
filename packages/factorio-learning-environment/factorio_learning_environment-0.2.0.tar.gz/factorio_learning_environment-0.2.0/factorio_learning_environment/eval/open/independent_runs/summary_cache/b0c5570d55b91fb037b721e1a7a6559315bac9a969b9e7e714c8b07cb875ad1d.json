{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Multiple small electric poles connecting the steam engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for transferring iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Additional Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with iron plates\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, currently empty and not connected\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with no power, requiring automation science packs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure there is no blockage in the path where pipes are being connected. Clear any obstructions before attempting to connect pipes.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items into Furnaces\n- Verify the type of ore already present in the furnace before inserting new items. Ensure the furnace inventory is not full and matches the type of ore being inserted.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory in Furnaces\n- Check the furnace inventory capacity before attempting to insert items. Ensure there is enough space to accommodate the new items."}
