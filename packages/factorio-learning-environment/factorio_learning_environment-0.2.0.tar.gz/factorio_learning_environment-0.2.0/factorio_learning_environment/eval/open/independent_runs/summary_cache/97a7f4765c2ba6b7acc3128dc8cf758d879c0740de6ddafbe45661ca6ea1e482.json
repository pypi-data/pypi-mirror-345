{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the structures and providing error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position(41.0, -85.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-85.0) facing DOWN\n- Burner inserter (position x=41.5, y=-83.5) facing RIGHT\n- Wooden chest (position x=42.5, y=-83.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nTwo parallel mining and smelting lines:\n1. First line:\n   - Burner mining drill (position x=-20.0, y=-54.0) facing DOWN\n   - Stone furnace (position x=-19.0, y=-52.0)\n\n2. Second line:\n   - Burner mining drill (position x=-14.0, y=-56.0) facing DOWN\n   - Stone furnace (position x=-13.0, y=-54.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Mining Drill Output Blockage Issues\n- Mining drills are showing warnings about blocked outputs due to items on the ground\n- Ensure proper item collection systems (inserters/belts) are in place to prevent output blockage\n\n### Entity Placement and Connection\n- Make sure entities that need to interact are properly aligned and connected\n- Verify drop positions of mining drills align with input positions of destination entities\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Coal drill status: EntityStatus.WORKING\n- Coal inserter pickup position: Position(x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n- Coal inserter drop position: Position(x=42.5, y=-83.5)\n- Coal inserter status: EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n\nEntity States:\n- Mining drills: All operational with fuel (coal: 4-7 units)\n- Furnaces: Both working with fuel (coal: 9 units each)\n- Inserter: Waiting for source items with adequate fuel (coal: 13 units)"}
