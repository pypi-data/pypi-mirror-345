{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures created on the map. The agent attempted to place various entities, but all attempts were unsuccessful, resulting in no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is buildable. Check the terrain and any existing restrictions before attempting to place entities like Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Verify that you have the necessary resources available before attempting to place entities. For example, ensure that coal is available to supply to a Furnace if it is placed.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied or restricted\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the tile is not occupied by another entity or restricted by game rules. This will prevent placement errors for entities like Wooden Chests and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without checking environmental settings\n- Always check environmental settings and responsiveness to ensure that the area is suitable for placing entities. This includes verifying global build restrictions and environmental conditions.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in building structures and managing resources in the game."}
