SYSTEM INFORMATION

Operating System: {os}
Default Shell: {shell}
Home Directory: {home_dir}
Current Workspace Directory: {pwd}

Current Time: {current_time}

The Current Workspace Directory is the active project directory, and is therefore the default directory for all tool operations. You don't have to create a project directory. When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current workspace directory ('{pwd}') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current workspace directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.
