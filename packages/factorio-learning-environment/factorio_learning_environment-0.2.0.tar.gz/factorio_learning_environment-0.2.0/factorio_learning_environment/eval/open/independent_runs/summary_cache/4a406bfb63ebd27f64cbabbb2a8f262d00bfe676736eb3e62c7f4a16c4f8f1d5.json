{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with a burner inserter at position (-17.5, -48.5) supplying it.\n- Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) supplying it.\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) connected with burner inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5) and (-14.5, -45.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting from position (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5) and from (-8.5, -45.5) to (-8.5, -43.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting from position (-12.5, -44.5) to (-12.5, -46.5) and from (-12.5, -45.5) to (-11.5, -46.5).\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe group connecting water from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with no research in progress, inputting automation science packs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Placement and Operation\n- Ensure that the drop position of inserters is not blocked by other entities or items. Adjust the inserter's drop position or clear the destination to avoid blockage.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of boilers and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure that chests and other storage entities have sufficient space to accommodate incoming items to prevent overflow and production halts."}
