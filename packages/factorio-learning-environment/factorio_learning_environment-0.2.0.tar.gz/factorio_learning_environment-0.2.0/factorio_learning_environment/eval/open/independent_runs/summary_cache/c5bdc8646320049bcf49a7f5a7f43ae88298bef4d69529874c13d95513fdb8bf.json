{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory of coal, working status, and a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) with a working status, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Secondary Iron Processing at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for resource input.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-11.5, -46.5) and (-11.5, -45.5) waiting for source items, indicating a blockage or lack of resources.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-4.5, -48.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-3.5, -48.5) and (-6.5, -47.5) are empty, indicating potential storage capacity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity before attempting to extract items to avoid extraction failures.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Errors\n- Regularly check and clear the drop positions of inserters to prevent blockages and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Resource Input Errors\n- Ensure furnaces have a continuous supply of resources to prevent them from running out of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnace\n- Verify that the furnace has the required items available before attempting extraction to avoid extraction failures."}
