{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions including (-47.5, -122.5) to (-45.5, -117.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5) not receiving power\n\n### Power Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, but currently not supplying power due to missing connections or lack of power sources\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target location is clear of any existing objects before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent errors like \"Could not place steam-engine at the target location - something is in the way.\"\n\n### Errors when connecting to the power network\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network. This will prevent errors like \"Failed to connect small-electric-pole due to missing items.\"\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. Ensure that power sources like steam engines are operational and connected to the network to avoid issues like \"Inserter is still not receiving power.\"\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel and raw materials for entities like furnaces and mining drills to prevent warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" or \"out of fuel.\""}
