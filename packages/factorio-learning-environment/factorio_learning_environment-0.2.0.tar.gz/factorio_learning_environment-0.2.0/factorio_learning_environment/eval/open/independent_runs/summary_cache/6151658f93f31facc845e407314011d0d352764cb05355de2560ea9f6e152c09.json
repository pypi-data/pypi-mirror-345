{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of two furnaces working in parallel:\n- Furnace 1 at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at position(2.0, 0.0)\nBoth furnaces process iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production\n- Furnace at position(4.0, 4.0) processing copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Electronic Circuit Assembly Line\nLocated around position(9.5, 11.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine at position(9.5, 11.5)\n- Input chest at position(6.5, 11.5)\n- Output chest at position(12.5, 11.5) containing 11 electronic circuits\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - At position(7.5, 11.5) moving items from input chest to assembler\n  - At position(11.5, 11.5) moving items from assembler to output chest\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position(-7.0, 24.5), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network carrying water at positions(-9.5,23.5),(-8.5,23.5),(-8.5,22.5),(-7.5,22.5)\n- Boiler at position(-7.0, 24.5)\n- Steam pipe at position(-5.5, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5, 24.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting power consumers\n\n### Research Lab\nLab conducting logistics research, currently working with 15 automation science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource shortage errors\n- Monitor inventory levels of key resources (coal, iron ore, copper ore)\n- Harvest resources before they run out to maintain continuous production\n\n### Inserter waiting errors\n- Ensure source containers have items available for inserters to pick up\n- Check if destination containers have space available\n\n### Assembly machine ingredient shortage\n- Keep a steady supply of all required ingredients (iron plates and copper cables)\n- Balance production of intermediate products to match consumption rates\n\n### Power system management\n- Maintain adequate coal supply in boiler to prevent power outages\n- Monitor steam and water levels in the power generation system"}
