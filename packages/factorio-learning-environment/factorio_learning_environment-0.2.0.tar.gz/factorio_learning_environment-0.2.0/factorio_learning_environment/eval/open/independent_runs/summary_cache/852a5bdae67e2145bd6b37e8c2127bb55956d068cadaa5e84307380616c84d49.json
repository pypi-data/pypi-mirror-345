{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) and (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Multiple burner inserters at positions (x=-17.5, y=-48.5), (x=-13.5, y=-47.5), (x=-14.5, y=-45.5), (x=-13.5, y=-45.5), (x=-11.5, y=-45.5), (x=-9.5, y=-44.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-43.5) for moving materials between entities.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) and iron chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) for storing materials.\n- Belt groups connecting various entities, including:\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) moving right.\n  - Belt from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5) moving down.\n  - Additional belts connecting furnaces and inserters.\n\n### Electricity Generation Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5) for heating water.\n- Steam engine at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5) for generating electricity.\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) for supplying water.\n- Pipe group connecting the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump, with pipes at positions (x=-8.5, y=21.5), (x=-7.5, y=21.5), (x=-8.5, y=22.5), (x=-8.5, y=23.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n- Electricity group with poles at various positions providing electrical connections.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure the positions of the boiler and steam engine are correctly aligned and within reach of the pipe connections. Verify that the pipe network is complete and correctly placed to allow fluid flow.\n\n### Errors when setting research\n- Confirm that the technology you are trying to research is not already researched. Check the current research status before setting a new research target.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. Ensure adequate supply of resources in your inventory to avoid insertion errors."}
