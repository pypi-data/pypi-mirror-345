Always ensure that belts are linked to an inserter (or another valid item\u2011receiving entity) rather than directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine object.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Error (Step 212)\n\u2013 The placement of a wooden chest failed because the target position was too far from the player. Move closer to the desired target so that placement occurs within the maximum allowed distance.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Availability Error (Step 213)\n\u2013 An attempt to place a wooden chest failed due to its absence in the inventory. Verify that the necessary entity is available in inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Error (Step 212)\n\u2013 A NameError occurred because \u2018target_chest\u2019 was not defined. Ensure that all variables are properly defined and referenced to prevent such errors."}
