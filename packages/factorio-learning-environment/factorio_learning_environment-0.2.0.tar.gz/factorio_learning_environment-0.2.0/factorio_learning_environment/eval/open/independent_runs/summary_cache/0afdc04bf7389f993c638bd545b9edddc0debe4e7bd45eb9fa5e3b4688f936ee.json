Despite several manual copper plate transfers and recipe resets, it continues to report warnings: [\"not receiving electricity\", \"cannot create copper-cable due to missing resources: copper-plate (1)\"] and shows an energy level of 0.0.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=17.5) refueled with coal yet still waiting for source items.\n- Input Chest at position (x=1.5, y=16.5) designated to receive copper plates.\n- Output Chest at position (x=1.5, y=21.5) for dispatching copper-cable.\n- Dedicated Copper Buffer Chest at position (x=-5.5, y=21.5) holding copper plates.\nNote: Multiple manual transfers\u2014from furnace to buffer chest and then to the input chest\u2014and a forced direct power connection have been attempted to resolve resource and electrical issues, but the copper-plate shortage and lack of power at AssemblingMachine1 persist.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Fuel and Resource Management:\n   - Maintain sufficient coal and raw materials; confirm that smelting operations fully supply copper plates before initiating transfers.\n\u2022 Entity Placement & Collision Avoidance:\n   - Verify that the target positions for placement (such as for small electric poles) are unoccupied; adjust spacing or change directions when placement conflicts occur.\n\u2022 API and Variable Usage:\n   - Ensure that all entity references are valid and non-nil before using them in operations (for example, when force-connecting power between the steam engine and AssemblingMachine1).\n\u2022 Power Connectivity:\n   - Review and validate power network connections; if a direct connection attempt fails, recheck setup and wiring to ensure robust electrical routing.\n\u2022 Supply Chain Coordination:\n   - Synchronize resource transfers so that automated inserters and assembling machines receive materials without requiring repeated manual intervention."}
