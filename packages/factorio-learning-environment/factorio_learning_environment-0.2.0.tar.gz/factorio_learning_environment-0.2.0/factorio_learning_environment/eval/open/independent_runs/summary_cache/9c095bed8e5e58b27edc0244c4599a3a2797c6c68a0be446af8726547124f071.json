{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel and iron-plate output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel.\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5).\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with coal fuel.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5).\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 22.5), (-9.5, 22.5), and others.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to small-electric-poles.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron-plates.\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with automation-science-pack input, not receiving power.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Multiple small-electric-poles at various positions such as (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (0.5, 21.5), and others, currently not connected to the power network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes is free from water and other obstructions. Consider adjusting the placement strategy to avoid overlapping with existing entities or water bodies.\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Verify that the target position for electric poles is not occupied by other entities. Clear any existing objects before attempting to place electric poles.\n\n### Connection errors in power network\n- Ensure that all components of the power network, such as steam engines and electric poles, are correctly connected without any placement blockages. Check for any obstructions that may prevent successful connections.\n\n### Power supply issues\n- Address the lack of power supply to the lab and inserters by ensuring that the electricity generation setup is fully operational and connected to the power network."}
