{"content": "Ah, now I see the real issue! The error is telling us that we can't place the burner inserter because there's already a stone furnace at the position we're trying to place it. The spacing and position calculations need to be adjusted.\n\nLet's modify the code to fix the inserter placement:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# First get some coal\ncoal_pos = nearest(Resource.Coal)\nmove_to(coal_pos)\nharvest_resource(coal_pos, quantity=20)\nprint(\"Harvested coal\")\n\n# Now let's fuel the unfueled mining drill\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\ndrill = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\nif drill:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(f\"Added fuel to mining drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n# Craft a stone furnace\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nprint(\"Crafted stone furnace\")\n\n# Now let's place the furnace and set it up\nmove_to(Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0))\n\n# Place the furnace\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0),\n    direction=Direction.UP\n)\n\nif furnace:\n    print(f\"Placed new furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    # Add fuel to the furnace\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n    # Add input inserter with increased spacing\n    input_inserter = place_entity_next_to(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n        reference_position=furnace.position,\n        direction=Direction.LEFT,\n        spacing=2  # Increased spacing to avoid collision\n    )\n    \n    if input_inserter:\n        print(f\"Added input inserter at {input_inserter.position}\")\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, input_inserter, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added fuel to input inserter\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Current entities: {entities}\")\n```\n\nKey changes made:\n1. Increased the spacing parameter in place_entity_next_to from 1 to 2\n2. This should give enough room for the inserter to be placed without overlapping with the furnace\n\nThe error we were getting was because the inserter was trying to occupy the same space as the furnace. By increasing the spacing, we should now have enough room for both entities.", "summary_range": "[1-864]"}
