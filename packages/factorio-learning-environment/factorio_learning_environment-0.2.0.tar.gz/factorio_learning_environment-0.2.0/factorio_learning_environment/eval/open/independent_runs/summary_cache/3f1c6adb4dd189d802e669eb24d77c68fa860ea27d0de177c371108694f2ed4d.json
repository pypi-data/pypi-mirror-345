{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Storage at Position (-11.5, -49.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest containing iron ore.\n\n### Coal Storage at Position (54.5, -78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest containing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer Station at Position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest used for transferring iron ore from the storage at (-11.5, -49.5).\n\n### Coal Transfer Station at Position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest used for transferring coal from the storage at (54.5, -78.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting into full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has sufficient space before attempting to insert items. This can be done by checking the current inventory size and comparing it with the maximum capacity.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into stone furnace\n- Before inserting coal into a stone furnace, verify that the furnace has available space. If the furnace is full, consider removing some items or waiting until there is space available.\n\n### Errors when extracting coal with full target inventory\n- When transferring items to a chest, ensure that the chest has enough space to accommodate the new items. If the chest is full, consider transferring items to another storage or using them in production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore_chest_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Inventory of the iron ore chest.\n  - `coal_chest_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Inventory of the coal chest.\n  - `target_chest_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Inventory of the target chest for iron ore and coal.\n  - `stone_furnace_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Inventory of the stone furnace."}
