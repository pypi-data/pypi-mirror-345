{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) with status EntityStatus.WORKING, currently extracting resources.\n\n### Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) with status EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS, currently unable to smelt due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from the wooden chest\n- Ensure the wooden chest contains coal before attempting to extract. The chest was found empty multiple times, leading to extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when placing the wooden chest\n- Ensure that the wooden chest is placed in an unoccupied tile. The agent successfully picked up and replaced the chest, but it was noted that the inventory was empty after replacement.\n\n### Errors when the burner mining drill is out of fuel\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill is adequately fueled before attempting to use it. The drill was noted to be in EntityStatus.NO_FUEL multiple times.\n\n### Errors when the chest at drop position is full\n- Empty the wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) to continue mining. The burner mining drill reported that the chest was full, preventing further extraction.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, wooden_chest.position, quantity=1)` \n  - **Failure Mode**: Could not extract coal due to the chest being empty.\n  - **Success Mode**: Successfully extracts coal when available.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_coal`: int\n- `wooden_chest`: Entity\n- `burner_mining_drill`: Entity\n- `furnace`: Entity\n- `current_inventory`: dict"}
