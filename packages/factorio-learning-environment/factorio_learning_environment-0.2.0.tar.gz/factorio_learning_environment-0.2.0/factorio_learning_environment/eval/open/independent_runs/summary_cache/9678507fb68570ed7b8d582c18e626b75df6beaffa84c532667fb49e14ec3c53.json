{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -25.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is intended to generate electricity, while the boiler is used to convert water into steam, and the offshore pump is used to supply water to the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18, -49)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18, -49) and a furnace at position (-18, -49).\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, -73) and a furnace at position (5, -73).\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is used for research and development.\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position (-18, -49) to the assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to boiler and steam engine connectivity\n- Ensure that the boiler is connected to a suitable pipe group to allow for water flow. Check for any missing connections or obstructions.\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to the power network and that the boiler is operational to generate steam.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient resources\n- Ensure that all necessary resources are available for crafting and that the machines are supplied with the required ingredients."}
