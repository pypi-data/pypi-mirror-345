{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\n- **Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)**\n  - Stone furnace with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)**\n  - Stone furnace with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Unspecified Furnace\n- **Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)**\n  - Stone furnace with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Research Lab Setup\n- **Lab**\n  - Lab with automation science packs, currently not powered.\n- **Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5)**\n  - Inserter not receiving electricity, connected to small electric poles and a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chests**\n  - Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)**\n  - Not connected, no fluid present in connections.\n- **Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)**\n  - Not connected, no input liquid.\n- **Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)**\n  - Not generating power, not connected to power network.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 10.5)**\n  - Empty fluid system.\n- **PipeGroup at Position (-9.5, 22.5)**\n  - Empty fluid system.\n- **PipeGroup at Position (-8.5, 23.5)**\n  - Empty fluid system.\n- **PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 22.5)**\n  - Empty fluid system.\n- **PipeGroup at Position (-6.5, 25.5)**\n  - Empty fluid system.\n- **PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)**\n  - Empty fluid system.\n\n### Electricity Networks\n- **ElectricityGroup ID 75176**\n  - Poles at various positions, voltage is 0.\n- **ElectricityGroup ID 75186**\n  - Poles at various positions, voltage is 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using attributes of objects\n- Ensure that you are accessing valid attributes of objects. For example, 'PipeGroup' does not have a 'prototype' attribute.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Verify that the pipes are correctly aligned and that there are no blockages preventing connections. Ensure the path is clear from the offshore pump to the boiler and from the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors when connecting electrical poles\n- Ensure that all electrical poles are within range and properly connected to form a complete circuit. Check for any placement blockages that might prevent connections.\n\n### Steam engine not generating power\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that the boiler is receiving water from the offshore pump. Check for any missing connections or blockages in the fluid system."}
