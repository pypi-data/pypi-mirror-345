{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, with various pipes at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to the furnace and a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates and copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs but no research in progress, connected to the electricity network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Research Management\n- Ensure that the research is correctly set before attempting to start it. Verify that the research name and prerequisites are correctly specified.\n\n### Errors in Item Insertion\n- When using the `insert_item` function, ensure that the second argument is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Correct the usage by passing the appropriate entity reference.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Check that inserters are connected to a power source. Ensure that the electricity network is properly configured and that all connected poles are functional.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Fuel Supply\n- Ensure that boilers have a sufficient fuel supply to operate. Regularly check and refill fuel as needed to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Verify that steam engines are properly connected to the power network and that there is a continuous supply of steam. Check all fluid connections and ensure no blockages or disconnections."}
