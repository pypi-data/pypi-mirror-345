{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 72-79)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5) connected to water pipe network\n- Boiler (position -5.0, -0.5) with connection issues (status: NO_FUEL)\n- Steam engine (position -1.5, -0.5) not properly connected (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Water pipe network (system 3195) from pump to boiler\n- Attempted steam pipe connections between boiler and engine (failed)\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 17.5, 70.5) with 35 iron ore\n- Transport belt (position 17.5, 72.5) now cleared\n- Small electric pole (position 15.5, 72.5) providing power\n- Belt group connecting to position (25.5, 72.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent boiler connection issues\n- Multiple boiler status assertion failures (steps 74-77)\n- Steam engine not receiving steam (step 79)\n- Solutions:\n  - Verify all pipe connections are clear before placement\n  - Check fluid flow directions match connection points\n  - Ensure no obstructions between boiler and engine\n\n### Pipe placement failures\n- Blocked pipe placement at (-5.5, 1.5) (step 78)\n- Invalid pipe connections (step 79)\n- Solutions:\n  - Scan target positions before pipe placement\n  - Verify connection points are accessible\n  - Use pipe-to-ground for crossing obstacles\n\n### Belt connection problems\n- Failed belt path normalization (step 72)\n- Solutions:\n  - Clear entire belt path before connection attempts\n  - Verify belt directions match intended flow\n  - Use underground belts for crossing obstacles\n\n### Entity retrieval issues\n- Missing burner inserter (step 73)\n- Solutions:\n  - Implement entity existence verification\n  - Add error handling for missing entities\n  - Maintain entity position tracking\n\n### Inventory management\n- Boiler fuel warnings (step 74)\n- Solutions:\n  - Implement automated fuel monitoring\n  - Set minimum fuel thresholds\n  - Prioritize fuel collection when levels low\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(source: Entity, target: Entity) -> BeltGroup`\n  - Needs improved fluid connection handling\n  - Should include position validation\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler: Boiler` - Critical power component (needs fixing)\n- `steam_engine: Generator` - Not properly connected\n- `pipe_network: PipeGroup` - System 3195 operational\n- Power network variables need monitoring\n- Belt system variables require proper initialization"}
