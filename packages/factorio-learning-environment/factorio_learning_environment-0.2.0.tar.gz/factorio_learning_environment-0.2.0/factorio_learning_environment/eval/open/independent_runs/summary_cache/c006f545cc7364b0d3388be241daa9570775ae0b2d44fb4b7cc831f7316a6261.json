{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to various positions\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-19.0, -65.0) and (-21.0, -62.0) with associated Burner Inserters at positions (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) respectively\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect exist and have valid positions. The error \"AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'\" suggests that one of the entities (either the mining drill or the furnace) was not properly initialized or does not exist at the time of connection. Double-check entity initialization and existence before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Several entities, such as furnaces and mining drills, have warnings indicating they are out of fuel. Ensure that these entities are refueled regularly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Inserters are waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or lack of input materials. Verify that the input sources are supplying the necessary items and that there are no blockages in the transport belt network."}
