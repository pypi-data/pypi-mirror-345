{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nBased on the execution logs, I can identify the following structures:\n\n###Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (around position 41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- A chest at position (41.5, -80.5) containing coal\n- A mining drill (position not specified, but connected to the chest)\n- A furnace (position not specified) that's currently without ingredients\n- An inserter facing right at position (42.5, -80.5) with drop position (44.5, -80.5)\n\nThe structure appears to be a mining and smelting operation that's currently experiencing issues with full storage and material flow.\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Inventory Management Issues\n- Clear inventory before attempting to craft new items\n- Ensure sufficient inventory slots are available before crafting components\n- When inventory is full, prioritize storing or using existing materials before crafting new ones\n\n2. Entity Placement Issues\n- Verify that required items (like burner-inserter) are in inventory before attempting placement\n- Check for entity conflicts before placing new structures\n\n3. Material Flow Issues\n- Monitor chest capacity and implement emptying routines before they become full\n- Ensure proper connection between components (mining drill -> chest -> inserter -> furnace)\n\n4. Transport System Issues\n- Verify existence of transport belts before attempting to reference them\n- Ensure proper placement and connection of transport system components\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- get_entity(prototype: Prototype, position: Position) -> Entity\n  Success: Returns entity at specified position\n  Failure: When entity of specified type doesn't exist at position\n\nVariables:\n- transport-belt: int (13 units)\n- stone-furnace: int (1 unit)\n- wood: int (2 units)\n- coal: int (2900 units)\n- iron-plate: int (1868 units)\n\nEntity States:\n- Drill status: EntityStatus.WORKING\n- Furnace status: EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Second inserter status: EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS"}
