{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full. It is currently working and connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) containing iron ore, status normal.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) waiting for source items, connected to:\n    - **Transport Belt** starting at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) and ending at (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction RIGHT.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with warnings for no ingredients to smelt and furnace result being full, currently has iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) waiting for source items, connected to:\n  - **Transport Belt** starting at position (x=0.5, y=-3.5) and ending at (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction DOWN.\n\n### Belt System\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the Iron Ore Extraction and Processing Facility to the Iron Plate Production Facility. It consists of:\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction DOWN.\n  - Status: EMPTY with 75 belts.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a drill failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Full Output Entities\n- Regularly check and empty output entities such as chests and furnaces to avoid blockages. The burner mining drill is unable to continue mining because the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The stone furnace has warnings for no ingredients to smelt and the furnace result being full, indicating a need to manage input and output more effectively.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the item is not available in the inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `drill`: Represents a mining drill entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n  - `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory of resources such as wood, coal, stone, iron ore, and iron plates."}
