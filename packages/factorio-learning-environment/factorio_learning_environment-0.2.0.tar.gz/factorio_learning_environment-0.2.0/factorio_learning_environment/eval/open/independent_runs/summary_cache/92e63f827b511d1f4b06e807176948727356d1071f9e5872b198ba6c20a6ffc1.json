{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) for iron ore storage\n\n### Copper Processing Complex at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill for copper ore at (20.0, 20.0)\n- Stone furnace for smelting at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Complex inserter system:\n  * Input wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n  * Middle wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5)\n  * Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) for copper plates\n- Multiple inserters for material movement:\n  * Mining drill output inserter at (21.5, 21.5)\n  * Furnace input inserter at (22.5, 20.5)\n  * Furnace output inserter at (24.5, 18.5)\n  * Additional support inserters at (20.5, 22.5) and (22.5, 22.5)\n\n### Unused Furnace Setup\nTwo unused stone furnaces at:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new inserters\n- When placing an inserter fails due to occupied space, either:\n  * Choose a different position\n  * Increase the spacing parameter\n  * Change the direction of placement\n\n### Belt Connection Errors\n- Cannot connect belts directly to wooden chests\n- Must use inserters as intermediaries between chests and belts\n- Plan belt layouts to include necessary inserters for chest interactions\n\n### Entity Positioning\n- Verify target positions are clear before attempting to place new entities\n- Consider using different spacing or directions when initial placement fails"}
