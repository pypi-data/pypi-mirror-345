{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\n- **Boilers**: Positioned at (-25.5, 23.0), (-17.5, 24.0), (-28.5, 27.0), (-25.5, 27.0), (-21.5, 27.0), (-24.5, 30.0), and (-28.5, 32.0). These boilers are connected with pipes but have warnings indicating no fluid present in connections.\n- **Offshore Pumps**: Positioned at (-35.5, 36.5), (-33.5, 36.5), (-30.5, 37.5), (-28.5, 36.5), and (-37.5, 38.5). The pump at (-35.5, 36.5) is successfully connected to the steam engine at (-32.5, 32.5) with pipes.\n- **Steam Engine**: Positioned at (-32.5, 32.5), connected to the boiler system with pipes, but not yet operational due to lack of fluid.\n\n### Smelting Facilities\n- **Furnaces**: Two stone furnaces are located at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0). Both furnaces have warnings for no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Laboratory\n- **Lab**: Present but not powered, indicating a lack of connection to the power system.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Pipe Groups**: Multiple pipe groups are present at various positions, such as (-26.5, 11.5), (-14.5, 13.5), (-4.5, 13.5), etc. All pipes are currently empty and not connected to any fluid systems.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group**: Contains poles at various positions like (-0.5, -4.5), (-4.5, -4.5), etc., but the network has a voltage of 0, indicating no power flow.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities such as pipes, boilers, and steam engines. Check inventory for pipes and small electric poles before attempting connections.\n- When connecting offshore pumps, ensure that the connection points are not blocked by other entities. Rearrange entities if necessary to unblock connection points.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Connection Points\n- When connecting boilers or steam engines, ensure that the connection points are not blocked by other entities. Rearrange entities if necessary to unblock connection points.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory\n- Keep track of your inventory to ensure you have enough materials for crafting and placing entities. For example, ensure you have enough pipes and small electric poles before attempting to connect systems.\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into boilers.\n\n### Lab Not Powered\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Craft and place small electric poles to connect the lab to the power system.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Gather necessary raw materials before crafting complex items. For instance, ensure you have enough stone to craft stone furnaces, which are required for crafting boilers.\n- Ensure you have enough resources to craft small electric poles to connect the lab to the power system.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like boilers.\n- Move closer to the target position if the distance is greater than the maximum allowed distance for placement.\n\n### Errors with Repositioning Entities\n- When repositioning entities, ensure you are close enough to the target position. Move closer to the target position if the distance is greater than the maximum allowed distance for placement.\n\n### Errors with Picking Up Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to pick up is present at the specified location. Double-check the position before attempting to pick up an entity.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Manage your inventory to avoid being full, which can prevent inserting items into entities like boilers.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Placement\n- Ensure there is enough space and no existing objects in the way when placing steam engines. Clear the area if necessary before placement.\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is placed in a valid position with no existing objects blocking the connection points. Adjust the placement area to ensure successful connection."}
