{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.5, -51.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -51.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (15 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -51.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Connected to a transport belt at position (-12.5, -51.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Producing: Iron plates (91 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (0.5, -1.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Connected to a transport belt at position (0.5, -2.5)\n\n### Transport System\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the iron ore processing facility to the iron plate production facility\n  - Inputs: Belt from (-13.5, -51.5) to (-11.5, -51.5)\n  - Outputs: Belt from (0.5, -3.5) to (0.5, -1.5)\n  - Status: Empty\n  - Contains 75 belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are part of the mining operations to prevent stoppages. For instance, the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) is full, which halts the mining drill's operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item is available in the inventory before invoking this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **mining_drill**: Represents the mining drill entity, used in conjunction with item insertion operations.\n- **inventory**: A dictionary tracking the current inventory of items such as wood, coal, stone, iron ore, and iron plates."}
