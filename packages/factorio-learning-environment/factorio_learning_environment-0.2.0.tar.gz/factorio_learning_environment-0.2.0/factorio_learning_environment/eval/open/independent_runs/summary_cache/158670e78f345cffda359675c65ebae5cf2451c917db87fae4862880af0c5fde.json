{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with coal as fuel. It is currently operational but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), fueled with coal, responsible for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), fueled with coal. It is not producing iron plates due to a lack of ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Production\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace is currently not producing iron plates because it lacks iron ore. Regularly check and maintain the supply of iron ore to the furnace.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chest\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent the mining drill from halting operations due to a full chest. This will ensure continuous mining and production.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned and fueled. The inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) should be properly positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Ensure it has enough fuel to operate efficiently."}
