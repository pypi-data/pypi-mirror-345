{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5)\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5)\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel supply\n- The burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0) repeatedly reported \"NO_FUEL\". Ensure that the burner mining drill is consistently supplied with coal to maintain its operation.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for items\n- The burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) is often in a \"WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\" state. Check the supply chain to ensure that the inserter has access to the necessary items to function properly.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for space\n- The burner inserter at position (43.5, -81.5) is frequently in a \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" state. Verify that the destination (wooden chest) has enough space to receive items from the inserter.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int (current inventory of coal)\n- `wood`: int (current inventory of wood)\n- `iron-plate`: int (inventory in stone furnace)"}
