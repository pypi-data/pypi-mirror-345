If no electric poles are nearby, craft and place one.\n- **Resource Supply**: Check and supply the furnace with the necessary copper ore and coal to produce copper plates.\n- **Monitoring and Extraction**: Continuously monitor the furnace's output and extract copper plates once they are available.\n- **Insertion into Assembling Machine**: Move the extracted copper plates to the assembling machine to enable production.\n\n### Tips:\n- **Logging**: Ensure that each step logs its actions and results. This helps in diagnosing issues if the expected outcomes are not achieved.\n- **Assertions**: Use assertions or checks to confirm the presence of entities and resources before attempting operations.\n- **Error Handling**: Catch and log exceptions to understand where the process might be failing.", "summary_range": "[1-342]"}
