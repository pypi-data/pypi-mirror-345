After smelting, we should have enough iron plates to craft the Assembling Machine.\n\nLet's proceed to smelt the 5 iron ore we just gathered into iron plates.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Insert the gathered iron ore into the stone furnace for smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, existing_furnace, quantity=5)  # Add the gathered iron ore into the furnace\n\n# Check the updated inventory after inserting iron ore into the furnace\nprint(f\"Inventory after inserting iron ore into the furnace: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory after inserting iron ore", "summary_range": "[1-202]"}
