{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nLocated at positions:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n\n**Structure Description:**\n- The **Burner Mining Drill** extracts iron ore and deposits it into the **Wooden Chest**.\n- The **Burner Inserter** is responsible for transferring iron ore from the **Wooden Chest** to the **Stone Furnace**.\n- The **Stone Furnace** is intended to smelt the iron ore into iron plates, but it is currently not receiving iron ore due to an issue with the inserter setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. The repeated repositioning of the inserter suggests alignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to refuel the inserter and mining drill. Running out of fuel can halt operations.\n\n### Errors with Crafting Raw Resources\n- Coal cannot be crafted as it is a raw resource that must be gathered. Ensure to gather coal directly from coal deposits.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can stop the mining drill from operating.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace receives the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inserter setup and ensure that it is functioning correctly to supply the furnace with iron ore."}
