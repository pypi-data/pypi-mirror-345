{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is designed to extract iron ore and process it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and outputs it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and aligned to pick up items from the chest and drop them into the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates a persistent alignment problem.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to transfer iron ore to the furnace. Check the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they are set correctly.\n\n### Fuel Management for Entities\n- Regularly refuel the burner inserter and furnace to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that coal is adequately supplied to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Chest Capacity Management\n- Monitor the chest's capacity to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly extract iron ore from the chest to free up space.\n\n### Warning: No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Address the warning on the stone furnace indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" by ensuring that iron ore is being successfully transferred from the chest to the furnace."}
