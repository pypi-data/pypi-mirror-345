{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron plate mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore from nearby patch\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the chest\n\nThis structure forms a compact iron plate production line, where ore is mined, smelted, and output stored in a chest. The burner inserter facilitates transfer between furnace and chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Errors placing inserter next to occupied tile\n- When placing the burner inserter next to the furnace at (16.0, 73.0), placement failed due to the wooden chest occupying the intended tile at (17.5, 73.0).\n- To avoid this, increase spacing when placing inserters, change placement direction, or adjust reference position to ensure no entity collision.\n\n###Errors extracting from drill drop position with no valid entity\n- Multiple extraction attempts from drill drop position (16.5, 72.5) failed because no valid iron ore entity was found at that location.\n- Ensure the drop position of the mining drill aligns correctly with the furnace or chest to accept mined ore, or adjust entity positions to avoid output blockage.\n\n###NameError due to undefined variable\n- A NameError occurred referencing an undefined variable `extracted_ore`.\n- Always define and initialize variables before use; verify variable names for typos or scoping issues.\n\n###Inserter waiting for source items warning\n- The burner inserter at (18.5, 73.5) repeatedly showed status waiting for source items, indicating no ore available to move.\n- This is caused by output blockage or misalignment between drill drop position and furnace input.\n- Fix entity placement to ensure smooth item flow from drill to furnace to inserter.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions detected in the provided steps."}
