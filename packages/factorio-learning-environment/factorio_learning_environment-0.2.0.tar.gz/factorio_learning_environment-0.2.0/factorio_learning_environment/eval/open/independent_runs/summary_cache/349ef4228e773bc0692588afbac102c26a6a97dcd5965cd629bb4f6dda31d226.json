{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) - Status: WORKING\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine, with sections at positions (-5.5, 16.5) and (-8.5, 23.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Electricity group at position (-5.4, 20.0) - Status: NOT PLUGGED IN ELECTRIC NETWORK\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace - Status: NO INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors between Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that the expected pipe paths are clear and that the correct type of pipes are used.\n\n### Fuel Management for Boiler\n- Regularly check and ensure that the boiler has sufficient fuel to maintain operation. Harvest and insert coal as needed.\n\n### Inventory Management for Crafting and Placement\n- Before attempting to place entities like small electric poles, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory. Craft necessary items if they are not present.\n\n### Electricity Network Connection\n- Ensure that the electricity group is properly connected to the electric network. Place and connect electric poles to extend the network as needed.\n\n### Entity Placement and Obstacle Management\n- Inspect the area for obstacles before placing entities to ensure there is sufficient space and no conflicts with existing structures."}
