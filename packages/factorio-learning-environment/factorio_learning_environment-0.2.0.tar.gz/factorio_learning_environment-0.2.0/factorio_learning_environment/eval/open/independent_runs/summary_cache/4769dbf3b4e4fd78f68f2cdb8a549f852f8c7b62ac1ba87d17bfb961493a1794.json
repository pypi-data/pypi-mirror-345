Consider adjusting the spacing or changing the direction to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with incorrect spacing or direction\n- Review the placement parameters, such as spacing and direction, to ensure they are appropriate for the intended position. Adjust them if necessary to accommodate existing structures and avoid placement errors."}
