If ingredients are stored remotely (e.g., in a chest), extract them into the inventory prior to crafting.\n- Entity Placement Collisions:\n  - When placing a furnace adjacent to an existing structure (using a reference such as the storage chest), ensure the target tile is unoccupied. Adjust parameters such as spacing and placement direction to avoid collisions. In this case, initial attempts with spacing 0 or 1 in the UP direction conflicted with an already placed furnace, while switching to the RIGHT direction with spacing 1 resolved the placement issue."}
