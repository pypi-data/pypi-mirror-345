{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, y=-123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, y=-121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, y=-117.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities, starting at position (-47.5, y=-122.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, y=-73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, y=-64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, y=-62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, y=-60.5) connected to a small electric pole at position (5.5, y=-60.5)\n\n### Storage and Processing Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, y=-61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, y=-59.5)\n- Lab at position (electrical_id=279730)\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple Pipe Groups are present, with notable positions:\n- Pipe Group at position (-50.5, y=-122.5)\n- Pipe Group at position (-47.5, y=-122.5) with water\n- Various other Pipe Groups at different positions indicating an extensive network\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of small electric poles connecting various entities, with notable positions:\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=25.5, y=7.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=30.5, y=6.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe entities are available in the inventory before attempting to place them at specific positions. The error indicates that the specified positions do not have the required pipe entities.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to a functional power network and that it is receiving the necessary input liquid. The assertion error indicates that the steam engine is not generating power, likely due to incorrect connections or lack of input fluid.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established and that there is fluid present in the connections. The boiler and steam engine warnings indicate missing fluid connections, which are essential for operation."}
