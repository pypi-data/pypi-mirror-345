Multiple recovery updates attempted to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for research purposes, but all lab placement or crafting operations failed due to missing inventory items and insufficient sub-ingredients. In parallel, the agent interacted with existing furnaces to process raw materials:\n\u2022 An alternative furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) was used for smelting iron plates.\n\u2022 A copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) was used for copper plate production.\nThese furnace interactions served processing purposes only and did not result in new structure placement (the final entities on the map remain None).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage:\n  \u2013 When calling get_entities, use the prescribed function signature. Avoid providing unexpected keywords (e.g. remove the 'radius' keyword) and extra positional arguments to prevent type errors.\n  \n\u2022 Iteration on API Results:\n  \u2013 Validate that API calls return an iterable (e.g. ensure the returned value is not None) before attempting to iterate over the list of entities. Use a fallback to an empty list if necessary.\n  \n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Verification:\n  \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab (or any structure), verify that the corresponding item is present in the inventory to avoid placement errors.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting Resource Checks:\n  \u2013 Prior to initiating lab crafting, confirm that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are sufficiently available. Ensure that prerequisite processes (like smelting sufficient iron and copper plates) have been completed successfully to support the full crafting chain.\n\n"}
