{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace at position (5.0, -73.0).\n  \n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position (5.0, -73.0) to assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Assembling machines and steam engines are not receiving power. Ensure that electric poles are properly connected to these entities to provide the necessary electricity.\n- Check that the steam engine is connected to a boiler and that the boiler has water supplied from an offshore pump.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities in the intended placement area.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
