{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to multiple wooden chests\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=42.5, y=-83.5), (x=43.5, y=-83.5), and (x=44.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) with iron plates as output\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0) with iron plates as output\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) storing various items including stone bricks and coal\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=62.5, y=-53.5) and (x=65.5, y=-52.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups connecting various positions:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=45.5, y=-82.5) to (x=48.5, y=-79.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=63.5, y=-50.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=42.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.5, y=-46.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=44.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.5, y=-54.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=49.5, y=-80.5) to (x=60.5, y=-69.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=49.5, y=-78.5) to (x=58.5, y=-69.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=50.5, y=-79.5) to (x=59.5, y=-70.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=59.5, y=-68.5) to (x=67.5, y=-54.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Issues\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to pick up items from chests. Consider crafting or placing items to free up space.\n\n### Errors with Underground Belt Connections\n- Verify the path and ensure it is valid and clear before attempting to connect underground belts. Check for obstacles or incorrect positioning that may prevent successful connections.\n\n### Temporary Chest Placement Failures\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them. In this case, ensure wooden chests are available before placement.\n\n### Undefined Variables\n- Define all necessary variables before use. Ensure that 'temporary_chest' is defined before attempting to insert items into it.\n\n### Resource Availability\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources, such as wood, before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions or important variables were defined in the provided logs. Ensure to define and document any utility functions or important variables for better code management and debugging."}
