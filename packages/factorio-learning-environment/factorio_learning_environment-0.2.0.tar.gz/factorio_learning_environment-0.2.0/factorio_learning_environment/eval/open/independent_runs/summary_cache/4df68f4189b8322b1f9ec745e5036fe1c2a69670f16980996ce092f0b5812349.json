{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Copper Plate Output System at Position (-17.5, -69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-17.5, -69.5) for receiving copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-16.5, -69.5) transferring items into the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. In this case, a wooden chest could not be placed due to an obstruction by a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position is correctly aligned with the intended receiving entity. If no entity is found at the drop position, consider placing a suitable container or adjusting the inserter's position.\n\n### General Tips for Entity Management\n- Regularly check the status of inserters and ensure they are not waiting for source items unnecessarily. Adjust the supply chain to maintain a steady flow of resources."}
