This network processes raw ores into plates.\n\u2022 Stone Furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=0.0) similarly equipped.\n(Note: Although additional iron plate extraction was performed from the furnace at (0.0, 0.0), the network\u2019s structure remains unchanged.)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A burner\u2010mining drill (with its associated mining components) connected to a wooden chest and interlinked by transport belts for collecting iron ore.\n  \n### Automation Research Lab\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A laboratory receiving automation\u2010science-pack inputs, supported by a network of small electric poles to maintain power.\n\n### Water Supply System for Power Generation with Updated Steam Engine Placement\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A Boiler at Position(x=8.0, y=20.5) with connection points at Position(x=8.5, y=18.5) and Position(x=8.5, y=22.5); its fluid box holds 200 units of water.\n\u2022 An Offshore Pump at Position(x=0.5, y=30.5).\n\u2022 Pre\u2010existing Steam Engines at Positions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (1.5, 13.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (13.5, 14.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (19.5, 14.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (13.5, 17.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (17.5, 20.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (11.5, 20.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (22.5, 18.5)\n\u2022 An additional Steam Engine was crafted and placed at Position(x=4.5, y=23.5) (Steps 409/414) to enhance network connectivity; however, repeated attempts to connect it via pipes to the Boiler have failed.\n\u2022 Multiple PipeGroups are deployed to route fluids. Recently, 8 new Pipe units were crafted for connection purposes, but integration with the newly placed engine remains unresolved.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Pipe Connection Failures\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the candidate connection areas (for both the Boiler and Steam Engine) are clear of obstructions and within a buildable zone.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that sufficient pipe inventory is available before initiating connection commands (e.g. \u201cRequired number \u2013 8, Available \u2013 0\u201d indicates a shortage).\n\n\u2022 Repositioning and Entity Placement Issues\n\u2003\u2013 Undefined function errors (e.g. \u201cshift_entity is not defined\u201d) indicate missing utility function definitions; ensure all helper functions for repositioning are properly defined and used.\n\u2003\u2013 Attribute errors during rotation (such as a string being used where an object is expected) require verifying the data type of the entity parameter before calling transformation methods.\n\u2003\u2013 Placement failures due to terrain obstacles (such as water or other blocking entities) necessitate pre-checking the target area\u2019s buildability.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and Resource Shortages\n\u2003\u2013 Insufficient resource errors (for instance, being unable to insert coal into a furnace or failing to craft pipes due to missing iron-plate sub-ingredients) highlight the need to ensure production chains and inventory levels are adequate before executing craft commands.\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor and maintain the supply of critical intermediate items (like iron plates) to support dependent crafting operations.\n\n\u2022 General Connection Issues\n\u2003\u2013 When connections between entities (such as from the Boiler to a Steam Engine) repeatedly fail, re-assess both the positional alignment and surrounding environment for potential blockages, and adjust entity placement accordingly."}
