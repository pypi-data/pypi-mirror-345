{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\nLocated around position (8.5, 13.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine-1 at (8.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear input:\n  - Iron gear chest at (8.5, 8.5)\n  - Burner inserter at (8.5, 9.5)\n- Copper plate input:\n  - Copper chest at (8.5, 18.5) containing 9 copper plates\n  - Burner inserter at (8.5, 17.5)\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter at (10.5, 13.5)\n  - Wooden chest at (11.5, 13.5)\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-4.5, 16.0), consists of:\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 16.0) with coal fuel\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by pipe networks (fluid systems 3290, 3298)\n- Electric pole network connecting power consumers\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple locations with similar setups:\n1. At (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output inserter at (-23.5, -58.5)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n2. At (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output inserter at (-13.5, -50.5)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\n3. At (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n### Transport System\nBelt network starting at (8.5, 11.5) and ending at (1.5, 14.5), consisting of 11 belts\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - multiple attempts to place chests and inserters where other entities already exist\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, verify the target position is clear and adjust spacing or direction if needed\n- Pay attention to entity dimensions - some entities like furnaces and assembling machines take up multiple tiles\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Ensure proper spacing between inserters and their target entities\n- Configure inserter pickup and drop positions to avoid conflicts with other entities\n- When inserters show \"waiting for space in destination\", ensure there is a valid output location\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep mining drills fueled - multiple drills are showing \"out of fuel\" warnings\n- Ensure proper fuel supply to all burner entities\n- Monitor chest inventories to prevent bottlenecks in production\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- When building automated production lines, plan the layout considering the space requirements of all components\n- Ensure proper spacing between input, processing, and output components\n- Consider the direction and orientation of inserters and machines for optimal material flow"}
