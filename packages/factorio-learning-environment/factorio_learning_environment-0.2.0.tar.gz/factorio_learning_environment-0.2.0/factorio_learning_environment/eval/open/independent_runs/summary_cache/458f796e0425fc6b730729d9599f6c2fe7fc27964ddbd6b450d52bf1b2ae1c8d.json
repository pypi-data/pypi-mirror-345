{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) which is currently working and processing iron ore.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) which is out of fuel and has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (41.5, -80.5) is full.\n- Wooden chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) which contains 280 coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace repeatedly without checking fuel status:**\n  - Ensure that the furnace has enough fuel before inserting items. The burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) is out of fuel, which may affect the supply of iron ore.\n  \n- **Errors related to full chests:**\n  - The burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) cannot continue mining because the chest at (41.5, -80.5) is full. Regularly check and empty chests to avoid interruptions in mining operations.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked during the execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: Inventory"}
