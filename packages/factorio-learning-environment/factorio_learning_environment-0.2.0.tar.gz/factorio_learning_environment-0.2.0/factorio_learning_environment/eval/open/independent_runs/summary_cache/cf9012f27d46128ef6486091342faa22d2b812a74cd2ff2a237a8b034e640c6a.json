This furnace supports the production process for generating additional iron plates needed for subsequent crafting chains.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at position(-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a single furnace entity used for smelting copper ore (with coal) into copper plates. The copper plates produced here are intended for further conversion into copper cables to help meet resource requirements for lab crafting.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 When calling get_entities, use the correct signature. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as 'radius') and verify the expected number of positional parameters to prevent type errors.\n\n\u2022 Before iterating over the result from get_entities, ensure that it is a valid iterable. Using a fallback (for example, defaulting to an empty list) will help avoid issues with NoneType objects.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting and placement failures are recurring. Review the complete resource chain and verify that all sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available in sufficient quantities before attempting to craft or place a Lab. Also confirm that a Lab exists in the inventory prior to placement to avoid errors at the target location.\n\n\u2022 Ensure that resource conversion (via smelting operations such as for iron plates and copper plates) is fully completed and that inventories are updated accordingly before triggering lab-related production steps."}
