{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System at position (-80.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two furnaces at positions (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\n- Both furnaces are fueled with 50 coal each\n- Transport belt system carrying coal and iron ore\n- Two burner inserters at positions (44.5, -83.5) and (46.5, -83.5)\n  - Configured to pick up from (y=-82.5) and drop at (y=-84.5)\n\nThe system appears to be a smelting setup for processing iron ore, with transport belts feeding materials and inserters managing item movement.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Conflicts with Existing Entities\n- Multiple attempts to place inserters failed due to existing objects blocking the target location\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Consider using different offset positions when original placement fails\n\n### Inserter Positioning Issues\n- Several attempts to position inserters relative to furnaces and belts failed\n- Ensure proper spacing between components (belts, furnaces, inserters)\n- Verify that inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended source and destination points\n\n### System Design Considerations\n- Current inserter configuration shows WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS status\n- Ensure transport belt layout properly feeds materials to inserter pickup positions\n- Verify that inserter rotation and position allows proper access to both source and destination points\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- input_inserter1: Entity (burner-inserter)\n- input_inserter2: Entity (burner-inserter)\n\n### System State\n- Furnaces: NO_INGREDIENTS status\n- Inserters: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS status\n- Belt Contents: Mixed coal and iron-ore distribution\n\nNo utility functions were defined in the provided logs."}
