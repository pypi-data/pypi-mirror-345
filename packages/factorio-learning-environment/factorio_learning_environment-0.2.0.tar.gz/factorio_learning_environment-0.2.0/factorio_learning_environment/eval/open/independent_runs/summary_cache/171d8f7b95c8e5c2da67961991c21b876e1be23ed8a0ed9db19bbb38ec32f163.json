{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) for copper plate production\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0) for additional copper plate production\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for iron plate production\n\n### Research Lab at Position (10.5, -4.5)\n- Lab connected to the power network\n- Currently researching Electronics with automation science packs\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (19.5, -12.5) for fluid distribution\n- PipeGroup at position (4.5, -9.5) with water fluid\n- PipeGroup at position (19.5, -2.5) with water fluid\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at multiple positions including (10.5, -10.5), (21.5, -14.5), (23.5, -12.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target location is clear of obstacles before attempting to place an entity. The error at step 45 indicates an obstruction when trying to place a lab at (12.5, -4.5).\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel and Power\n- Ensure that boilers and furnaces are adequately fueled to maintain operation. The boiler at position (20.5, -4.0) is out of fuel, and furnaces are missing ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Connection\n- Verify that all components requiring power are properly connected to the electricity network. The steam engine at position (22.5, -7.5) is not receiving electricity due to no fluid present in connections.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be improved."}
