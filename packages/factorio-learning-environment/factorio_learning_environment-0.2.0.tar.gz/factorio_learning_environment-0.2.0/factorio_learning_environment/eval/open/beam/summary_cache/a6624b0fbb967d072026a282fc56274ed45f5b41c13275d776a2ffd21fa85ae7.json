{"content": "I notice a pattern in my attempts - the inserter keeps getting placed at (-11.5, y=27.5) regardless of the requested position (-10.5, y=28.5). Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\nKey Observations:\n1. The inserter consistently places at (-11.5, 27.5) regardless of requested position\n2. The furnace is at (-10.0, 29.0)\n3. The belt output is at (-10.5, 28.5)\n4. Direction changes aren't fixing the positioning issue\n\nLet me try a different approach:\n\n```python\n# First clean up existing inserters\npickup_entity(Prototype.BurnerInserter, Position(x=-11.5, y=27.5))\n\n# Try placing at the furnace's input side\nmove_to(Position(x=-10.0, y=28.0))  # Move closer to furnace\n\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=Position(x=-10.0, y=28.0),  # Try placing directly adjacent to furnace\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT  # Try a different initial direction\n)\n\nif inserter:\n    # Add fuel\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n    print(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n    print(f\"Pickup position: {inserter.pickup_position}\")\n    print(f\"Drop position: {inserter.drop_position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Updated entity status: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis attempt focuses on placing relative to the furnace position rather than the belt position. Let's see if this helps with the positioning issue.", "summary_range": "[1-432]"}
