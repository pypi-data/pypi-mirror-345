{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (53.5, -78.5) and (55.5, -78.5) for further coal management.\n- Wooden Chest at position (54.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-11.5, -48.5), (-8.5, -48.5), (-9.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -46.5) managing the transfer of materials between entities.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) storing various resources including iron ore, iron plates, and wood.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have available items to transfer. This can be resolved by checking the inventory of the source entities and ensuring they are not empty.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- The burner mining drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) indicates that the chest at its drop position is full. Regularly check and empty the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of various items such as 'wooden-chest', 'burner-inserter', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'. Current values: {'wooden-chest': 2, 'burner-inserter': 5, 'wood': 2, 'coal': 1126, 'iron-ore': 475, 'iron-plate': 927}."}
