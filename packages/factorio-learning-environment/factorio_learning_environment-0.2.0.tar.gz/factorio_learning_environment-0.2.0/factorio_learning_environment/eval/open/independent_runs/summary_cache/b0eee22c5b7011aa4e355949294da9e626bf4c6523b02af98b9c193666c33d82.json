{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, including multiple pipes at positions such as (20.5, -10.5), (21.5, -10.5), (22.5, -10.5), (24.5, -10.5), etc.\n- Small Electric Pole at position (24.5, -7.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (not specified) with a status of missing science packs\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position (-3.5, 1.5) with a status of no power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a lab\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a lab. In this case, make sure to have automation science packs available before trying to insert them.\n\n### Errors with inserters not receiving power\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a power source. Ensure that small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to provide electricity to the inserters.\n\n### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Check that the input resources are available and correctly fed into the furnaces."}
