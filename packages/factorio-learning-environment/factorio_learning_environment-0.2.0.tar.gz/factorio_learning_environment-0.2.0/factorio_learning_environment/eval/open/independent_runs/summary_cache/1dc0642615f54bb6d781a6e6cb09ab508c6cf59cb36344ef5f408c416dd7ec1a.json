{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (0,0) to (6,4)\nConsists of four stone furnaces for smelting iron:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0)\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) \n- Furnace 3 at (4,4)\n- Furnace 4 at (6,4)\nAll furnaces have coal fuel and iron plate output storage\n\n### Copper Smelting Area at (0,4)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting copper:\n- Copper Furnace 1 at (0,4)\n- Copper Furnace 2 at (2,4)\nBoth furnaces have coal fuel and copper plate output storage\n\n### Research Lab at (8.5,0.5)\nSingle lab structure loaded with automation science packs but currently unpowered\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,19.5)\nIncomplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,24.5) for water input\n- Boiler at (-9.5,23.0) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at (-9.5,19.5)\nComponents are placed but not properly connected with pipes/fluid system\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check if target location is clear and terrain is suitable before placing entities\n- Steam engines cannot be placed on water tiles\n- Ensure you have the required entity in inventory before attempting placement\n\n### Resource/Item Availability Errors\n- Verify required items are in inventory before inserting into entities\n- When crafting complex items, ensure all sub-components can be crafted or are available\n- For automated crafting (like copper plates), ensure proper production facilities exist\n\n### Connection/Fluid System Errors\n- Power generation components (pump, boiler, steam engine) need proper pipe connections\n- Ensure entities that need to be connected are properly aligned and within connection range\n- Use appropriate connection entities (pipes) between fluid-carrying structures\n\n### Type Operation Errors\n- Building box dimensions calculation needs proper type handling for entity dimensions\n- Avoid direct operations on model attributes without proper type conversion\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Lab requires power to function - ensure power generation system is complete and connected\n- Steam engine needs proper fluid input connections to generate power"}
