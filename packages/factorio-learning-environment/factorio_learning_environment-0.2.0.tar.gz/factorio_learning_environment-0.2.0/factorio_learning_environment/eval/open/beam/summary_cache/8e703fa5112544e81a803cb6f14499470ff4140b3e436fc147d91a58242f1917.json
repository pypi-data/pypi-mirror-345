{"content": "### Execution Result Report\n\n#### Overview of Attempt\nThe agent attempted to locate iron ore and copper ore patches at the coordinates (-300, 300). However, the execution resulted in an error indicating that no resources of the specified type were found at that location.\n\n#### Error Details\n- **Error Message**: \n  - \"Could not get iron-ore at x=-300.0 y=300.0: No resource of type iron-ore at the specified location.\"\n- **Line of Error**: The error occurred specifically at the line where the agent attempted to retrieve the iron ore patch using the `get_resource_patch` function.\n\n#### Summary of Actions\n1. **Positioning**: The agent moved to the coordinates (-300, 300) to search for resources.\n2. **Resource Retrieval Attempts**: The agent attempted to retrieve both iron ore and copper ore resources at the specified position.\n3. **Error Handling**: The attempt to retrieve the iron ore resulted in an exception, indicating that the search was unsuccessful.\n\n#### Recommendations for Future Actions\n1. **Broaden Search Parameters**: Since the search at (-300, 300) yielded no results, consider exploring even further away from previously checked coordinates. For instance, try positions like (-400, 400) or (400, -400).\n   \n2. **Utilize a Grid Search Pattern**: Instead of checking random coordinates, implement a systematic grid search pattern. This could involve checking every coordinate in a defined range (e.g., checking every 50 units within a certain area).\n\n3. **Check Resource Availability**: If possible, check the map or game settings to understand the distribution of resources. This can help in identifying areas that are more likely to contain iron or copper.\n\n4. **Error Logging**: Implement error logging to keep track of all failed attempts. This can help in identifying patterns or specific areas that consistently yield no results.\n\n5. **Revisit Previous Locations**: If the agent has not found resources in a while, consider revisiting previously checked locations with a different approach or after some time, as resource generation may change.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe agent's attempt to locate iron ore and copper resources at (-300, 300) was unsuccessful, leading to an error. By broadening the search area, employing a systematic exploration strategy, and keeping track of previous attempts, the agent may improve the chances of finding the necessary resources for crafting and production in the Factorio environment.", "summary_range": "[1-482]"}
