{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (15.5,72.5) storing iron ore (currently contains 15 iron ore)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at (-46.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (-46.5,70.5) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-46.5,72.5) storing copper ore (currently contains 16 copper ore)\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,-0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,-0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-5.0,-0.5) converting water to steam (currently has coal fuel)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5,-0.5) generating electricity\n- Pipe network connecting the components (currently not fully functional)\n\n### Iron Smelting Operation at (16.0,71.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0,71.0) extracting iron ore (fueled with coal, output blocked)\n- Wooden chest at (16.5,72.5) storing iron ore (contains 2 iron ore)\n- Burner inserter at (19.5,70.5) (waiting for source items)\n- Burner inserter at (21.5,70.5) (waiting for source items)\n- Wooden chest at (22.5,70.5) (empty)\n- Stone furnace at (20.0,70.0) (no ingredients to smelt)\n\n### Copper Mining Operation at (-46.0,71.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-46.0,71.0) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-46.5,72.5) storing copper ore\n\n### Smelting Setups\n- Stone furnace at (100.0,100.0) with wooden chest at (98.5,100.5) (no ingredients)\n- Stone furnace at (300.0,300.0) with wooden chest at (298.5,300.5) (no ingredients)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Repeated Burner Inserter Placement Failures\n- Multiple failed attempts to place burner inserter at (19.0,70.0) due to existing objects\n- Verify target position is clear before placing (steps 88, 90, 92, 95)\n- Consider alternative positions or remove existing objects first\n\n### Belt Connection Errors\n- Repeated attempts to connect belts directly to wooden chests (steps 89, 91, 94)\n- Always use inserters between chests and belts\n- Verify inserter placement and orientation before belt connections\n\n### Undefined Module Errors\n- Attempt to use undefined 'random' module (step 93)\n- Import required modules before use\n- Verify all referenced names are defined\n\n### Existing Issues from Previous Report\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0,71.0) still has output blocked\n- Multiple furnaces remain without ingredients (100.0,100.0, 300.0,300.0)\n- Power system still not fully functional\n- Continue addressing these persistent issues\n\n### Entity Placement Best Practices\n- Always check for existing entities before placement\n- Maintain proper spacing between components\n- Verify terrain suitability (not water or occupied tiles)"}
