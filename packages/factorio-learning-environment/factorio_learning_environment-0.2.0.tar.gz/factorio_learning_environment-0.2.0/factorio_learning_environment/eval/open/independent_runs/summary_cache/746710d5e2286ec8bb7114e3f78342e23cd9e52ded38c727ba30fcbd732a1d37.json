{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) which is currently full of iron plates. It has iron ore as the source and coal as fuel.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0), fueled with coal, facing downwards. The drill is currently waiting for space in the destination as its output is blocked.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5), fueled with coal, facing right. It is waiting for source items due to a full chest.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting positions (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5), with a direction change to left at (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5). The belt group is empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the intended position before attempting to place entities like Wooden Chests or extending transport belts.\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Make sure there is a sink entity or enough space to accept the output from entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with full output\n- Regularly clear the output of entities like Stone Furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities have items available for inserters to pick up, and that the destination is not full, to avoid waiting statuses."}
