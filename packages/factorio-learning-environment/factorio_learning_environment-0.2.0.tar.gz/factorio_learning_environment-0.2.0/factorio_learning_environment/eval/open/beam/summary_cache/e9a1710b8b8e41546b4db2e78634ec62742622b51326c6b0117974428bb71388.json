We should insert the 10 iron ore into the first furnace to resume its operation.\n2. Monitor the second furnace until it finishes processing its remaining iron ore.\n\nLet's proceed to insert the iron ore into the first furnace and check its status afterward.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Insert 10 iron ore into the first furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace_1_position, quantity=10)\n\n# Check the inventory and furnace status after insertion\nprint(f\"Inventory after inserting iron ore: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-164]"}
