We need to gather more iron ore to keep both furnaces operational.\n2. After gathering, we can distribute iron ore to both furnaces to maximize production.\n\nLet's proceed to gather more iron ore from the nearest resource patch. We'll aim for another 10 iron ore to ensure both furnaces can operate efficiently.\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1. Find the nearest iron ore position again\niron_ore_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\n\n# 2.
