{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) waiting for source items, transferring coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal to another location.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5) and outputs from Belt at position (x=43.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transporting coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
