{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position(-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position(-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input, producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position(-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input, producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position(-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input, producing iron plates.\n- Iron chests at various positions for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at position(4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(4.0, -60.0) fueled by coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chests at positions(4.5, -58.5) and (5.5, -60.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing resources are not full to prevent interruptions in mining and production processes. Regularly check and empty chests to maintain workflow.\n\n### Errors with Chest Placement\n- Verify that chests are placed correctly and have sufficient capacity for the intended storage needs. Consider upgrading to larger chests if necessary.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n- Utility functions and variables are not explicitly defined in the logs provided. However, the agent is managing inventories and entities effectively, indicating a potential use of utility functions for these tasks.\n- Important variables include:\n  - `coal`: int, representing the amount of coal available for fueling drills and furnaces.\n  - `iron-ore`: int, representing the amount of iron ore available for processing.\n  - `iron-plate`: int, representing the amount of iron plates produced and stored."}
