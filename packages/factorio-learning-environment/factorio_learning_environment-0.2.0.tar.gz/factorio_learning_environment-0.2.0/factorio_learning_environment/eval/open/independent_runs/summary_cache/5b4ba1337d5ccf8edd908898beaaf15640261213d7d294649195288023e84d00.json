{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Area\nConsists of two furnaces working in parallel:\n- Furnace 1 at position(0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and copper ore input\n- Furnace 2 at position(2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and copper ore input\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area\n- Furnace 3 at position(4.0, 4.0) processing iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Electronic Circuit Production Line\n- Input chest at position(6.5, 11.5) containing iron plates and copper cables\n- Burner inserter at position(7.5, 11.5) moving items from input chest to assembling machine\n- Assembling machine at position(9.5, 11.5) crafting electronic circuits\n- Burner inserter at position(11.5, 11.5) moving finished circuits to output chest\n- Output chest at position(12.5, 11.5) storing electronic circuits\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Pipe network connecting water from pump to boiler (positions: -9.5/23.5, -8.5/23.5, -8.5/22.5, -7.5/22.5)\n- Boiler at position(-7.0, 24.5) converting water to steam\n- Steam pipe network (positions: -5.5/24.5, -5.5/25.5, -5.5/26.5)\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Electricity distribution network connecting multiple poles across the map\n\n### Science Pack Storage and Research\n- Lab facilities with automation and logistic science pack inputs\n- Storage chest at position(0.5, 31.5) containing science packs\n- Burner inserter at position(0.5, 30.5) feeding science packs to lab\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Technology Research Errors\n- Cannot research technologies that are already researched (electronics, automation-2, steel-processing)\n- Cannot research technologies without prerequisites (advanced-electronics needs plastics, electric-engine needs lubricant)\n- Several invalid technology names used: FluidHandling, EngineUnit, ElectricEngine, ElectricEngineUnit, Engine\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Attempting to insert coal when inventory is empty - check inventory before attempting insertions\n\n### Production Issues\n- Electronic circuit production stalled due to missing copper cable ingredients - ensure steady supply of materials"}
