There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.']\n  - Resources: [Ingredient(name='coal', count=40000, type=None)]\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 0.5)\n  - Status: EntityStatus.NORMAL\n  - Inventory: Inventory({})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chest\n- Ensure the intended position for placing the Wooden Chest is not occupied by another entity or object. Verify the tile is buildable before attempting to place the chest.\n\n### Errors due to invalid input types for building dimensions\n- When specifying dimensions for building entities, ensure that the inputs are valid integers. Avoid using non-integer types such as strings or objects.\n\n### Errors due to invalid callable objects\n- Ensure that objects like 'Position' are used correctly and are not mistakenly treated as callable functions.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- For mining drills, ensure there is a clear path for the output. Place a sink entity, such as a conveyor belt or chest, to receive the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage warnings."}
