{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Pipe Group at position (-12.5, 21.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Pipes connecting from (x=-12.5, y=21.5) to (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Group at position (-4.115, 20.167)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric poles at various positions, not plugged into the electric network\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Stone furnace with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing structures in unsuitable positions\n- Ensure that the terrain is suitable for placing offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines. Verify the terrain compatibility before attempting to place these entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes and entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are correctly aligned and within reach. Check the connection path to avoid failed connections.\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles\n- Verify that electric poles are placed in unobstructed positions and are within connection range of each other to ensure a complete electric network.\n\n### Errors when using pickup_entity function\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that the second argument is a Position object to avoid ValueError.\n\n### Errors when finding suitable positions for offshore pumps\n- Conduct a thorough search for suitable positions for offshore pumps, considering the water source and terrain compatibility.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Before placing any entity, ensure the tile is not obstructed by other entities or unsuitable terrain to prevent placement failures."}
