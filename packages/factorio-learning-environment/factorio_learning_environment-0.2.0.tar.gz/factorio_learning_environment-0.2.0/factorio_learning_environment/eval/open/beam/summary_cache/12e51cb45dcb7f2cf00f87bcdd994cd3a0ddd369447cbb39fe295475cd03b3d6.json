{"content": "Ah, I see the issue. We're trying to craft iron gear wheels but we need iron plates first, and those need to be smelted. Let's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# We'll work with whatever transport belts we already have\n# Get our reference positions\ndrill_pos = drill.position\nfurnace_pos = furnace1.position\n\n# Start at the drill\nmove_to(drill_pos)\ncurrent_pos = drill.drop_position\n\n# Function to ensure we're close enough to place entities\ndef ensure_in_range(target_pos):\n    \"\"\"Move close to target position if we're too far\"\"\"\n    move_to(target_pos)\n    return target_pos\n\n# Let's try to place just a few critical belts to connect drill to furnace\n# First, place one belt right after the drill\nnext_pos = Position(x=current_pos.x + 1, y=current_pos.y)\nnext_pos = ensure_in_range(next_pos)\nbelt = place_entity(Prototype.TransportBelt, position=next_pos)\nassert belt, f\"Failed to place belt at {next_pos}\"\ncurrent_pos = next_pos\n\n# Place one belt to get closer to furnace\nnext_pos = Position(x=current_pos.x, y=furnace_pos.y + 1)\nnext_pos = ensure_in_range(next_pos)\nbelt = place_entity(Prototype.TransportBelt, position=next_pos)\nassert belt, f\"Failed to place belt at {next_pos}\"\ncurrent_pos = next_pos\n\n# Place final belt in front of furnace\nfinal_belt_pos = Position(x=furnace_pos.x, y=furnace_pos.y + 1)\nmove_to(final_belt_pos)\nfinal_belt = place_entity(Prototype.TransportBelt, position=final_belt_pos)\nassert final_belt, \"Failed to place final belt\"\n\n# Place inserter\ninserter_pos = Position(x=furnace_pos.x, y=furnace_pos.y + 1)\nmove_to(inserter_pos)\nfurnace_inserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=inserter_pos,\n    direction=Direction.UP\n)\nassert furnace_inserter, \"Failed to place furnace inserter\"\n\n# Fuel the new inserter if we have coal\nif Prototype.Coal in inspect_inventory():\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace_inserter, quantity=1)\n\nprint(f\"Basic automation setup completed. Current entities: {get_entities()}\")\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Wait a bit to see if the system is working\nsleep(5)\nprint(\"Checking if automation is working...\")\nprint(f\"Furnace contents: {inspect_inventory(furnace1)}\")\n```\n\nThis simplified version:\n1. Removes the crafting step since we can't craft iron gear wheels directly\n2. Uses fewer belts to make a minimal working connection\n3. Checks inventory before trying to use coal\n4. Makes shorter movements to stay in range\n5. Uses just three belt pieces to make the connection\n\nIf this works, we can then:\n1. Wait for iron plates to be produced\n2. Use those to craft transport belts\n3. Expand and optimize the belt layout\n\nLet me know if this runs better, and we can then work on improving the setup based on what resources we have available.", "summary_range": "[1-38]"}
