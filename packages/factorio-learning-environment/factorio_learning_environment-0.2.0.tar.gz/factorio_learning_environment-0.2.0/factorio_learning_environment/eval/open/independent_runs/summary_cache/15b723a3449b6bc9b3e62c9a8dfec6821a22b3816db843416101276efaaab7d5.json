This will prevent the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'` from occurring.\n- Double-check the connectivity of transport belts to ensure they are properly linked and functional.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing entities."}
