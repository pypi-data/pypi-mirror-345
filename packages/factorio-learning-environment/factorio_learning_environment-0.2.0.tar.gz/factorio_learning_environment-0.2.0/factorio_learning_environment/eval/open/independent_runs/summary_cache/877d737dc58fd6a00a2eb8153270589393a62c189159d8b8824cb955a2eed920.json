{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power System Components (Incomplete/In Progress)\n- Offshore pump at position(-7.5, 25.5) facing up\n- Boiler attempts at various positions, currently no stable placement\nThe power system is currently non-functional as components are being repositioned and rebuilt\n\n### Manufacturing Area\n- 4 Stone Furnaces in a row at y=0:\n  - Furnace at (0,0) with 17 coal\n  - Furnace at (2,0) with 18 coal  \n  - Furnace at (5,0) with no fuel\n  - Furnace at (8,0) with 8 coal\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\n- Input chest at (8.5, 1.5) containing iron plates, copper plates and iron gear wheels\n- Inserter at (9.5, 1.5) to feed assembling machine\n- Assembling machine at (11.5, 1.5) making automation science packs\n- Output inserter at (13.5, 1.5)\n- Output chest at (14.5, 1.5) containing 1 automation science pack\n\n### Additional Production Area\n- Two furnaces with coal:\n  - Furnace at (4.0, 4.0) with 19 coal\n  - Furnace at (6.0, 4.0) with 21 coal\n- Inserter at (4.5, 2.5) connecting to chest at (4.5, 1.5)\n\n### Research Labs\n- 10 labs connected to electricity network 41430\n- Some labs contain automation science packs:\n  - Lab 1: 56 packs\n  - Lab 3: 110 packs\n  - Lab 4: 31 packs\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups:\n- Belt group from (4.5, 2.5) to (2.5, 2.5)\n- Belt group from (6.5, 2.5) to (4.5, 2.5)\n- Long belt group from (7.5, 3.5) to (-4.5, 19.5)\n- Belt group from (1.5, 5.5) to (1.5, 11.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Cannot place entities that overlap with water tiles\n- Ensure target position is within reach (max distance is 10 tiles from player position)\n- Verify the area is clear and suitable before placing structures\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Entities requiring power need to be properly connected to a power network\n- Steam engines need correct positioning relative to boilers\n- Boilers need proper fuel and water connections\n\n### Resource Access Errors\n- Cannot insert resources into entities that are too far away\n- Cannot extract from entities that are empty or too distant\n- Verify resource availability before attempting insertion/extraction\n\n### Connection Issues\n- Ensure proper fluid connections between offshore pump, boiler and steam engine\n- Power producing entities need correct orientation and connections to work\n- Verify entity status through fluid box and connection point information\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting placement/insertion\n- Coal/fuel needs to be in inventory before attempting to fuel entities\n- Track inventory changes after mining operations"}
