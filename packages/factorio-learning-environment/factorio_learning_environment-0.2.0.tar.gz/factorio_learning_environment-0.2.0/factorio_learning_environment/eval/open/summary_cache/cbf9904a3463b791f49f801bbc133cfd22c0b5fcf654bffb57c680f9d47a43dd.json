{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with frequent full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) serving as storage for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, feeding chests.\n- Small electric poles at (15.5, 75.5) and newly placed at (17.5, 72.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt remains unresolved, limiting mining drill throughput.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, working.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) connected by pipes, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles placed near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (0.5, 6.5).\n- Coal inserted into boiler and maintained for continuous operation.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power via small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) intended to feed iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Newly placed small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5) improving power coverage.\n- Assembling machine still unable to craft due to missing iron plates in input inventory despite iron plates being present in input chest.\n- Attempts to place additional burner inserters to feed assembling machine failed due to occupied tiles near (25.5, 81.5) and (26.5, 81.5).\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and output inserter, but requires proper inserter placement and input feeding to operate.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter placement failures due to occupied tiles\n- Multiple failed attempts to place burner inserters near assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) due to existing entities blocking placement at (25.5, 81.5) and (26.5, 81.5).\n- To mitigate, scan for free adjacent tiles before placement, consider repositioning or rotating existing entities, or use underground belts/inserters to optimize space.\n- Verify tile occupancy explicitly before attempting placement to avoid repeated exceptions.\n\n### Persistent output blockage in mining and smelting area\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked by full furnace output belt, limiting throughput.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing smelting progress.\n- Clear or extend output belts and chests to accept iron plates, or add additional storage to prevent blockage.\n- Regularly monitor belt and chest inventories to maintain flow.\n\n### Assembling machine input feeding issues\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) reports missing iron plates despite iron plates present in input chest at (21.5, 75.5).\n- Input inventory of assembling machine remains empty, indicating inserters are not feeding materials correctly.\n- Ensure inserters are correctly placed and oriented to transfer iron plates from input chest to assembling machine.\n- After failed inserter placements, consider alternative inserter positions or use different inserter types.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels"}
