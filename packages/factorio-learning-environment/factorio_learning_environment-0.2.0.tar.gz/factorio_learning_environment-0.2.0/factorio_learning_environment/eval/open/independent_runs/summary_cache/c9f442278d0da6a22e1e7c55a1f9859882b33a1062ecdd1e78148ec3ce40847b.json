Check all connection points and ensure that pipes are correctly placed and connected.\n  \n- **Boiler Fuel Issues**\n  - Make sure to supply fuel to the boiler to ensure it operates correctly. Without fuel, the boiler cannot produce steam.\n\n- **Fluid System Management**\n  - Regularly check fluid levels and ensure that all pipes are connected correctly to maintain fluid flow throughout the system.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - No specific variables have been assigned in the provided steps."}
