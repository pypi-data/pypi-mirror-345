{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Inserter at (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (9997 units)\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (22 units)\n  - Status: Normal\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Fuel: None\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Mining Drill at (-15.0, -50.0), Stone Furnace at (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Warnings: Out of fuel\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (19 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Ensure Adequate Fuel Supply\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt production processes.\n\n### Manage Inventory Space\n- Regularly extract items from chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can stop production processes like mining.\n\n### Ensure Ingredient Supply for Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Lack of ingredients will result in no production output.\n\n### Correct Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items, halting production.\n\n### Avoid Stale Entity Data\n- Regularly update and verify the status of entities to avoid working with outdated or incorrect data, which can lead to inefficiencies or errors in production."}
