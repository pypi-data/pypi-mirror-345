{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electric Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole at position (1.5, 1.833)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (2.5, 2.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (9.5, 6.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (9.5, 7.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (8.5, 9.5)\n\n### Laboratory\nLocated at position (6.5, 6.5), the lab is connected to multiple electric poles but is currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to Electric Poles\n- **Not Plugged into Electric Network**: Ensure that all electric poles are properly connected to the electric network. Check the positioning and connections of poles to avoid disconnections.\n- **Lab Not Powered**: Verify that the lab is connected to a powered electric pole. If the lab is still not powered, check the entire network for any disconnections or unpowered poles.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Could Not Place Small Electric Pole**: Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an electric pole. Check your inventory to confirm the presence of the small electric pole.\n- **Obstructing Entities**: If you encounter an obstructing entity, remove or relocate it before placing new structures. \n\n### General Inventory Management\n- **Missing Ingredients for Research**: To complete automation research, ensure you have the necessary ingredients (e.g., automation science packs) in your inventory. Regularly check your inventory to maintain required resources."}
