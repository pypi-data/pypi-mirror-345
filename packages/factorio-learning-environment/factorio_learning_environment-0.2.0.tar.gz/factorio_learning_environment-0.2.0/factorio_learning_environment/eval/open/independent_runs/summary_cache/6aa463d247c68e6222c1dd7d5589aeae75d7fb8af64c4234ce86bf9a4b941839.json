Verify that the search parameters and spatial configuration align with the actual positions of the pipe groups.\n\n\u2022 Aborted Connection Attempts Due to Missing Candidates:\n   - Connection operations are being aborted when no candidate pipe group with the specified fluid_system is found. Confirm that the fluid_system assignments in connection commands match the updated pipeline network configuration."}
