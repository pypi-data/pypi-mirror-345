{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position not specified)\n- Boiler (position not specified)\n- Steam engine (position not specified)\n- Electric pole at position (x=-13.5, y=24.5) intended to connect the steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel and iron plate production\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=5.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserters at positions (x=17.5, y=0.5) and (x=16.5, y=0.5), both not receiving electricity\n- Wooden chest at position (x=18.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-1.5, y=17.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=0.5, y=16.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=20.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-4.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=1.5, y=25.5), (x=7.5, y=10.5), and (x=15.5, y=2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors in Electricity Generation\n- Ensure the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and has input liquid. Verify that all pipes are correctly connected from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Verify the position before attempting to place entities like steam engines. Ensure there is no obstruction and the correct entity type is being placed at the intended position.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check that electric poles are correctly placed and connected to provide electricity to inserters.\n\n### Fluid Connection Errors\n- Make sure all fluid connections are properly established between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to avoid warnings about no fluid being present."}
