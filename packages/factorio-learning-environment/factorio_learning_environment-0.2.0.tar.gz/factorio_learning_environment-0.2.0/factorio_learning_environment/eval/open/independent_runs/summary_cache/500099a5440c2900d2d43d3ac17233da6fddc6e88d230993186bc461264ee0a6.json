{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The logs indicate that attempts to place entities such as Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts have been unsuccessful, resulting in no entities or structures being established on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing any entity is buildable. Verify the terrain and any existing obstructions before attempting to place structures like Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, or Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check that the tile is not already occupied by another entity or is otherwise unsuitable for building. This will prevent errors related to placing entities on non-buildable tiles.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operation\n- Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of necessary resources, such as coal for furnaces, before attempting to operate or place entities that require them.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Review the global build restrictions and environmental settings to ensure compliance with any constraints that might affect entity placement.\n\nThese tips should help in avoiding common errors and improving the efficiency of building and managing structures in the game."}
