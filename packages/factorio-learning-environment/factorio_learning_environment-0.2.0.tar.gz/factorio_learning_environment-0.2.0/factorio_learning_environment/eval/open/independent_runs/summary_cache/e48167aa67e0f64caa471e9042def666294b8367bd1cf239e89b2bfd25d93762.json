This setup is integrated into a transport\u2011belt network that distributes the mined ore.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\nCentered on a boiler at (8.0, 20.5) (currently out of fuel) with connection points at (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5). A series of steam engines are placed at:\n\u2022 (0.5, 9.5)  \n\u2022 (18.5, 11.5)  \n\u2022 (1.5, 13.5)  \n\u2022 (13.5, 14.5)  \n\u2022 (19.5, 14.5)  \n\u2022 (22.5, 18.5)  \n\u2022 (17.5, 20.5)  \n\u2022 (12.5, 21.5)  \n\u2022 (4.5, 23.5)  \nAdditionally, an extra steam engine remains unplaced due to severe congestion in the boiler area and obstruction in the buildable zone near (8.5, 22.5).\n\n### Automation Research Lab\nFeatures a lab configured for automation science pack research; however, it continues to experience unstable power connectivity.\n\n### Electrical and Transport Infrastructure\nComprises an integrated network of electrical poles organized into electricity groups, multiple belt groups for managing transport belts, and pipe groups that bundle fluid pipes\u2014ensuring coordinated flow of power, materials, and fluids.\n\n### Offshore Pump and Fluid Network\nConsists of an offshore pump at (0.5, 30.5) that feeds water into the fluid system through a connected network of pipes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Persistent Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  \u2013 The extra steam engine remains unplaceable because the area around the boiler at (8.0, 20.5) is severely congested and the vicinity of (8.5, 22.5) is obstructed.  \n  \u2013 Tip: Perform a comprehensive manual inspection of the boiler zone and its connections. Remove or reposition interfering burner\u2011inserters, transport belts, and any overlapping entities. Alternatively, relocate the extra steam engine to a less congested area or alter the boiler layout to create sufficient clearance.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Supply and Source Item Shortages  \n  \u2013 Multiple burner\u2011inserters and the burner\u2011mining drill are frequently flagged as \u201cout of fuel\u201d or \u201cwaiting for source items.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Tip: Ensure that fuel sources are positioned adjacent to burner\u2011powered entities and that fuel inventories are maintained to continuously supply these machines.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connectivity and Fluid Input Issues  \n  \u2013 Numerous steam engines report statuses such as \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d and \u201cno input liquid,\u201d indicating problems with electrical wiring and fluid piping.  \n  \u2013 Tip: Review and reconfigure electrical and fluid connections to guarantee that every steam engine is properly linked to the power network and receives the necessary liquid input.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Instability  \n  \u2013 The automation lab continues to suffer from unstable power connectivity.  \n  \u2013 Tip: Reevaluate the placement and wiring of nearby electrical poles to improve and stabilize the lab\u2019s power supply.\n\n\u2022 Overall Layout Congestion  \n  \u2013 The boiler region exhibits a clutter of overlapping and misaligned burner\u2011inserters and transport belts, which restricts the placement of additional entities.  \n  \u2013 Tip: Reorganize the spatial layout around critical connection points to eliminate overlaps and free up buildable zones, thereby facilitating proper placement and interconnection of structures.\n\n"}
