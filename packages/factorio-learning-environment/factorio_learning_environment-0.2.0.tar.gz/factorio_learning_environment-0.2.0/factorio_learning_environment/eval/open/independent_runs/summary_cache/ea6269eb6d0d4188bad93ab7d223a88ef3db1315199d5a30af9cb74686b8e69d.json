{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity group at position (52.5, 49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup (id=257366, poles at positions (52.5, 54.5), (53.5, 54.5), (55.5, 55.5), (51.5, 49.5), (52.5, 49.5), (53.5, 49.5))\n\n### Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- OffshorePump (position (-9.5, 24.5), status: WORKING)\n- Pipe (position (-9.5, 22.5))\n- Pipe (position (-9.5, 23.5))\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (name='stone-furnace', position (1.0, 1.0), status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Chest (name='wooden-chest', position (3.5, 1.5), inventory: {'iron-plate': 20})\n- Furnace (name='stone-furnace', position (10.0, 1.0), status: NO_FUEL)\n- BurnerInserter (position (8.5, 1.5), status: NO_FUEL)\n- Chest (name='wooden-chest', position (3.5, 3.5), inventory: {'iron-plate': 50})\n- Chest (name='wooden-chest', position (3.5, 5.5))\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing the small-electric-pole is clear of any entities or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water) before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the specified position contains the entity type you are trying to retrieve (e.g., steam-engine). If the entity is not found, check if it has been placed correctly or if it exists at that location.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The same issues with placing electric poles and retrieving entities have been encountered multiple times. It is crucial to check the environment and the positions of entities before executing these actions to avoid repeated failures."}
