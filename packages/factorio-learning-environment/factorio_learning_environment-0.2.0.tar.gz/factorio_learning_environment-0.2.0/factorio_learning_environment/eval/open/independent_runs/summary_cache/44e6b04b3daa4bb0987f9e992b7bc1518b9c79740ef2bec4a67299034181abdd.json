{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-11.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-9.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions when placing entities. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Regularly check and maintain the supply of source items to avoid waiting states.\n\n### Not Enough Iron Ore in Inventory\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of iron ore to supply furnaces consistently. Regularly check and replenish the iron ore stock to avoid production halts."}
