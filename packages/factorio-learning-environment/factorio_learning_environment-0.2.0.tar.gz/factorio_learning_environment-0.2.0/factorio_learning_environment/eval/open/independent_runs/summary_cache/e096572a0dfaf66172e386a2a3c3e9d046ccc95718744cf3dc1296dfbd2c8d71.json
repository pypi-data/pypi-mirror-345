{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=42.5, y=-83.5), (x=43.5, y=-83.5), and (x=44.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5), waiting for source items to transfer coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0), currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0), also has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=61.5, y=-52.5), (x=62.5, y=-53.5), and (x=62.5, y=-52.5) for storage of various items including coal and stone.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Belts from Wooden Chests\n- Ensure that you use an inserter to take items from a Wooden Chest before connecting belts. Direct connection from a Wooden Chest to a belt is not possible.\n\n### Errors in Placing Inserters\n- Check the surrounding area before placing an inserter to ensure there is enough space. If an inserter already exists at the target position, consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position.\n\n### Errors in Placing Transport Belts\n- Ensure you are within the maximum allowable distance (10 units) from the target position when placing a transport belt. Move closer to the target position if needed.\n- Verify that you have transport belts in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: Used to connect entities like belts, but failed when trying to connect directly from a Wooden Chest. Ensure proper usage by involving an inserter for item transfer.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `belt_start_position`: Position variable used for placing or connecting belts.\n- `nearest_belt_position`: Position variable used to determine the nearest belt connection point.\n\nThis report summarizes the current state of structures and provides guidance on addressing common errors encountered in the recent steps."}
