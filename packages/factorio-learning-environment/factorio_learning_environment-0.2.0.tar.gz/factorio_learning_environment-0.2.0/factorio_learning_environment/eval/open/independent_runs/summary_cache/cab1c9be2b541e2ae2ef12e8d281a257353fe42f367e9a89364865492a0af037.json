{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0) to (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly check and restock your coal supply to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Production\n- Verify that the furnace is properly fueled and supplied with iron ore to ensure continuous production of iron plates. Check the furnace's inventory and refuel as necessary.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring items between entities. Misalignment can lead to production inefficiencies or stoppages.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly clear out the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent it from becoming full, which halts mining operations. Consider expanding storage capacity or increasing the frequency of manual extraction.\n\n### General Inventory Management\n- Maintain a balanced inventory by regularly extracting and utilizing resources. This prevents bottlenecks and ensures smooth operation of all structures."}
