{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) processing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items to the stone furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) processing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring items to the stone furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure you have coal before trying to refuel machines.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities in Occupied or Invalid Positions\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place an entity. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage."}
