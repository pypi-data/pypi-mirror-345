{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Station at (24.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) for coal storage\n\n###Copper Processing Line at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Initial wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n- Middle wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5) storing copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0) for smelting\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) storing copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving ore between initial and middle chest\n- Burner inserter at (23.5, 21.5) moving ore from middle chest to furnace\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving plates from furnace to output chest\n\n###Iron Processing Line at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) storing iron ore\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0) for smelting\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Furnace Operation Issues\n- Furnaces showing \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status - Ensure proper inserter connections are set up to feed ore into furnaces\n- Furnace showing \"furnace fuel source is full\" warning - This is not an error but indicates optimal fuel levels\n\n###Inserter Setup Issues\n- Inserters showing \"waiting for source items\" status - This indicates the input source (chest/drill) is empty or the inserter is not properly oriented to pick up items\n- When placing inserters, ensure:\n  1. Proper orientation relative to source and destination\n  2. Pickup and drop positions align with source and destination entities\n  3. Sufficient fuel is provided\n\n###Resource Flow Optimization\n- Empty chests in production line indicate potential breaks in the material flow - verify inserter orientations and connections between components"}
