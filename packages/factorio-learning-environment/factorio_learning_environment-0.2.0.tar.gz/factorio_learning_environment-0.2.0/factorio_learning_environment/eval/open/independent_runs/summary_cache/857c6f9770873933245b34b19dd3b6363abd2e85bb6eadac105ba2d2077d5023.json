{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Currently working, fueled by coal, smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5): Transfers iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest. Currently waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5): Stores iron plates, currently holding 19 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5): Extracts items from the wooden chest and places them onto the transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt**: Connects the burner inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) to the burner inserter at position (6.5, 0.5). Consists of two belts.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5): Transfers items from the transport belt to the end wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5): Collects iron plates from the transport belt, currently holding 17 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect belts. Belts cannot be directly connected to a chest.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required raw materials\n- Gather the necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is a raw resource that must be gathered before crafting a wooden chest."}
