{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully placed on the map during these steps. Multiple recovery attempts were made to craft and position a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to support research, but the Lab was never produced due to missing inventory and resource shortages.\n\u2022 The agent did interact with pre\u2010existing furnace structures (e.g., one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used for iron plate smelting and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production); however, these were not constructed as new elements.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Invocation and Return Value Handling\n  \u2013 Use the correct parameter signature when calling get_entities. Do not include unsupported keywords (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or pass extra positional arguments. Verify the function signature to ensure compatibility.\n  \u2013 Always check that function calls return valid iterables (rather than None) before attempting to iterate over them to avoid TypeErrors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Chain Issues\n  \u2013 Confirm that the required Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting placement. Attempting to place an entity that is not in inventory results in placement errors.\n  \u2013 Ensure that all necessary sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available and producible. Verify that the complete crafting chain is operational, so that crafting complex items like a Lab does not fail due to missing dependencies.\n  \u2013 Perform inventory and resource checks ahead of crafting attempts so that shortages (such as insufficient iron-plates, copper-plates, or other intermediates) are identified and remedied before reattempting production.\n\n"}
