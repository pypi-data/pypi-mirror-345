Ensure the correct and consistent fluid_system is selected and that the boiler, offshore pump, and pipeline network are properly aligned before initiating a connection.\n\n\u2022 Redundant Pipeline Stabilization Waits:\n  - The use of repeated 10-second wait periods following each failed connection attempt introduces unnecessary delays. Optimize by verifying connection viability prior to imposing static wait times.\n\n\u2022 Persistent Water Supply Failure:\n  - Despite multiple connection attempts, the steam engine remains NOT_CONNECTED with persistent warnings related to fluid absence. Reassess and adjust the integration between water extraction, steam generation, and pipeline routing to secure reliable fluid delivery."}
