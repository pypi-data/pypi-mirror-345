{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with coal fuel and full output status.\n- Steam engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) with warnings about not being connected to the power network and no input liquid.\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5) working status, connected to pipes at positions (-10.5, 24.5) and (-9.5, 24.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt, producing copper plates.\n- Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt, producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at position (6.5, -59.5) with iron plates in inventory.\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups with varying statuses, including empty, working, and full output, connecting various parts of the infrastructure.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity groups with poles across different positions, currently with zero voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Electricity Connection\n- Ensure that all electric poles are correctly connected to form a continuous power network. Check for any nil values or incorrect indexing that may prevent connections.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to both the boiler and the power network. Ensure that there is sufficient input liquid and that all connections are clear of blockages.\n\n### Pipe Connection Failures\n- Before attempting to connect pipes, ensure that there are no placement blockages and that the pipes are correctly aligned to form a continuous path.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Check that the inserter is connected to a powered electricity network. Ensure that the poles are properly linked and that the network is active."}
