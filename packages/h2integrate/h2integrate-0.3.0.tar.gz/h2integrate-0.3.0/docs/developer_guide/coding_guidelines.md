# Coding guidelines

This document outlines the coding guidelines for H2Integrate development.

## Documentation development

The key to making H2Integrate more user-friendly is to have clear and concise documentation.
This includes docstrings for functions and classes, as well as high-level documentation for the tool itself.
We should also have a clear way to document the expected methods and attributes of classes so that users can develop their own models.

## Misc. development guidelines

- use Google style for docstrings
- use numpy instead of lists for arrays
- use type hints for function arguments and return values
