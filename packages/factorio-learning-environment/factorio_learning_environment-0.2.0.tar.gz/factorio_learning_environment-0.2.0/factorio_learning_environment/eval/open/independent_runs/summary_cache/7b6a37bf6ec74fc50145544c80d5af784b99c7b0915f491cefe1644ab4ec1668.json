Consider adjusting the spacing or changing the direction to avoid conflicts with existing structures.\n- Ensure you have sufficient items in your inventory before attempting to place a chest.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Make sure to gather enough resources, such as wood, before attempting to craft additional items like chests.\n\n### Inserter errors due to lack of source items\n- Ensure that there are sufficient source items available for inserters to function properly. Consider adding more resources to the source chests.\n\n### Inserter errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that the destination for inserter outputs is not blocked. Make sure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from inserters."}
