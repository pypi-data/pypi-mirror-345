{"content": "I notice that even though we added fuel to the drill, its status is still showing as NO_FUEL. Let's try to fix this:\n\n```python\n# Get all mining drills\ndrills = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})\nprint(f\"Found {len(drills)} mining drills\")\n\n# Focus on the drill at position (-20.0, 22.0)\ntarget_drill = None\nfor drill in drills:\n    if drill.position.x == -20.0 and drill.position.y == 22.0:\n        target_drill = drill\n        break\n\nprint(f\"Target drill status: {target_drill.status}\")\n\n# Move to the drill's position\nmove_to(target_drill.position)\nprint(\"Moved to drill position\")\n\n# Add more coal to the drill\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, target_drill, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added more coal to drill\")\n\n# Verify the drill's new status\nprint(f\"Updated drill status: {target_drill.status}\")\n\n# Check if there's iron ore nearby\niron_ore = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nif iron_ore:\n    print(f\"Found iron ore at: {iron_ore}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No iron ore found nearby\")\n\n# Check the wooden chest we placed\nchest = get_entities({Prototype.WoodenChest})[0]\nprint(f\"Chest inventory: {inspect_inventory(chest)}\")\n```\n\nThis should help us understand why the drill isn't working and what we need to do to get it operational. Would you like me to execute this code?", "summary_range": "[1-2768]"}
