{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) with a Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) with a Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -45.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions for transporting iron plates\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science pack, positioned for research activities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Power Setup\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are available in the inventory before attempting to connect them between entities like boilers, steam engines, and offshore pumps.\n- Check for possible collisions or obstructions when placing entities like boilers. Ensure there is enough space and that the area is suitable for placement, avoiding water or other blocking entities.\n- Verify that all components of the power setup are properly connected to avoid warnings such as \"not connected to power network\" or \"no fluid present in connections.\"\n- Ensure that all required items, such as pipes, are present in the inventory before attempting connections between power setup components.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Maintain a sufficient stock of necessary items like pipes in the inventory to prevent connection failures between critical infrastructure components.\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Avoid unsupported operations, such as incorrect operand types, to prevent execution errors in the setup process.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Consider increasing spacing or changing the direction when placing entities to avoid collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain like water."}
