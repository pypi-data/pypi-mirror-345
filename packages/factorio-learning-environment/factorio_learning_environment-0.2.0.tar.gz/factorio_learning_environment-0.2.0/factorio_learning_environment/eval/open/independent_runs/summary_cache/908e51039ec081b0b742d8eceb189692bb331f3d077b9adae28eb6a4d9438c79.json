{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5) producing water at ~370-380 units per 60 seconds\n- Boiler at position(-5.0, 2.5) with coal fuel (20-50 units remaining across observations)\n- Steam engine at position(0.5, 6.5) generating power at ~13500.0 energy\n- Small electric pole at position(0.5, 8.5) connected to the steam engine\n- Pipe connections between offshore pump and boiler, and between boiler and steam engine\nThe system is operational, with the boiler producing steam at 165\u00b0C, which powers the steam engine.\n\n### Crude Oil Production System at Position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5) extracting from a crude oil patch (~299,980 units remaining)\n- Small electric pole at position(15.5, 39.5) connecting the pumpjack to the power grid\n- Five storage tanks in sequence:\n  1. Storage tank at position(23.5, 43.5) containing ~8-30 units of crude oil\n  2. Storage tank at position(33.5, 47.5) containing ~1-19 units of crude oil\n  3. Storage tank at position(37.5, 57.5) containing ~0-5 units of crude oil\n  4. Storage tank at position(47.5, 61.5) containing ~0-1 units of crude oil\n  5. Storage tank at position(51.5, 71.5) containing ~0-0.08 units of crude oil\n- Extensive pipe network connecting the pumpjack to all storage tanks\nThe system is operational and producing approximately 838-858 units of crude oil per 60 seconds, well above the target of 250 units.\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nAn electricity network (ID: 6929) connecting the steam engine to the pumpjack, with multiple small electric poles spanning from position(0.5, 8.5) to position(15.5, 39.5). The network has a voltage of approximately 187,500.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent attributes\n- When accessing fluid information in storage tanks, use `fluid_box` instead of `fluid` to access fluid information.\n\n### Calculation errors\n- When calculating total crude oil in storage, ensure to correctly sum the amounts from all storage tanks' fluid boxes. The agent has been inconsistently reporting \"Total crude oil in storage: 0\" despite the tanks containing crude oil."}
