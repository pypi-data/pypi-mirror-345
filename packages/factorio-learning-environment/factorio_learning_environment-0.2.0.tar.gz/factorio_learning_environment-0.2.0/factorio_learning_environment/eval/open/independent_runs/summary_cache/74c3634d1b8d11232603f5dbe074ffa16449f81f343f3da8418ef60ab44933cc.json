{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Additional Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to:\n  - Small Electric Poles at positions (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5)\n  - Wooden Chests at positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5)\n  - Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Steam Engine Setup at position (8.5, 36.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (8.5, 36.5) not connected to the power network, lacking input liquid.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions:\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 10.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-5.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of multiple ElectricityGroups:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (2.5, -63.5), (1.5, -61.5), (4.5, -62.5), voltage: 0\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (11.5, 21.5), (16.5, 20.5), (3.5, -58.5), voltage: 0\n\n### Laboratory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of 12 automation science packs, currently without power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates cannot be crafted manually and require a furnace.\n\n### Errors in Power Supply\n- Verify that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a powered electricity network. Ensure that steam engines are connected to a water supply and the power network to function properly.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operation\n- Ensure that inserters have a power supply and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Check connections to the electricity network to resolve power issues."}
