{"content": "The execution resulted in an error when attempting to place the stone furnace at the position (-14.5, -14.5). The error message indicates that the target position is too far away from the player's current position (0, 0), exceeding the maximum allowable distance for placing entities, which is 10 units.\n\n### Summary of Actions and Errors:\n1. **Movement Attempts**: You successfully moved closer to the stone patch, but the final placement attempt was made from a distance that exceeded the allowed range.\n2. **Placement Error**: The attempt to place the stone furnace failed because the distance from the player\u2019s position to the target position was greater than the maximum allowed distance.\n\n### Tips to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Check Distance Before Placement**: Always ensure that the target position for placing an entity is within the maximum allowed distance from your current position. You can calculate the distance using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n   \\]\n   Ensure this distance is less than or equal to the maximum distance allowed (10 units in this case).\n\n2. **Incremental Movement**: When moving to a specific resource or position, consider moving in smaller increments to ensure you stay within the allowed distance for placing entities.\n\n3. **Use `nearest_buildable` Function**: If available, use the `nearest_buildable` function to find a valid position for placing entities that automatically considers distance constraints.\n\n4. **Verify Current Position**: Before attempting to place an entity, always check your current position relative to the target position to confirm you are close enough.\n\n5. **Plan Entity Placement**: When planning to place multiple entities, consider their arrangement and the distances involved to avoid exceeding placement limits.\n\nBy following these tips, you can minimize the chances of encountering similar placement errors in the future.", "summary_range": "[1-102]"}
