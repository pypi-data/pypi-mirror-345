{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 1 at position (x=8.5, y=13.5)\n- Iron gear input:\n  - Wooden chest at (x=7.5, y=10.5) containing iron gears\n  - Burner inserter at (x=8.5, y=10.5) feeding gears into assembler\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter at (x=10.5, y=13.5)\n  - Wooden chest at (x=11.5, y=13.5) for collecting science packs\n- Transport belt system connecting components (11 belts)\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining/smelting setups:\n1. First setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n- Wooden chest at (x=41.5, y=-80.5) containing coal\n- Burner inserter at (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\n2. Second setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\n- Wooden chest at (x=-27.5, y=-59.5)\n- Burner inserter at (x=-26.5, y=-59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (x=-25.0, y=-59.0)\n- Output inserter at (x=-23.5, y=-58.5)\n- Output chest at (x=-22.5, y=-58.5) containing iron plates\n\n3. Third setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (x=-18.0, y=-53.0)\n- Wooden chest at (x=-17.5, y=-51.5)\n- Burner inserter at (x=-16.5, y=-51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n- Output inserter at (x=-13.5, y=-50.5)\n- Output chest at (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Steam engine at (x=-4.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler at (x=-4.5, y=16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Connected by pipe networks (fluid systems 3806, 3814)\n- Electric pole network connecting power consumers\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Use appropriate spacing when placing entities next to each other\n- Consider different directions or reference positions if default placement fails\n- Pay attention to entity dimensions when placing larger machines\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner entities\n- Monitor resource input/output flows in production lines\n\n### Production Line Setup Errors\n- Verify correct positioning of inserters relative to machines they serve\n- Ensure proper connections between production line components\n- Check that all required inputs are accessible to inserters\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Keep boilers fueled for consistent power generation\n- Ensure proper fluid connections between offshore pump, boiler and steam engine\n- Maintain electrical connections through pole network to all consumers"}
