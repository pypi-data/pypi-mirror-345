{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0) with drop position at (x=-28.5, y=-62.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions for resource transport:\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-28.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-30.5, y=-64.5), direction LEFT\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=-28.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-30.5, y=-64.5), direction LEFT\n  - Additional belt connections facilitating transport from (x=-25.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-27.5, y=-64.5), and other positions\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=3.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=0.5, y=1.5) waiting for source items, picking up from (x=-0.5, y=1.5) and dropping at (x=1.5, y=1.5)\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-31.5, y=-61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-26.5, y=-60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-25.5, y=-61.5) to collect excess items\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups facilitating resource transport across various positions:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting positions such as (x=-26.5, y=-62.5) to (x=-28.5, y=-62.5), and others\n- BeltGroup with connections from (x=-25.5, y=-61.5) to (x=-23.5, y=-61.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Argument Type in insert_item Function\n- Ensure that the second argument in the `insert_item` function is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position.\n\n### Attribute Error with Tuple Objects\n- Avoid using tuple objects directly for operations that require attributes like 'x' or 'y'. Convert them to appropriate entity objects first.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied to prevent placement errors.\n\n### Connection Errors with NoneType Objects\n- Ensure that all entities involved in belt connections are properly initialized and not None to avoid attribute errors.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserter to function properly.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Place a sink object at the specified drop position to prevent the inserter from being blocked due to full destination space.\n\n### Errors Connecting Belts Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to connect belts.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For transport belts, ensure sufficient iron plates are available.\n\n### Fuel Insertion Errors\n- Confirm that the fuel type and quantity are available in the inventory before attempting to insert into a burner mining drill or similar entity."}
