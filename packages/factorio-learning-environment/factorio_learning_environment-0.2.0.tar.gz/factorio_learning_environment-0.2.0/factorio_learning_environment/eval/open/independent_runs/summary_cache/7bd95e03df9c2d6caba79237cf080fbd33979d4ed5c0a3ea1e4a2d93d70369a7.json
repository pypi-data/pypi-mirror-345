{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0) with fuel inventory of 20 coal, not connected to input liquid.\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5), not connected to power network, lacking input liquid.\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine, with multiple pipe entities at various positions.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with fuel inventory of 19 coal, output blocked.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with fuel inventory of 15 coal, no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with fuel inventory of 34 coal, no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with fuel inventory of 29 coal, no ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to move items between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) containing 10 iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing 460 iron ore and 255 iron plates.\n\n### Laboratory Setup\n- Lab with input of 2 automation science packs, lacking power connection.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple pipe groups are present, connecting various entities, but currently empty and not transporting any fluids.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available and can be crafted or smelted before attempting to craft complex items like small electric poles. Copper plates need to be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors in Item Insertion\n- Verify that the required items, such as coal, are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities like furnaces.\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a power network to function properly.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drills\n- Ensure there is a sink entity or storage available to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage and inefficiency."}
