{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transfer System\nLocated at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), this structure is designed to mine iron ore and transfer it to a furnace. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores the mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) which is supposed to smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Setup Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Repeated repositioning suggests misalignment.\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly set up to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. The furnace is not receiving iron ore, indicating a setup issue.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters and Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters and mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel. Inserters frequently run out of fuel, causing interruptions in item transfer.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory. An error occurred when trying to insert coal into an inserter without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace is currently not receiving iron ore, which is required for smelting into iron plates.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency of the production line can be significantly improved, ensuring a smoother operation."}
