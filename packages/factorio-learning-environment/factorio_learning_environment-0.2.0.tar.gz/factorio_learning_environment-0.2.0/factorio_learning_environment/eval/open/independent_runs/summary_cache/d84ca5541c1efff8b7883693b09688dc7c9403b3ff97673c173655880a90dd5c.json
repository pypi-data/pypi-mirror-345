{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fueled by coal, currently working, with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n  - Neighbors: Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5) and Burner Inserter at (-13.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Contains iron ore, currently 3 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Positioned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - Currently out of fuel, with neighbors including the Wooden Chest and Stone Furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fueled by coal, but not receiving iron ore to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Fuel Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and fueled to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the inserter setup to ensure it is functioning properly.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- The chest at the drop position of the mining drill is full. Regularly empty the chest to ensure continuous mining operations.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Ensure that the inserter is properly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check the alignment and fuel status of the inserter to prevent interruptions in smelting operations.\n\n### Mining Drill Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel the mining drill with coal to maintain continuous operation. Monitor coal inventory to prevent fuel shortages.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Manage the inventory effectively to ensure sufficient resources are available for refueling and maintaining operations."}
