{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position(x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position(x=-20.0, y=-70.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) supplied with iron ore and coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0) supplied with iron ore and coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) supplied with iron ore and coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position(x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position(x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a series of Transport Belts leading to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position(x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Transport and Processing System at Position(x=-20.5, y=-66.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) connected to a Transport Belt system leading to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0).\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transfer System at Position(x=1.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) connected to another Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) via a Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity contains items for the inserter to pick up. If the source is empty, the inserter will not function.\n\n### Errors with Chests Being Full\n- Regularly check and clear out chests that are full to prevent inserters from stalling due to lack of space to drop items.\n\n### Errors with Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
