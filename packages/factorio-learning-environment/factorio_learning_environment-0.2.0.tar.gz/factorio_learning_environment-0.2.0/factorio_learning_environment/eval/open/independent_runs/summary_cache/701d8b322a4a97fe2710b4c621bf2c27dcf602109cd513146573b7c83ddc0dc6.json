{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Containers\n- Ensure that the quantity to extract is greater than 0 before attempting to extract items from a container.\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source to the destination. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly configured to supply the furnace with the necessary ingredients for smelting.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as inserters and mining drills to ensure continuous operation."}
