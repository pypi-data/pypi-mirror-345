{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), (49.5, -80.5) for storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for moving items between entities.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional storage.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storage.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), (-10.5, -45.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) for additional storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), (-8.5, -49.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) for moving items between entities.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inserters Waiting for Items\n- Multiple inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) are waiting for items. Ensure that the upstream supply chain is not blocked and that resources are being fed into the system efficiently.\n\n#### Full Chests Blocking Mining Operations\n- The chests at drop positions (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) are full, preventing further mining. Regularly check and empty these chests to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n#### Blocked Furnace Belts\n- Burner inserters at positions (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), and (-8.5, -49.5) are waiting for space in the destination, indicating blocked furnace belts. Ensure that the output from furnaces is being cleared efficiently to prevent bottlenecks."}
