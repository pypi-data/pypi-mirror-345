# H.A.W.K - High-Accuracy Wordsmithing Kernel

A Chrome extension that enhances your prompts using a built-in, lightweight language model. H.A.W.K works completely offline and requires no API keys or external services.

## Easy Installation via pip

H.A.W.K now provides an effortless installation process using pip! Simply follow these steps:

```bash
# Install the package

# Run the installer
hawk-installer
```

That's it! The installer will:
1. Open a web page in your browser automatically
2. Guide you through installing the Chrome extension
3. Provide setup instructions

## Features

3. Your prompts never leave your computer
4. The extension works even without internet connection
