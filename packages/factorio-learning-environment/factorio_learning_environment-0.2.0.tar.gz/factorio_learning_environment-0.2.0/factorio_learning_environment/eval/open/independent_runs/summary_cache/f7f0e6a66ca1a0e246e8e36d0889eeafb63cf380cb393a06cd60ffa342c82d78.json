{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position (117.5, -30.5)), boiler(position (111.5, -32.0)), and offshore pump(position (106.5, -32.5)) connected by pipes.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(60.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace(position (60.0, -60.0)).\n\n### Pipe network at position(105.5, -32.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes connected to the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Electricity distribution network at position(111.5, -30.5)\nConsists of multiple small electric poles connected to the steam engine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when using `connect_entities` function: \n  - Ensure that the positions passed to the function are correct and do not have a `position` attribute.\n  - Make sure to pass integer values for positions, not floats.\n* Errors when placing entities: \n  - Ensure that the tile is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* `connect_entities`: a function that connects two entities with a pipe. \n  - Failure mode: raises an `AttributeError` if the positions passed have a `position` attribute, or a `TypeError` if the positions are floats.\n  - Success mode: returns the connected pipes.\n* Important variables:\n  - `offshore_pump_position`: a `Position` object representing the position of the offshore pump.\n  - `boiler_position`: a `Position` object representing the position of the boiler.\n  - `steam_engine_position`: a `Position` object representing the position of the steam engine.\n  - `Prototype.Pipe`: a prototype object representing a pipe."}
