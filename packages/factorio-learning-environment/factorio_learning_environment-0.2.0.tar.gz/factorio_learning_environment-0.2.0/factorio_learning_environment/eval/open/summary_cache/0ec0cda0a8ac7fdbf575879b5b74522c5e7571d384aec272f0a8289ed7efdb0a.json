{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt (belt placement failed but inserter placed).\n  \nThis structure forms a connected iron plate production line from ore extraction to plate output onto a belt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing entities due to occupied tiles\n- When placing inserters or belts next to existing entities, ensure the target tile is free. If placement fails due to an occupied tile (e.g., wooden chest or burner inserter), try increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n- Specifically, placing a burner inserter next to the furnace initially failed because the wooden chest occupied the intended tile. Adjusting placement resolved this.\n- Similarly, placing a transport belt next to the chest failed because a burner inserter was already there. Plan entity placement order and spacing to avoid overlaps.\n\n### Inserter fuel and operation issues\n- Inserters can run out of fuel causing them to stop working. Regularly insert fuel (coal) into burner inserters to keep them operational.\n- Inserters may wait for source items or destination space. Ensure upstream entities produce items and downstream entities or belts have capacity to receive items to avoid blocking.\n\n### Item insertion errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Attempting to insert items (e.g., coal) into entities can fail if the inventory lacks the required items. Track inventory carefully before insertion commands to avoid exceptions.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
