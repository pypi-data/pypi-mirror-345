{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (4.5, 1.5) for transferring items between the furnace and a chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5) for storing produced iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of items across the map.\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5), direction UP.\n  - Additional belts connecting positions (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Burner Inserter Fuel Management\n- Ensure that burner inserters are consistently refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest) available to accept the output from inserters to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Positioning\n- Verify that inserters are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items to and from the intended entities."}
