{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation (Unchanged)\n- **Electric mining drills** at positions (15.5, 70.5), (18.5, 70.5), and (21.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnaces** at positions (16.0, 73.0), (19.0, 73.0), and (22.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Output system** consisting of wooden chests at positions (16.5, 75.5), (19.5, 75.5), and (22.5, 75.5) with inserters at positions (16.5, 74.5), (19.5, 74.5), and (22.5, 74.5) to transfer smelted plates into chests.\n\n#### Power Generation Setup (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at position (-9.5, -0.5) facing RIGHT, connected to a **pipe** at (-8.5, -0.5).\n- **Boiler** at (-7.0, 0.5) with input connection at (-7.5, 0.5), but not receiving water (status: `NOT_CONNECTED`).\n- **Steam engine** at (-1.5, 5.5) not connected to the boiler.\n- **Small electric poles** placed but not forming a complete power network.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Fluid Connection Errors\n- **Boiler not receiving water**: The boiler at (-7.0, 0.5) is not correctly connected to the pipe at (-8.5, -0.5). Ensure the pipe is aligned with the boiler's input connection point (-7.5, 0.5).\n- **Misaligned boiler placement**: The boiler at (-7.0, 0.5) is not aligned with the pipe. Adjust the boiler's position or direction to ensure proper connection.\n- **Pipe placement conflicts**: Avoid placing pipes where existing entities block the connection. Clear the target area before placing pipes.\n\n#### Power Connection Issues\n- **Electric mining drills and inserters not receiving power**: Ensure all electric entities are within the coverage area of electric poles and that the power network is properly connected and operational.\n\n#### General Tips\n- **Check entity statuses**: Always verify the status of entities (e.g., `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED`, `EntityStatus.NO_POWER`) to diagnose issues.\n- **Debugging fluid systems**: Use debug tools to check pipe connections and fluid flow if issues persist. Ensure pipes are correctly placed and aligned.\n- **Fuel and ingredients**: Ensure boilers have fuel and furnaces have ingredients to operate.\n\n#### New Errors from Recent Steps\n- **Boiler placement conflicts**: Ensure no existing entities block boiler placement. Clear the target area before attempting to place.\n- **Pipe alignment issues**: Verify that pipes are correctly aligned with the boiler's input and output points. Misalignment can prevent fluid transfer.\n- **EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT**: The pipe at (-8.5, -0.5) is not transferring water to the boiler. Check the connection and ensure the boiler is correctly placed and aligned.\n\n#### Repeated Errors\n- **Pipe placement failures**: Multiple attempts to place pipes at (-7.5, -2.5) and (-7.5, -1.5) failed due to existing objects. Clear these positions before placing pipes.\n- **Underground pipe placement issues**: Ensure underground pipes are placed in pairs and aligned correctly to avoid placement conflicts."}
