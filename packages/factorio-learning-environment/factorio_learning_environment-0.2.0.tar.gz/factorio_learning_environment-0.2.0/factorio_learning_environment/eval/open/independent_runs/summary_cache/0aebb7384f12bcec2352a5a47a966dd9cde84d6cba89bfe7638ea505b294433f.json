{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Storage and Transfer System at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with an empty inventory.\n- Wooden chest (position 43.5, -80.5) containing 39 coal.\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) transferring items between the two chests, currently waiting for source items.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 52.0, -79.0) with 26 coal as fuel, currently idle due to no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner inserter (position 53.5, -79.5) waiting to transfer items to the furnace.\n- Wooden chest (position 54.5, -79.5) containing 336 iron plates.\n- Burner inserter (position 55.5, -78.5) waiting to transfer items from the chest.\n- Wooden chest (position 56.5, -78.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) out of fuel and unable to mine due to a full chest.\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with an empty inventory.\n- Burner inserter (position -13.5, -48.5) waiting to transfer items from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Burner inserter (position -12.5, -48.5) waiting to transfer items.\n\n#### Central Storage at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 0.5, 0.5) containing various items including coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n- Wooden chest (position 1.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and other items.\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing 162 coal.\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) containing 325 coal.\n- Wooden chest (position 4.5, 0.5) containing coal and iron ore.\n- Wooden chest (position 5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that all burner entities (e.g., mining drills, inserters, furnaces) have sufficient fuel to operate. Refuel them as needed.\n\n#### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to allow mining and production to continue. For example, the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full, preventing the mining drill from operating.\n\n#### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and other production entities have the necessary ingredients to function. For example, the stone furnace at (52.0, -79.0) is idle due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n#### Errors due to waiting for source items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to the items they need to transfer. For example, the burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) is waiting for source items to transfer between chests.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- None assigned yet."}
