{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with 2 coal as fuel and 25 iron ore as input. The output is currently full with 100 iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) with 1 coal as fuel, currently working and extracting iron ore from the nearby wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5). It has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) containing 385 iron ore.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) containing 661 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient fuel\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel the Burner Mining Drill. Check your inventory regularly to avoid running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors when the chest is full\n- If you receive a warning that the chest at the drop position is full, empty the chest to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue mining. Regularly check the inventory of your chests to manage storage effectively.\n\n### Errors when inserting into a full furnace\n- If the furnace output is full, it cannot process any more items. Ensure that you have a plan to manage the output, such as moving the produced items to another storage location.\n\n### Errors when extracting from a chest\n- Make sure to extract items from the chest only when it has sufficient items available. If the chest is empty or has insufficient items, adjust your extraction strategy accordingly.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions Defined\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables Assigned\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron_ore`: int\n- `iron_plate`: int"}
