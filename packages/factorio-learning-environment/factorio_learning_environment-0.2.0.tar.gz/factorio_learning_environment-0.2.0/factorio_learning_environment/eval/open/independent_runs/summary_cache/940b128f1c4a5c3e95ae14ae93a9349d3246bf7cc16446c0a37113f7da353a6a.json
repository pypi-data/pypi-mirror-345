{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5): Stores iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5): Stores iron plates produced by the furnace.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- **Burner Mining Drill at (x=2.0, y=-63.0) ran out of fuel**: Ensure the mining drill is consistently fueled with coal to avoid interruptions in iron ore extraction.\n- **Furnace at (x=6.0, y=-63.0) has no ingredients to smelt**: Ensure furnaces are supplied with both fuel and raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to maintain production.\n\n#### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- **Extracting from empty chests**: Avoid extracting items from chests that are empty. Check the chest's inventory before attempting extraction.\n- **Inserter waiting for source items**: Ensure the inserter has access to items to transfer. This often happens when the source chest is empty or the inserter is misaligned.\n\n#### General Tips\n- **Monitor fuel levels**: Regularly check and replenish fuel in burner-based entities (mining drills, furnaces, and inserters) to prevent downtime.\n- **Optimize resource flow**: Ensure all components of a production chain (e.g., mining drill \u2192 chest \u2192 inserter \u2192 furnace) are properly connected and functioning."}
