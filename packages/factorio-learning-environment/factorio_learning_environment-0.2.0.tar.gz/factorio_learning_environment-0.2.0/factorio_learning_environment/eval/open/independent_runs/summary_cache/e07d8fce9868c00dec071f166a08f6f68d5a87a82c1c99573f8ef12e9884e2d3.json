Multiple attempts were made to locate, craft, and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded due to resource shortages and placement failures. Although existing furnaces (e.g., one at (5.0, 5.0) and another at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were utilized for smelting operations, they were not newly built by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage \u2013 When calling functions such as get_entities, avoid using unsupported keywords (for example, \u201cradius\u201d) or supplying an incorrect number of positional arguments. Always verify the API\u2019s signature before use.\n\u2022 Iterable Validations \u2013 Before iterating over the results of an API call, confirm that the returned value is indeed an iterable. Use a fallback (such as an empty list) to prevent \u201cNoneType object is not iterable\u201d errors.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement \u2013 Prior to attempting Lab crafting or placement, ensure that all prerequisite ingredients (e.g., iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, copper-plate, copper-cable, electronic-circuit) are available. Verify that the supply chains (including necessary smelting operations) are active and double-check inventory for the intended Lab item before placement."}
