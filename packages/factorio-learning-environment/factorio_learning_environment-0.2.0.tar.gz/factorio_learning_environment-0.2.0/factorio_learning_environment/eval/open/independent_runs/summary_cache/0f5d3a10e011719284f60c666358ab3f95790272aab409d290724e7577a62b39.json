For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a power source. Check for warnings such as \"not receiving electricity\" and ensure that power poles are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Errors Due to Misplaced Entities\n- Verify that entities are placed in appropriate and non-occupied tiles to avoid placement errors."}
