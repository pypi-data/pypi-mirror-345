{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete/Not Working)\nLocated around position (-8.5, 24.5) to (-2.5, 14.5), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-8.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 14.5)\nCurrently not functioning due to connection issues\n\n### Manufacturing Area\nLocated around position (23.5, 2.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 for crafting inserters\n- Two burner inserters at (21.5, 2.5) and (25.5, 2.5)\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 2.5) containing 36 inserters\n- Output wooden chest at (26.5, 2.5)\n\n### Science Pack Production\nLocated at (32.5, 5.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 for crafting logistic science packs\n- Currently not operating due to missing resources\n\n### Smelting Area\nMultiple furnaces at:\n- (0.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 0.0) with 2 iron plates in output\n- (4.0, 4.0) with coal fuel\n- (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces currently inactive due to lack of ingredients\n\n### Research Labs\nMultiple labs spread across the map, all currently without power:\n- Several labs with various science pack inputs\n- Some labs containing logistic science packs and automation science packs\n- One lab containing 40 logistic science packs\n\n### Electrical Network\nNetwork ID 61088 connecting multiple electric poles, currently not providing power\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes near water\n- Keep minimum 1 tile distance from water tiles when placing pipes or underground pipes\n- Ensure offshore pump is correctly oriented relative to water source before building pipe network\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Remove existing entities before attempting to place new ones at the same position\n- Check target position is clear before placing pipes or other entities\n- Use remove_entity() command to clear occupied positions\n\n### Power system connection issues \n- Ensure complete pipe network between offshore pump, boiler and steam engine\n- Verify correct orientation and connections of all power system components\n- Build water pipes first, then steam pipes to complete the circuit\n- Use underground pipes to avoid overlapping with other entities\n\n### Entity placement near water\n- Place offshore pump directly adjacent to water\n- Build pipe network starting 1 tile away from water edge\n- Use proper pump orientation facing away from water source"}
