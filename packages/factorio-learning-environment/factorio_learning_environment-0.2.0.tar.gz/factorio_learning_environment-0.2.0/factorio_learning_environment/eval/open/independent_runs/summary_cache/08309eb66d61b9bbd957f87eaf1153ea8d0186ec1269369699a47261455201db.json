{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) fueled with coal, currently working and connected to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) currently empty.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items, connected to the chest at (52.5, -77.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -77.5) currently empty.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) fueled with coal, currently working, and dropping iron ore into a wooden chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) fueled with coal, currently lacking ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items, connected to the chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest at (-13.5, -45.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Multiple inserters at positions (52.5, -79.5), (52.5, -76.5), (-11.5, -48.5), (-8.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -46.5) are waiting for source items. Ensure that the source items are available and that there are no blockages in the supply chain.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- The burner mining drill at (-12.0, -51.0) indicates that the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) is full. Regularly empty the chest to prevent mining operations from halting.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- The stone furnace at (-14.0, -49.0) lacks ingredients to smelt. Ensure a steady supply of iron ore to maintain continuous production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Current inventory includes items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
