{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Receives iron ore from the inserter and stores iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5): Transfers items between the chests and the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Non-Existent or Incorrect Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from exists and contains the required items. Double-check the entity's position and inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities with Incorrect Spacing or Direction\n- When placing entities next to others, ensure that the spacing and direction are appropriate for the intended placement. Adjust the parameters to accommodate existing structures and avoid placement errors."}
