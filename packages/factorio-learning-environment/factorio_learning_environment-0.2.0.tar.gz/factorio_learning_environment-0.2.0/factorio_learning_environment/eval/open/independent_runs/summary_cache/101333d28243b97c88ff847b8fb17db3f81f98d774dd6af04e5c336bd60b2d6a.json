{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has not successfully placed any entities or constructed any structures. The logs indicate multiple attempts to place various entities, but none have been successful.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. The agent attempted to place entities like Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, Stone Furnaces, and Burner Inserters at various coordinates, but these attempts failed. Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, ensure that the location is valid and not obstructed by other objects or terrain features. This will help avoid placement errors and ensure successful construction of structures."}
