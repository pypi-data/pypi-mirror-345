{"content": "Based on the logs, here is the updated report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-82.0, 41.0)\n- Burner mining drill extracting coal\n- Connected to iron chest at (-83.5, 41.5) containing 797 coal\n- Additional iron chest at (-84.5, 41.5) containing 1600 coal\n\n### Iron Smelting System at (-81.0, 46.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-81.0, 45.0) and (-81.0, 47.0), both fueled with 50 coal each\n- Input wooden chest at (-77.5, 46.5) containing 48 iron ore\n- Two burner inserters at (-78.5, 46.5) and (-78.5, 47.5) for feeding furnaces\n- Two belt groups:\n  - Left group: Belts at (-79.5, 46.5) and (-79.5, 45.5)\n  - Right group: Belts at (-79.5, 47.5) and (-79.5, 48.5)\n- Output system:\n  - Two burner inserters at (-82.5, 45.5) and (-82.5, 47.5)\n  - Wooden chest at (-83.5, 46.5) for output collection\n  - Additional wooden chests at (-84.5, 45.5)\n\n### Storage Area\n- Wooden chest at (-79.5, 49.5) containing 50 coal and 1500 iron plates\n- Wooden chest at (-80.5, 49.5) containing 800 coal\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing new entities\n- Check for existing objects that might block placement\n- Example: Failed to place transport belt due to existing objects\n\n2. Resource Management\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting placement\n- Example: Failed to place splitter due to missing splitter in inventory\n\n3. Belt System Design\n- Plan belt layouts carefully to avoid conflicts with existing structures\n- Consider space requirements for belt turns and splits\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `input_chest`: Wooden chest (Position: -77.5, 46.5)\n- `left_furnace`: Stone furnace (Position: -81.0, 45.0)\n- `right_furnace`: Stone furnace (Position: -81.0, 47.0)\n- `left_inserter`: Burner inserter (Position: -78.5, 46.5)\n- `right_inserter`: Burner inserter (Position: -78.5, 47.5)\n\n### Entity States\n- Furnaces: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Input Inserters: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n- Storage Chests: NORMAL (some with \"chest is full\" warning)\n- Mining Drill: NO_FUEL"}
