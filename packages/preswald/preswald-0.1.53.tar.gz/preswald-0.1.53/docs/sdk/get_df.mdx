```python
get_df(source_name: str, table_name: Optional[str] = None) -> pd.DataFrame
```

The `get_df` function retrieves data from a configured source and returns it as a pandas DataFrame. For database sources (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse), a table name must be specified.

## Parameters

- `source_name` (str): Name of the data source as configured in preswald.toml OR a path to a file (supports CSV, Parquet, and JSON)
- `table_name` (Optional[str]): Required for database sources, specifies which table to retrieve

## Returns

- `pd.DataFrame`: Data from the specified source as a pandas DataFrame

## Usage Examples

Note: `connect` must be called before `get_df` can be used.

### CSV Source

For CSV sources, `table_name` is not required since the entire CSV file is treated as a single table:

```python
from preswald import get_df

# Read entire CSV file
customers_df = get_df('eq_csv')

# Or, read specific CSV file
customers_df = get_df('data/sample.csv')
```

### PostgreSQL Source

For PostgreSQL sources, `table_name` is required:

```python
from preswald import get_df

# Read specific table from PostgreSQL
earthquakes_df = get_df('eq_pg', 'earthquake_events')
```

### ClickHouse Source

Similarly for ClickHouse sources, `table_name` is required:

```python
from preswald import get_df

# Read specific table from ClickHouse
events_df = get_df('eq_clickhouse', 'events')
```

## Error Handling

The function includes comprehensive error handling:

1. Validates source existence
2. Checks for required table_name parameter for database sources
3. Handles connection and query errors
4. Provides detailed error messages through logging

## Best Practices

1. Always call `connect()` before using
2. Always check if source exists in preswald.toml before calling
3. For database sources, always provide `table_name`
4. Use error handling when calling the function
5. Consider memory limitations when retrieving large datasets

Example with error handling:

```python
from preswald import get_df

try:
    df = get_df('eq_pg', 'large_table')
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Configuration error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error retrieving data: {e}")
```
