{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5). This drill is responsible for mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) used for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for additional storage of iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-12.5, -49.5) and (-9.5, -49.5) for storing materials.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-14.5, -47.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5). This drill is responsible for mining coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) for processing coal.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for moving coal and iron plates between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Storage\n- Ensure that the target storage entity contains the desired item before attempting to extract. Verify the presence of items in the storage before extraction attempts.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Drop Chests\n- Make sure the drop chest is not full or obstructed before attempting to clear it. Regularly check and clear drop chests to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Iron Plates from Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace has completed smelting and contains iron plates before attempting extraction. Monitor furnace status and output inventory for availability.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Check the fuel status of entities before refueling to avoid redundant actions. Ensure that drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### General Placement and Extraction Errors\n- Confirm the presence and status of entities before interacting with them to prevent errors related to non-existent or inaccessible entities."}
