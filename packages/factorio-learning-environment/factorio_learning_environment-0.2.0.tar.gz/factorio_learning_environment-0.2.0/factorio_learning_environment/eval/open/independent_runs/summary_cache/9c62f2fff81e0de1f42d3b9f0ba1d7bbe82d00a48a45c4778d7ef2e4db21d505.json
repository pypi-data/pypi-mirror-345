{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -21.5, 28.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is currently not connected and has no input liquid, while the boiler is out of fuel and also not connected.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1\n\n### PIPE SYSTEM\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipe segments connecting various entities including the offshore pump and boiler. The pipe segment was placed from position (-20.5, 28.5) to offshore pump input position (-9.5, 23.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing a pipe where an entity already exists\n- Ensure to remove any existing entities at the target position before placing a new entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes due to placement blockage\n- Check for any entities blocking the connection path before attempting to connect pipes. Ensure that the positions are clear for a successful connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
