{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with coal as fuel, currently working.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0) with coal as fuel, but showing a warning for 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0) with coal as fuel, but showing a warning for 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Copper Mining Drill\n- Ensure there is sufficient space available before attempting to place a copper mining drill. Consider checking the surrounding area for obstructions.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Resources\n- Make sure there are resources available for extraction before attempting to extract from a mining drill.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces.\n\n### Errors when Finding Entity Positions\n- Double-check the specified positions when trying to retrieve entities. Ensure that the entity exists at the given coordinates.\n\n### Errors with Building Box Size\n- When using the `nearest_buildable` function, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. Consider using smaller BuildingBoxes if necessary.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `get_entity(Prototype, Position)`: Used to retrieve an entity at a specified position. Ensure the entity exists at the position to avoid exceptions.\n- `insert_item(Prototype, Entity, quantity)`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure the inventory has the required items to avoid insertion errors.\n- `nearest_buildable(Prototype, BuildingBox, Position)`: Used to find a buildable position. Ensure the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the map space.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_drill`: Represents a copper mining drill entity.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents a furnace for copper processing.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents a furnace for iron processing.\n- `new_copper_drill_position`: Represents the position for placing a new copper mining drill."}
