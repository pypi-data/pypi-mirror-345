{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe waiting period has concluded, and here are the updated statuses for our furnaces:\n\n### Updated Furnace Status:\n1. **First Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 8 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 0 (none remaining)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 63 (total)\n   - Status: NO INGREDIENTS (idle)\n\n2. **Second Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 11 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 5 (available for processing)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 37 (total)\n   - Status: WORKING (currently processing)\n\n### Summary:\n- The first furnace has successfully produced a total of 63 iron plates but is now idle due to a lack of iron ore.\n- The second furnace is still active, processing its remaining 5 iron ore and has produced a total of 37 iron plates.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. We should gather more iron ore to keep the first furnace operational.\n2. Monitor the second furnace as it continues to process its iron ore.\n\nLet\u2019s find the nearest iron ore patch and gather additional resources to ensure both furnaces can operate efficiently.\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1. Find the nearest iron ore position again\niron_ore_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\n\n# 2.
