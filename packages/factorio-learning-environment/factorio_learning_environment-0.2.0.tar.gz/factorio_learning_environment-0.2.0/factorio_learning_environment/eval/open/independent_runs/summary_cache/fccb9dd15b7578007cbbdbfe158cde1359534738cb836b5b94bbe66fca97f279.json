{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Transport Belt network connecting various positions to facilitate ore movement.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for iron plate storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) to manage item transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that all entities used in the code are properly defined and imported. For example, the error \"NameError: name 'BurnerInserter' is not defined\" indicates a missing definition or import. Verify that 'BurnerInserter' is correctly referenced from the appropriate module.\n\n### Errors with Stale Entity Data\n- Regularly update and verify entity data to prevent stale data errors. This includes ensuring that all entities are correctly initialized and updated in the game state.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Address warnings related to inserters waiting for source items by ensuring that the source entities have the necessary items available for transfer. Check the inventory of source entities and adjust the logistics accordingly.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Implement overflow management strategies, such as adding additional storage or optimizing item usage."}
