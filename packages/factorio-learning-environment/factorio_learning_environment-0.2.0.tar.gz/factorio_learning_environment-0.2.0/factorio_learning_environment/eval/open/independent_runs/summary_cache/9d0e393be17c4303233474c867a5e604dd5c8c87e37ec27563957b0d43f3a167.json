Stone is a raw resource that must be harvested, not crafted.\n\n### Could not harvest. Nothing within reach to harvest\n- Make sure there are harvestable resources within the specified radius of the target position when using the `harvest_resource` function.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions:\n- `craft_item(item_prototype, quantity)`:\n    - Failure: If the required raw resources for crafting the item are not available in the inventory.\n    - Success: Creates the specified quantity of the item and adds it to the inventory.\n- `harvest_resource(position, quantity, radius)`:\n    - Failure: If there are no harvestable resources within the specified radius of the target position.\n    - Success: Harvests the specified quantity of resources from the target position and adds them to the inventory.\n\n### Variables:\n- `stone_pos`: Type unknown, likely a Position object representing the location of a stone resource.\n```"}
