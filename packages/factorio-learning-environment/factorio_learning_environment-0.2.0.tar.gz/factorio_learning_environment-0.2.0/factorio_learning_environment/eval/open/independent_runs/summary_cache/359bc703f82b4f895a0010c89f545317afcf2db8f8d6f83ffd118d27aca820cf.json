{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the ground.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Entities\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Regularly check and refuel these entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Incorrect Crafting Attempts\n- Coal cannot be crafted as it is a raw resource. Make sure to gather coal from resource patches instead of attempting to craft it.\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Setup Issues\n- If a furnace is not receiving iron ore, check the inserter setup. Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer materials between entities.\n\n### Chest Capacity Management\n- Regularly extract items from chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Ensure chests have enough space to accommodate incoming resources.\n\n### Fuel Management for Burner Entities\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner entities like mining drills and inserters to avoid production stoppages due to lack of fuel."}
