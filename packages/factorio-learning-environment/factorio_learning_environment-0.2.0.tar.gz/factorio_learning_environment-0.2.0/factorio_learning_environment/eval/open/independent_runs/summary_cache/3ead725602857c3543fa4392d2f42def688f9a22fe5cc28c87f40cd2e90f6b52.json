{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the steam engine and boiler\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore\n- Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) fueled with coal and processing copper ore\n- Inserter at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5) waiting for source items\n- Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=5.5) connected to the inserter\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) with a recipe for copper cable\n- Inserter at Position (x=9.5, y=5.5) waiting for source items\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) extracting iron ore\n- Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) storing extracted iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) extracting copper ore\n- Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5) storing extracted copper ore\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup transporting water\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions providing power to connected entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a valid source of items to pick up. Check that the source inventory is not empty.\n\n### Errors with Assembling Machine Missing Resources\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has all required resources available. For copper cable production, ensure there is a sufficient supply of copper plates.\n\n### Errors with Boilers Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel boilers to maintain continuous operation. Consider automating fuel supply to prevent outages.\n\n### Errors with Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure there is a mechanism to remove processed items from the furnace to avoid production halts due to full output."}
