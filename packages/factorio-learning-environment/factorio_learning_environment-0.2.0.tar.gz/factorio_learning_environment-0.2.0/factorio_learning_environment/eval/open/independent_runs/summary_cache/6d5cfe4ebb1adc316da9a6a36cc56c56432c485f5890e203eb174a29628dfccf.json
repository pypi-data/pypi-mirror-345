{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Line at y=0.0\nConsists of four stone furnaces in a row with complete automation:\n- Furnace at x=0.0 (contains 19 coal, no ore, 18 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=-1.5 y=0.5 facing LEFT for coal input from wooden chest at x=-2.5 y=0.5 (40 coal, 9 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=0.5 y=-1.5 facing UP for ore input from wooden chest at x=0.5 y=-2.5 (20 coal, 28 iron plates)\n- Furnace at x=2.0 (contains 19 coal, no ore, 28 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=2.5 y=-1.5 facing UP for ore input from wooden chest at x=2.5 y=-2.5 (30 coal, 28 iron plates)\n  - Has output wooden chest at x=2.5 y=1.5 (empty)\n  - Has output burner inserter at x=1.5 y=1.5 facing RIGHT to move plates to the chest\n- Furnace at x=4.0 (contains 21 coal, no ore, 5 iron plates)\n  - Has input chest at x=4.5 y=-2.5 (40 coal, 19 iron ore, 26 iron plates)\n  - Has input burner inserter at x=4.5 y=-1.5 facing UP\n  - Has output wooden chest at x=4.5 y=1.5 (empty)\n  - Has output burner inserter at x=3.5 y=1.5 facing RIGHT\n- Furnace at x=6.0 (contains 21 coal, no ore, 9 iron plates)\n  - Has input chest at x=6.5 y=-2.5 (40 coal, 5 iron ore, 27 iron plates)\n  - Has input burner inserter at x=6.5 y=-1.5 facing UP\n  - Has output wooden chest at x=6.5 y=1.5 (empty)\n  - Has output burner inserter at x=5.5 y=1.5 facing RIGHT\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Entity placement collision errors\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces, account for the furnace's 2x2 tile size\n- Use appropriate spacing parameter when placing entities next to large structures\n- Check entity dimensions before attempting to place adjacent entities\n- When placing chests near furnaces, ensure there is enough space between existing structures\n- Consider alternative directions when initial placement fails due to entity collisions\n\n### Resource management errors\n- Check inventory before attempting to insert items into chests or entities\n- Keep track of consumed resources to ensure enough materials remain for planned construction\n- Verify you have required items in inventory before attempting to insert them\n- When distributing resources across multiple chests, calculate total needed amount first\n- Plan resource gathering based on the needs of all destination containers\n\n### Inserter configuration issues\n- Ensure inserters are facing the correct direction for their intended function\n- Double check inserter pickup and drop-off positions after rotation\n- Configure inserters to properly interface with both source and destination entities\n- Maintain consistent fuel levels in burner inserters to prevent operation interruption\n\n### Furnace operation\n- Monitor furnace \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings by ensuring proper ore supply\n- Maintain balanced fuel and ore supplies to all furnaces\n- Ensure input inserters can effectively feed materials into furnaces\n- Set up complete input-output chains before starting furnace operations\n- Balance resource distribution across all furnaces in the production line\n\n### Automation efficiency\n- When setting up automated systems, ensure both input and output flows are properly configured\n- Test automation with small quantities before scaling up production\n- Monitor inserter status messages to identify bottlenecks in the production line\n- Balance input and output rates to prevent backup or resource starvation\n- Verify all components of automation chains are properly fueled and oriented"}
