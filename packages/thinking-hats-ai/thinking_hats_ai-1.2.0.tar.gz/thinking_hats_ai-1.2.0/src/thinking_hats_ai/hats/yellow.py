Examples include, but are not limited to, advantages for key stakeholders, opportunities for growth, cost-effectiveness, ethical benefits, and long-term positive impacts. Find some gaps of possible value for the ideas. Tell the participants to generate ideas which increase the value for these gaps or generate a own idea which improves the benefits."
