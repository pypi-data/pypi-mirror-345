{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -25.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is intended to generate electricity, while the boiler is used to produce steam from water, and the offshore pump extracts water from the sea.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18, -49)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine at position -21.5, 25.5\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with boiler and steam engine connections\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to a water source and that the steam engine is connected to the boiler. Check for any missing pipes or connection points that may prevent the flow of steam.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with insufficient resources\n- Verify that you have the necessary resources available to operate machines, such as fuel for the boiler and ingredients for the assembling machine."}
