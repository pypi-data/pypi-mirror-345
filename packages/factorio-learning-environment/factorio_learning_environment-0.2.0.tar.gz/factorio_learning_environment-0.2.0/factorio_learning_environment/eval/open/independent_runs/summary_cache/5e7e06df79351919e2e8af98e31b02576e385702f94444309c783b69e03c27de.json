{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n---------------\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map during these steps. The agent made several attempts to craft and place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) in order to supply Automation Science Packs for research; however, each attempt failed due to inventory shortages and missing sub-ingredients. Although pre\u2010existing furnaces were utilized for smelting (an iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)), these units were not constructed by the agent and are only part of the resource-processing operations.\n\nERROR TIPS\n---------------\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage \u2013 When calling get_entities, ensure that only supported parameters are provided. Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or supplying extra positional arguments so that the function call exactly matches the defined signature.\n  \n\u2022 Entity Retrieval and Iteration \u2013 Check that functions like get_entities return valid collections before iterating over them. Guard against None values to prevent errors such as \u201c\u2018NoneType\u2019 object is not iterable.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab at a fixed position (0.5, 2.5), verify that the Lab exists in the inventory. Confirm inventory status and prerequisites to avoid placement errors due to missing items.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Prerequisites \u2013 Ensure that all sub-ingredients for Lab crafting (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available in the required quantities. Establish and verify complete production chains (including sufficient smelting of iron and copper plates) before reattempting Lab crafting to prevent shortages and cascading crafting failures."}
