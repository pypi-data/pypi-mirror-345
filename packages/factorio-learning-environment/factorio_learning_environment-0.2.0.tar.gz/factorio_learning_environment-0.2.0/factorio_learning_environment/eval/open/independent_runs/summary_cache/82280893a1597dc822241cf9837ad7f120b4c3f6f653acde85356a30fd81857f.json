{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. These furnaces are intermittently fueled and supplied with iron ore.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for general storage purposes.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing output from mining drills or furnaces are regularly emptied to prevent stoppages in production. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, which halts the mining process.\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of both fuel and raw materials to maintain productivity. The furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) is currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count`: int - Tracks the amount of iron ore extracted and inserted into furnaces.\n- `coal_count`: int - Tracks the amount of coal inserted into the burner mining drill.\n- `iron_plate_count`: int - Tracks the number of iron plates produced and stored in chests.\n\nThis report provides a concise overview of the current structures and operational errors, along with suggestions for improvements."}
