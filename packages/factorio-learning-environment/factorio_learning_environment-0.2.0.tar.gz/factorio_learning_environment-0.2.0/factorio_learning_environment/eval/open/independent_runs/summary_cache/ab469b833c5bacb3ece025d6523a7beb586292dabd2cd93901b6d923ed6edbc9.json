{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, actively producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5) with a status of waiting for space in destination, indicating a blockage in the output path.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore, connected via inserters.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) actively mining iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -48.5) and another at (-14.5, -48.5), storing mined iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for space in destination\n- Regularly check the output paths of inserters to ensure they are not blocked. This can be done by ensuring the destination entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred."}
