{"content": "The results from the most recent operations indicate that the stone furnace is still not functioning as expected. Here\u2019s a summary of the findings:\n\n### New Stone Furnace Output Status:\n- **Current Inventory**: The furnace is **empty** and shows no products produced after waiting.\n- **Current Fuel**: The furnace still has **4 pieces of coal** remaining.\n- **Energy Status**: The furnace is active with **1600.0 energy units**.\n- **Status**: The furnace indicates **\"NO INGREDIENTS,\"** despite having previously loaded **1 piece of Copper Ore**.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Total Inventory**:\n  - **10 pieces of stone furnaces**.\n  - **4 pieces of coal remaining**.\n  - **1 piece of stone** available.\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is still unable to recognize the Copper Ore as a valid ingredient for smelting, leading to the \"NO INGREDIENTS\" warning.\n- The ongoing issue suggests a fundamental problem with how the furnace is configured or how it interacts with the items loaded into it.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Furnace Configuration**: I will verify the configuration of the stone furnace to ensure it is set up to smelt Copper Ore.\n2. **Consider Alternative Methods**: If the stone furnace continues to malfunction, I may need to explore alternative furnace types that can smelt Copper Ore.\n3. **Rebuild or Reset**: If necessary, I will dismantle and rebuild the furnace again, ensuring that it is properly configured for smelting.\n\nLet\u2019s start by checking the furnace configuration again to ensure it is set up for smelting Copper Ore. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the recipe configuration of the new stone furnace to ensure it can smelt Copper Ore\nrecipe_status = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.StoneFurnace)  # Confirming what recipe is configured for the furnace\nprint(f\"Recipe Status of the new Stone Furnace: {recipe_status}\")  # Display the configured recipe status.", "summary_range": "[1-432]"}
