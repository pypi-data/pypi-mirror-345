{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid. The boiler is out of fuel.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) which is currently not receiving electricity and cannot create automation-science-pack due to missing resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to fluid systems\n- The 'PipeGroup' object does not have a 'fluid' attribute. Ensure that you are accessing the correct attributes of the objects you are working with.\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Ensure that all power-consuming entities are connected to a power source to avoid power-related warnings. Check the connections of the electricity network regularly."}
