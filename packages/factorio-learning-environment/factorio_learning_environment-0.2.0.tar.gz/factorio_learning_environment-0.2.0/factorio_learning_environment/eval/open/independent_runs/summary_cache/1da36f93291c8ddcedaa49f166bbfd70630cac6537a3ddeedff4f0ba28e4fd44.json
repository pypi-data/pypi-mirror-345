Adjust the position if necessary.\n- Verify that the intended placement area is suitable for the entity type to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined before use. Use suggestions provided by the error message to correct potential typos.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to another entity, as direct connections are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to craft or insert items into entities.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly check and manage inventories of entities like chests and furnaces to prevent overflow and ensure continuous operation."}
