{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storing mined resources.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from halting due to full drop positions. Specifically, empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have a continuous supply of iron ore to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady flow of iron ore from mining drills to furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources such as 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
