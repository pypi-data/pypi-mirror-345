{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered and working but output blocked due to no sink entity.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and actively smelting iron ore.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (16.5, 75.5), (18.5, 76.5), and (19.5, 75.5) used for output collection from the furnace.\n- Note: Attempts to place additional chests and burner inserters near the furnace failed due to collisions or existing entities.\n\n### Electricity generation setup at positions around (-9.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, connected to offshore pump by pipes and generating steam.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) consuming steam from boiler to generate electricity.\n- Small electric poles placed near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5) to distribute power.\n- Electricity network connected poles near mining drill (17.5, 69.5) to power source at steam engine (0.5, 6.5).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to item insertion into entities\n- Avoid trying to insert items into entities that do not accept them or when the entity\u2019s inventory is full. For example, the error \"Could not insert: LuaItemStack\" occurred when attempting to insert coal into a drill improperly.\n- Verify the target entity\u2019s inventory capacity and acceptance before insertion.\n\n### Errors with accessing attributes of electricity groups\n- The error `'ElectricityGroup' object has no attribute 'energy'` indicates misuse of the electricity group object.\n- Instead of checking `.energy` on electricity groups, check power availability on individual electric poles or generators.\n- Use correct API calls to verify power status.\n\n### Errors placing entities due to collisions or occupied tiles\n- Multiple attempts to place wooden chests and burner inserters near the furnace failed because the target tiles were occupied by existing entities.\n- Before placing an entity, check if the tile is free and not occupied by another entity or terrain (e.g., water).\n- Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or selecting alternative adjacent tiles for placement.\n- When placing poles or inserters near existing entities, ensure no overlap occurs by verifying positions first.\n\n### Errors related to blocked output from mining drill\n- The electric mining drill reported status `WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION` and warnings about output being blocked.\n- Ensure there is a valid sink entity (e.g., inserter, chest, or belt) at the drill\u2019s output position to accept mined items.\n- Plan layout so that mined resources can be transported away without blockage.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps."}
