{"content": "Here is the updated report incorporating the latest steps:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone processing setup at position(x=-50.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-50.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-54.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-51.5, y=0.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-51.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### Expanded stone processing setup at position(x=-50.0, y=2.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-50.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-47.0, y=2.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-49.5, y=2.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-48.5, y=2.5)\n- Assembling machine (position x=-41.5, y=2.5)\n- Additional burner inserter (position x=-45.5, y=2.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-39.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Production facility at position(x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=23.0, y=20.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=21.5, y=20.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=26.5, y=20.5)\n- Assembler inserter (position x=24.5, y=20.5)\n- Output chest (position x=28.5, y=20.5)\n- Small electric pole (position x=26.5, y=18.5)\n\n### Partial power plant at position(x=24.5, y=17.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler (position x=24.5, y=17.0)\n- Small electric pole network (positions x=26.5,y=18.5 and x=28.5,y=18.5)\n- Pipe network connecting to offshore pump (positions x=-8.5,y=-0.5 to x=22.5,y=17.5)\n\n### Stone collection point at position(x=-45.5, y=22.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position x=-45.5, y=22.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=22.5)\n- Transport belt network (positions x=-45.5,y=21.5 to x=-43.5,y=23.5)\n\n### New mining operation at position(x=-46.0, y=15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=15.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-42.0, y=15.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=14.5)\n- Transport belt (position x=-45.5, y=16.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid connection errors (new)\n- ElectricityGroup objects cannot be used for fluid connections - only use PipeGroups or individual pipe entities\n- Verify target entity type supports fluid connections before attempting connections\n\n### Belt connection issues (continued)\n- Transport belts cannot directly connect to mining drills - use inserters as intermediaries\n- Belt paths must be continuous and unobstructed for successful connections\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting new connections (multiple issues at x=-45.5,y=16.5 and x=-45.5,y=21.5)\n\n### Placement validation errors (continued)\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones (failed burner mining drill placements at x=-46.0,y=15.0 and x=-46.5,y=14.5)\n- Implement position scanning to find nearest valid placement location\n- Remove existing entities before attempting to place new ones in same position\n\n### Power system problems (continued)\n- Assembling machine at x=26.5,y=20.5 still not receiving power - complete power plant construction\n- Verify all electrical connections in the pole network\n\n### Inserter issues (continued)\n- Multiple inserters blocked due to full or obstructed belts (x=-44.5,y=14.5 and x=-44.5,y=22.5)\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels to prevent stalling\n- Verify inserter pickup/drop positions are accessible before operation\n\n### Production bottlenecks\n- Multiple furnaces reporting no ingredients despite available resources - check inserter configurations\n- Assembling machine cannot produce stone walls due to missing stone bricks - verify supply chain"}
