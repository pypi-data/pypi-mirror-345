Check that there are no missing connections or misaligned pipes.\n\n### Errors Placing Boiler\n- Verify that the target location for placing the boiler is clear of obstacles and not on unplaceable terrain such as water. Consider repositioning the boiler to a suitable location.\n\n### Errors with Entity Connection\n- Ensure that all entities, such as steam engines and boilers, are properly connected to the electricity network and fluid systems. Check for any disconnections or misalignments.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to a power source and are receiving electricity. Check the electricity network for any disconnections or lack of power supply."}
