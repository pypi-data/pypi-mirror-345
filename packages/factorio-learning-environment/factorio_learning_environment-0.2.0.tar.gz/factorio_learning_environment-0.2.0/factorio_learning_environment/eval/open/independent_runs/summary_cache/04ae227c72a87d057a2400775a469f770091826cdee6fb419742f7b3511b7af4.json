{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-12.5, y=-49.5) which transfers items from the chest to the furnace. It picks up items from position (x=-13.5, y=-49.5) and drops them at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) used for storing items before they are inserted into the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For instance, trying to insert iron ore or coal into the furnace without having them in your inventory results in an error.\n\n### Errors When Refueling\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of your inserters and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production. This can be mitigated by maintaining a steady supply of fuel in your inventory and refueling entities before they run out.\n\n### Errors When Entities Are Out of Fuel\n- Monitor the status of your entities for warnings such as \"out of fuel\" and take corrective actions promptly to ensure continuous operation."}
