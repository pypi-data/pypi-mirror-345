In this case, 'shift_entity' is not defined.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the position where you want to place a new entity is valid and not occupied by another entity. The error indicates that the new steam engine could not be placed at the desired position.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Check the positions of the entities you are trying to connect with pipes. Ensure that the connection points are valid and that there are no obstructions preventing the connection. The error indicates a failure to connect the pipe from the offshore pump to the steam engine."}
