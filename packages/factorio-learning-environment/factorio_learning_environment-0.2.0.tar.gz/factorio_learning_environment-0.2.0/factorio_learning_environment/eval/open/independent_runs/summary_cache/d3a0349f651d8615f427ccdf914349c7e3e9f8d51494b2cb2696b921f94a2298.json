{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace (position 4.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace (position 6.0, 0.0) with no fuel and no ingredients to smelt\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, the agent failed to craft a second stone furnace due to insufficient iron plates.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Make sure to check your inventory for the required items before inserting them into the furnaces. The agent encountered errors when trying to insert iron ore and coal into the furnaces without having those items available.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Confirm that the target position is free before placing a new entity. The agent successfully placed multiple stone furnaces but should ensure there are no obstructions in the future.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items to avoid errors related to distance.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it to avoid placement errors."}
