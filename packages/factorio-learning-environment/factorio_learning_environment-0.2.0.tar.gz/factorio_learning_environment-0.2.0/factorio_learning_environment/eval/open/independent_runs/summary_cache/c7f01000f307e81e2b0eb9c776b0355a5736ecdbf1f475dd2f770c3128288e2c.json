{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for items on the ground that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from incorrect positions\n- Verify the position of the entity before attempting to retrieve it. Ensure the coordinates match the actual location of the entity on the map.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or conveyor belt) to accept the output from production entities like drills and furnaces to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at incorrect locations\n- Double-check the desired location for placing entities like Burner Inserters and Transport Belts to ensure they are placed correctly and can function as intended."}
