{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Chests**:\n  - Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Wooden chests at various positions storing iron plates, some of which are full, indicating a need for better inventory management.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0), fueled with coal, currently working and connected to a wooden chest at (4.5, -58.5) which is full, preventing further mining.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Issues\n- Ensure that chests used for storage have enough capacity to prevent overflow. Full chests can halt production processes, as seen with the burner mining drill and iron plate storage.\n\n### Resource Allocation\n- Regularly check and manage the distribution of resources such as coal and iron ore to maintain continuous operation of furnaces and mining drills.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int, represents the amount of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate`: int, represents the amount of iron plates produced and stored.\n- `coal`: int, represents the amount of coal harvested and used as fuel."}
