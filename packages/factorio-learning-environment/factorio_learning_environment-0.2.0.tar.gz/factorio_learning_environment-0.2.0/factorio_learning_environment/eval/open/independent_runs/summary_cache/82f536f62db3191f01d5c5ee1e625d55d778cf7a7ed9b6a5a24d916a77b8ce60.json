{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Updated)\n- **Pumpjack** at position (17.5, 40.5) - Now unpowered due to power network issues (was previously working)\n- **Oil Refinery** at position (24.5, 44.5) - Still unpowered despite multiple connection attempts\n- **Chemical Plant** at position (31.5, 46.5) - Unpowered and missing coal input for plastic production\n- Pipe networks:\n  - Crude oil pipes from pumpjack to refinery (system 12891, status: EMPTY)\n  - Petroleum gas pipes from refinery to chemical plant (system 12894, status: EMPTY)\n\n### Coal Mining Operation\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at position (34.5, 20.5) - Unpowered with coal on belts (23 units)\n- Transport belt system moving coal towards chemical plant (status: WORKING)\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Rebuilding)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-9.5, 0.5) - New placement, not yet connected (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Previous power generation at (-9.5, -0.5) appears dismantled\n- No currently operational power generation\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical Power System Failures\n- Entire power network is down - verify steam engine placement and boiler connections\n- Multiple failed boiler placements at (-9.0, 0.0) and (-9.0, 1.0) - clear space before placement\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) shows \"no fluid present\" warning - ensure proper water source connection\n\n### Persistent Oil Facility Issues\n- All oil processing buildings now unpowered - prioritize restoring base power first\n- Pipe systems show EMPTY status - verify connections after power restoration\n- Chemical plant requires coal input - connect coal belt system after power is restored\n\n### Common Implementation Errors\n- Repeated attempts to subscript ElectricityGroup object - use proper API methods for power network access\n- Multiple assertion failures without corrective action - implement fallback procedures\n- Not verifying entity positions before interaction - always check position validity\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Attempted to use medium-electric-pole when none were available (inventory shows only small poles)\n- Verify required materials before attempting builds\n\n### System Verification\n- Check entity.neighbours lists for proper connection points\n- Monitor fluid_system status indicators (EMPTY/WORKING)\n- Verify power connections with entity.energy checks before proceeding"}
