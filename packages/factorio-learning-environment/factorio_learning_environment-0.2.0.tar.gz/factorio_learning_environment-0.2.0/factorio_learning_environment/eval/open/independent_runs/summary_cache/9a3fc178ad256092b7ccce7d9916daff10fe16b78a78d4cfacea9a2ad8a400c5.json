{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace 1 at position (-14.0, -49.0) and Furnace 2 at position (-12.0, -48.0).\n- Burner inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), and (-14.5, -43.5) for feeding coal and iron ore into the furnaces.\n- Transport belts connecting the furnaces to the iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5).\n- Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (-3.5, 23.5).\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5).\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5).\n- Connected pipes and small electric poles for electricity distribution.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- Belt group connecting various entities, including a belt from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) and another from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter at position (-11.5, -45.5) has a clear path to drop items into the destination. Adjust the neighboring entities to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items\n- Before attempting to extract items from a furnace, verify that the furnace contains the items you intend to extract. This will prevent errors related to missing items.\n\n### Efficient Use of Inserters\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner inserters to ensure they are operational. Keep an eye on their status to avoid downtime in production.\n\nThese tips should help streamline operations and reduce errors in the future."}
