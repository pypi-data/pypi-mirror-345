{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, currently holding 60 iron plates.\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) and another at (16.5, 0.5) connected to the furnace, but not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Small electric pole at position (17.5, -0.5) intended to power the inserters.\n\n### Fluid Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 19.5) and another at (-8.5, 23.5), both empty and not connected to any active fluid source.\n\n### Electricity Infrastructure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions such as (3.5, 14.5), (9.5, 17.5), and (-16.5, 19.5), currently not supplying power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing mining drills\n- Ensure the target position for placing mining drills is not occupied and is suitable for the drill's size. Consider reducing the BuildingBox size or using multiple smaller ones if space is constrained.\n\n### Errors in power infrastructure setup\n- Verify that all components such as pipes and boilers are correctly aligned and connected. Ensure that the offshore pump is properly connected to the boiler to facilitate water flow.\n\n### Errors in connecting power to inserters\n- Confirm that steam engines are placed at the specified positions and are operational. Ensure that the electric poles are correctly positioned to supply power to inserters.\n\n### Pathfinding errors\n- When setting up mining drills and chests, ensure that the pathfinding goal positions are reachable and within the map's boundaries. Adjust the path request parameters if necessary."}
