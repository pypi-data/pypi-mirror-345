{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** from position (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to a second wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied\n- Ensure there is adequate space before placing an entity. Adjust spacing or direction if another entity occupies the intended position.\n\n### Errors with inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from non-belt entities\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from non-belt entities like chests to belts, as belts cannot connect directly to these entities.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required raw materials\n- Gather necessary raw materials, such as wood, before attempting to craft items that require them."}
