{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) (Status: NO_FUEL)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) (Status: WORKING)\n- Pipe Group connecting various components, including:\n  - Pipe Group at position (-4.5, 16.5) (Status: EMPTY)\n  - Pipe Group at position (-9.5, 23.5) (Status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n\n### Electric Network\nConsists of a network of Small Electric Poles:\n- Small Electric Pole at position (-3.5, 18.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (1.5, 20.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (-1.5, 19.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (-1.5, 21.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (0.5, 18.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (0.5, 20.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (0.5, 23.5)\n- The network is not fully connected to the electricity group (Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) (Status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting and Inventory Management\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, copper plates are needed to craft copper cables, which are necessary for crafting small electric poles.\n- Verify that there are enough resources in the inventory before attempting to insert them into machines like the stone furnace.\n\n### Errors in Electric Network Connection\n- Make sure all electric poles are properly connected to form a complete network. This includes ensuring that each pole is connected to another pole or a power source.\n- Verify that the electricity group is properly connected to the electric network to avoid the NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK status.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that all pipes are properly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. This will prevent errors like \"Pipe group is not properly connected.\"\n- Double-check the connections to ensure that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors in Resource Extraction\n- Move closer to the target entity when attempting to extract items to avoid errors related to being too far from the entity.\n- Ensure that the stone furnace contains the necessary ingredients before attempting to extract copper plates from it."}
