{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nUse-case: Processes iron ore into iron plates. The furnace\u2019s recent operations indicate updated production parameters: in one recent production cycle, it produced 3 iron plates (below the expected minimum of 5), and its internal state shows a furnace source with 1 unit of iron ore and a result inventory holding 13 iron plates. Fuel remains supplied (8 units of coal). These observations update the ongoing monitoring of the furnace's production efficiency and inventory management.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient production output\n- Ensure production expectations are met by verifying that the processing cycle is given sufficient time to complete.\n- Monitor production parameters closely and adjust processing cycles or waiting periods to achieve target outputs.\n\n### Errors when inserting items from inventory without availability\n- Check the inventory for the required resource before attempting insertion into a structure.\n- Validate inventory contents to avoid insertion attempts with missing resources and subsequent exceptions."}
