{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer Station\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n- New wooden chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-52.5) used for managing overflow of iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Processing Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron chests at positions (x=-6.5, y=-50.5), (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Stone furnaces at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt and full furnace results.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert or place them. For example, attempting to insert iron ore when none is available in the inventory or trying to place a wooden chest without having one.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining and production stoppages. For instance, the burner mining drill is unable to continue mining because the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Errors when Crafting and Placing Entities\n- Verify inventory contents before crafting or placing entities to avoid errors related to missing items.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into a target entity. Ensure the source inventory has the items before calling this function.\n  - `place_entity`: Used to place entities on the map. Ensure the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `target_chest`: Represents the chest where items are intended to be inserted.\n  - `new_chest`: Represents the newly placed chest for overflow management.\n  - `iron_ore_to_transfer`: Quantity of iron ore intended for transfer operations."}
