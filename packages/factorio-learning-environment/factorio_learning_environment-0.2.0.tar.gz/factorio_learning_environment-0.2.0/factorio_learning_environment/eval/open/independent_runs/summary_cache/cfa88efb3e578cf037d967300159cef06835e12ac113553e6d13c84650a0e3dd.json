Consider crafting additional storage solutions if necessary.\n- Regularly check the inventory space available after transfers to avoid negative space availability.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Gather necessary raw resources before attempting to craft items. For example, wood must be gathered before crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Inserter and Drill Warnings\n- Ensure that chests connected to drills are emptied regularly to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n- Refuel inserters and drills to maintain continuous operation and avoid warnings related to waiting for source items or being out of fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- None observed in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `player_inventory_space`: int, tracks available space in player inventory after transfers.\n- `entities_on_map`: list, contains current entities and their statuses on the map.\n- `current_inventory`: dict, tracks the current inventory items and their counts."}
