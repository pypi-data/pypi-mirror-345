{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but still reporting output blockage due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore with frequent coal insertion, output inventory partially cleared regularly.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) serving as input and output storage for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Despite frequent extraction of iron plates from furnace and chests, output belt blockage warning persists, indicating possible belt or chest capacity issues.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged iron plate storage with stable power and inserter fueling.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, regularly refueled and working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, consistently generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, maintaining factory power supply.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and working, with input iron plates and output iron gear wheels present in inventories.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates to assembler.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) receiving assembled iron gear wheels.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving items between assembler and output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine inventories show accumulation of both iron plates and iron gear wheels, but no extraction of gear wheels detected, causing output chest to remain empty.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with stable power and inserter fueling, but output handling requires attention.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Output blockage and item flow issues\n- Persistent \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked\" warning for electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) indicates output belts or chests are full or blocked.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, limiting smelting throughput.\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) accumulates iron gear wheels in output inventory but no extraction occurs, leaving output chest empty.\n- To resolve, ensure output chests and belts have sufficient capacity and inserters are extracting items regularly.\n- Implement automated extraction from assembler output chest to prevent buildup and allow continuous crafting.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Some inserters report waiting for source items, indicating temporary lack of items to move.\n- Maintain steady supply of fuel and source items to keep inserters working without interruption.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous issues placing small electric poles near steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to occupied tiles remain noted.\n- Verify tile occupancy before placement and adjust placement parameters or positions to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Earlier assembling machine shortages of iron plates resolved by inserting iron plates into assembler input chest.\n- Current issue is lack of extraction of crafted iron gear wheels, causing output inventory buildup.\n- Implement extraction logic to remove crafted items promptly to maintain crafting flow.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo new utility functions defined by the agent in the recent steps."}
