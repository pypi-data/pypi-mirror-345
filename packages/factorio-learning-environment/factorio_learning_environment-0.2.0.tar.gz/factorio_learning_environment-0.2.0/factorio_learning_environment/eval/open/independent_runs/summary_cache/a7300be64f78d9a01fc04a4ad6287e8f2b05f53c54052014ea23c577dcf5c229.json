{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5), currently working but with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, y=-58.5), (5.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (8.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5) used for storing mined resources.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) used for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Each furnace has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), (-12.5, y=-50.5), (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), (-8.5, y=-50.5), (-7.5, y=-50.5), (-6.5, y=-50.5) used for storing iron plates. Some chests are full, as indicated by warnings.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that storage chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining and production processes from halting due to full inventory warnings.\n\n### Errors Related to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to continue smelting operations. This includes maintaining a supply of iron ore and coal.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore: int` - Represents the quantity of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate: int` - Represents the quantity of iron plates extracted and stored.\n- `coal: int` - Represents the quantity of coal used as fuel in the mining drill and furnaces."}
