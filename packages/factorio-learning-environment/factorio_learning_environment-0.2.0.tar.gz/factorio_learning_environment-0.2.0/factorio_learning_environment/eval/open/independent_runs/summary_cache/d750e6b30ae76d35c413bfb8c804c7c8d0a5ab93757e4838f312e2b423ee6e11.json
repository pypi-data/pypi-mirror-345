{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore to:\n    - **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, connected to:\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates to:\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), which stores iron plates.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) storing additional iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Output System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer iron plates to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'x'\n- Ensure that all local variables are properly initialized before they are accessed in the code.\n\n### Exception: Could not insert: LuaItemStack\n- Verify that the target inventory has enough space to accommodate the items being inserted.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the supply chain to ensure continuous flow of resources.\n\n### No iron ore available in destination chest for transfer\n- Ensure that the source chest has sufficient iron ore before attempting to transfer to another chest."}
