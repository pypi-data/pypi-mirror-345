{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Expanded Power System at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Output connection point at (-9.0, -0.5)\n  - Connected to pipe network at (-8.5, -0.5)\n- **Boiler cluster** (5 units)\n  - Boiler at (-8.0, 0.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Boiler at (-7.0, 1.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Boiler at (-8.0, 2.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Boiler at (-7.0, 0.5) facing RIGHT\n  - New boiler at (-5.0, -0.5) facing RIGHT\n- **Pipe network**\n  - Main line from (-9.0, -0.5) to (-8.5, -0.5)\n  - Branch to (-6.5, -0.5) for new boiler\n  - Underground pipe segment (-7.5, -0.5) to (-7.5, 0.5)\n- **Steam engine** at (-2.5, 0.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Still not connected to any boiler outputs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Steam Engine Placement Issues\n- Repeated failures placing steam engines at (-2.5, -0.5) and (-3.5, 0.5)\n  - Verify terrain is land (not water) before placement\n  - Maintain minimum 1-tile clearance around placement area\n  - Check for hidden entities in target positions\n\n### Pipe Connection Validation\n- Multiple pipe connection failures between (-9.0, -0.5) and (-6.5, -0.5)\n  - Ensure continuous pipe path exists before connection attempts\n  - Verify all intermediate pipe segments are properly placed\n  - Check for missing pipe segments in long connections\n\n### Underground Pipe Placement\n- Failed underground pipe output at (-7.0, 0.0)\n  - Clear existing entities before placing underground exits\n  - Maintain minimum 4-tile spacing between underground segments\n  - Verify underground pipe direction matches connection path\n\n### Boiler Connection Problems\n- New boiler at (-5.0, -0.5) showing \"no input liquid\" warning\n  - Verify water actually reaches boiler input connection\n  - Check pipe connections align with boiler's input side\n  - Ensure continuous water flow from pump to boiler\n\n### Placement Collision Prevention\n- Repeated placement failures due to existing entities\n  - Implement systematic area scanning before placement\n  - Clear existing entities completely before new placements\n  - Maintain minimum spacing requirements between components\n\n### Connection Point Verification\n- Multiple connection point mismatches\n  - Verify exact connection points for each entity type\n  - Offshore pump output is fixed at (-9.0, -0.5) when facing RIGHT\n  - Boiler inputs must match specific positions relative to orientation\n\n### Fluid System Validation\n- New boiler showing \"no fluid present\" warning\n  - Verify entire fluid path is properly connected\n  - Check for missing pipe segments or incorrect connections\n  - Ensure pump is actually pushing water through system"}
