Align connection attempts with the updated identifiers (e.g., 158907, 158906, etc.) used in the finalized pipeline network.\n\n\u2022 Repeated Unsuccessful Candidate Searches:\n   - Repeated searches within a 15-tile radius consistently returned 0 candidate pipe groups. Verify that spatial parameters and search radii correctly encompass the intended pipeline entities.\n\n\u2022 Expected Candidate Not Found:\n   - Connection attempts were aborted when no candidate pipe group with the specified fluid_system was found. Confirm that fluid system assignments and spatial configurations match the actual pipeline network setup before initiating connection operations."}
