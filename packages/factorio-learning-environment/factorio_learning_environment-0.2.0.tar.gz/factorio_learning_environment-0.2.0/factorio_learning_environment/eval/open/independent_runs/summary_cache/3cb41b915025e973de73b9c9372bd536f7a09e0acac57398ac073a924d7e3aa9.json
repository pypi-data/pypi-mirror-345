{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) which is currently out of fuel and has a full chest at the drop position.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) containing 225 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) containing 82 iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing 181 units of coal.\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chests.\n\n### Iron and Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace and a wooden chest.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest and a transport belt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest and a transport belt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest and a stone furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to a stone furnace and a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) containing 1052 iron plates and 450 copper plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) containing 744 copper plates.\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities in the processing facility.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Running Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that all inserters have a sufficient supply of fuel to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check and refuel inserters at positions (1.5, 3.5, 6.5, 8.5, and 11.5).\n\n### Errors with Extracting Items from Chests\n- Verify that the chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) is not full before attempting to extract items. Ensure there is space in the inventory or destination for extracted items.\n\n### Errors with Crafting Wooden Chests\n- Ensure that all required materials are available before attempting to craft wooden chests. Check the inventory for sufficient wood and other necessary resources.\n\n### Errors with Managing Storage for Coal\n- Ensure that there is available space in the destination storage before attempting to manage coal storage at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)."}
