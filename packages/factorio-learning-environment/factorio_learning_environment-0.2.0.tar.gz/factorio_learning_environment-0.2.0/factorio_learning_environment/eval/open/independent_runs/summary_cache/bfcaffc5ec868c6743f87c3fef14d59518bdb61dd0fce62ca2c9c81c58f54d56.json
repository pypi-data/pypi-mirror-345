{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), refueled with coal, extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), containing iron ore, receiving ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace, but currently misaligned.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), refueled with coal, but not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position if necessary.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is not occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Double-check the positioning and direction of inserters to ensure they can pick up and drop items as intended.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Keep an eye on fuel levels to prevent interruptions in production.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor the inventory of chests and ensure they are not full to prevent stoppages in mining operations. Regularly empty or manage the contents to maintain workflow efficiency."}
