Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### NameError Due to Undefined 'BurnerMiningDrill'\n- Ensure that the correct class or module name is used when referencing entities in code. Verify that 'BurnerMiningDrill' is properly imported or defined in the script.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items and that the source is not empty or blocked. Adjust inserter positions or ensure source availability to resolve waiting status."}
