{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Connected Pipe Group from Position (x=20.5, y=-10.5) to (x=20.5, y=-5.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions providing electrical connections\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with iron ore input\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with iron ore input\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with copper ore input\n- Inserter at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=5.5) for storage\n- Transport Belt connecting the furnace to the chest\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) with copper cable recipe\n- Inserter at Position (x=9.5, y=5.5) waiting for source items\n- Belt Group connecting inputs and outputs\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) storing extracted iron ore\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Connected Pipe Group from Position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) to (x=8.5, y=-7.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity Group with Small Electric Poles at various positions providing power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to missing resources in production\n- Ensure that all required resources are available for production processes. For example, the assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) cannot create copper cables due to missing copper plates.\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Make sure the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Inserters waiting for source items will not function until the necessary items are present."}
