{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace entity at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used to convert iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of:\n- Copper furnace entity at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) used to convert copper ore into copper plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n- API Parameter Usage:\n  - Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (such as \"radius\") or extra positional arguments to get_entities. Verify the API signature before invocation.\n\n- Lab Placement and Retrieval:\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab (e.g., at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5)), ensure that the Lab item is present in the inventory to prevent placement errors.\n  - When filtering or iterating over retrieved entities, provide a fallback to an empty list to avoid iterating over a NoneType.\n\n- Lab Crafting Failures:\n  - Multiple crafting attempts for the Lab have failed due to missing sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheel and electronic-circuit) and incomplete production chains.\n  - Ensure that all prerequisite components are sufficiently available and that resource processing (such as smelting) meets the requirements for crafting complex structures like the Lab.\n\n- Resource Processing:\n  - Maintain balanced production of intermediate resources (iron plates, copper plates, etc.) to support the crafting requirements of higher-tier items."}
