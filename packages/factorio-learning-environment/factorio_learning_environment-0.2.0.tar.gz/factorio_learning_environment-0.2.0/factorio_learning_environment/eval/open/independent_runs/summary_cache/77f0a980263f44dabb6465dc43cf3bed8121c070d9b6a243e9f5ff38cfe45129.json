{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -49.0) and (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at Position (-16.0, -49.0)**: Fueled by coal, currently working with an inventory of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- **Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)**: Fueled by coal, currently working with an inventory of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at Position (-13.5, -47.5): Supplies iron ore to the furnace at (-14.0, -49.0).\n  - Inserter at Position (-14.5, -45.5): Supplies materials to the belt system.\n  - Inserter at Position (-13.5, -45.5): Supplies materials to the belt system.\n  - Inserter at Position (-11.5, -45.5): Supplies materials to the belt system.\n  - Inserter at Position (-9.5, -44.5): Supplies materials to the belt system.\n  - Inserter at Position (-14.5, -43.5): Supplies materials to the belt system.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -46.5): Used for temporary storage.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -44.5): Stores iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Iron Chest at Position (-11.5, -44.5): Used for storage.\n- **Belt System**:\n  - Belt at Position (-16.5, -47.5) to (-16.5, -46.5): Transports materials.\n  - Belt at Position (-14.5, -46.5) to (-14.5, -47.5): Transports materials.\n  - Belt at Position (-12.5, -46.5) to (-11.5, -46.5): Transports materials.\n  - BeltGroup connecting various positions for efficient material transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Supplying Iron Ore\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply it to a furnace. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source from which an inserter is supposed to pick items is adequately stocked. This will prevent inserters from getting stuck in a \"waiting for source items\" status.\n\n### Efficient Inventory Management\n- Regularly check your inventory levels to ensure that you have enough resources to supply to your structures. This will help in maintaining a continuous production flow without interruptions."}
