{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nThis structure is responsible for generating electricity and consists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=25.5), (x=-7.5, y=24.5)]\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the Boiler to the Steam Engine with pipes at positions [(x=-5.5, y=23.5), (x=-4.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=23.5), ..., (x=-2.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5)]\n- **Small Electric Pole** at position (1.5, 25.5) connecting the Steam Engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nThis structure is used for producing iron plates and consists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (15.0, 0.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nThis system is used for transferring items and consists of:\n- **Inserter** at position (17.5, 0.5) connected to the power network\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Crafting or Connecting\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to craft or connect entities. For instance, crafting a Steam Engine or connecting entities with pipes and poles requires specific items like pipes and small electric poles.\n\n### Errors When Attempting to Connect Entities Without Required Items\n- Before attempting to connect entities such as inserters, boilers, or steam engines, verify that you have the required items in your inventory. This includes pipes for fluid connections and small electric poles for electrical connections.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Required Inventory\n- Make sure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like boilers. For example, inserting coal into a boiler requires coal to be present in your inventory."}
