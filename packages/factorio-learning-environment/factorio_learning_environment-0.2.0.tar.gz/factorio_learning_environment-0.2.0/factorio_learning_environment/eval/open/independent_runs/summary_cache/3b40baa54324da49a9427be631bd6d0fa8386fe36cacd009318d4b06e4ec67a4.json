{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=1.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=4.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=8.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric poles distributing power\n\nThis structure generates electricity by pumping water from a nearby water source, heating it in the boiler to produce steam, which then powers the steam engine. Currently, the boiler is out of fuel and the steam engine is not properly connected to the power network.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at position (16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Collection chest (position x=16.5, y=1.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=17.5, y=1.5)\n\nThis structure mines coal from a coal patch. The burner mining drill extracts coal and places it into the collection chest. The burner inserter takes coal from the chest but currently has no valid output destination. The mining drill is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Iron Processing Complex at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=15.5, y=70.5)\n- Iron ore collection chest (position x=15.5, y=72.5)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace (position x=16.0, y=74.0)\n  - Second furnace (position x=12.0, y=74.0)\n- Multiple inserters for material movement:\n  - Burner inserter (position x=16.5, y=72.5) to move ore from chest to first furnace\n  - Burner inserter (position x=14.5, y=74.5) to move items to first furnace\n  - Burner inserter (position x=13.5, y=73.5) to move ore to second furnace\n  - Inserter (position x=17.5, y=73.5) to move iron plates to first assembling machine\n  - Inserter (position x=13.5, y=74.5) to move plates from second furnace\n- Two assembling machines for iron gear wheel production:\n  - First assembling machine (position x=19.5, y=73.5)\n  - Second assembling machine (position x=19.5, y=77.5)\n- Output inserters:\n  - Inserter (position x=21.5, y=73.5) to move gear wheels from first assembler to output chest\n  - Inserter (position x=21.5, y=77.5) to move gear wheels from second assembler\n- Output chest (position x=22.5, y=73.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting the electrical components\n\nThis complex structure mines iron ore, smelts it into iron plates in two separate furnaces, and then assembles the plates into iron gear wheels using two assembling machines. The electric mining drill extracts iron ore and places it into a collection chest. The ore is then moved to the furnaces for smelting, with the resulting iron plates being fed into the assembling machines to create iron gear wheels, which are then stored in the output chest. Currently, the system is experiencing power issues, with most electrical components showing \"NO_POWER\" status.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- Use the entity map to identify existing entities and their positions\n- Try different coordinates around the target area if you encounter \"Could not find a suitable position\" errors\n- When placing inserters, ensure you're accounting for the space needed by all nearby entities\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Ensure there is a continuous power network connecting all electrical entities\n- When connecting distant entities, place intermediate power poles to maintain connection\n- Make sure the boiler is fueled with coal to generate steam for the steam engine\n- Check that pipes are properly connected between the boiler and steam engine for steam flow\n- Verify that all electrical components show \"WORKING\" status rather than \"NO_POWER\"\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes and fluids\n- When connecting the boiler to the steam engine"}
