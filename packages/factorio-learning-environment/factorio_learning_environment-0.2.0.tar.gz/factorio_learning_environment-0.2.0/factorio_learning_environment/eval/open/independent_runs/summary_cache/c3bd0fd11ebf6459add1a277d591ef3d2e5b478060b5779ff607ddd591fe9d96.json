{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-3.0, 1.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-1.5, 1.5) transferring iron ore from a chest to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) storing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) collecting iron ore from the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -53.5) used to unblock the inserter.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) collecting coal from the mining drill.\n\n### Belt Transport System\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- Belt Group 1: Connects from (x=-0.5, y=-0.5) to (x=1.5, y=-0.5) and from (x=0.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=1.5), facilitating movement of items.\n- Belt Group 2: Connects from (x=2.5, y=0.5) to (x=2.5, y=-1.5) and from (x=2.5, y=-0.5) to (x=4.5, y=-0.5), facilitating movement of items.\n- Belt Group 3: Connects from (x=0.5, y=2.5) to (x=2.5, y=2.5) and from (x=1.5, y=1.5) to (x=3.5, y=1.5), facilitating movement of items.\n- Belt Group 4: Connects from (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) and from (x=-5.5, y=-0.5) to (x=-3.5, y=-0.5), facilitating movement of items.\n\n### New Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-1.0, 1.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when picking up entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to pick up exists at the specified position. In the logs, attempts to pick up a transport belt at position (-2, 1) failed because no belt was present there.\n\n### Inserter Functionality Issues\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and have access to source items. Several logs indicate that the inserter was not functioning properly due to misalignment or lack of source items.\n\n### Furnace Output Blockage\n- Regularly check and clear any blockages at the furnace output to ensure continuous production of iron plates. Logs indicate repeated issues with furnace output blockages.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the items you are trying to insert are available in your inventory. Logs show errors when attempting to insert coal and iron ore into the furnace without having them in the inventory.\n\n### Furnace Fuel Management\n- Monitor the fuel levels in the furnace to prevent overfilling, which can lead to warnings and inefficient operation. Logs indicate warnings about the furnace fuel source being full.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure that the entity contains the items you are trying to extract. Logs indicate errors when attempting to extract iron plates from the furnace, which did not contain any at the time.\n\n### Furnace Resource Management\n- Ensure that both iron ore and coal are present in the furnace to maintain production. Logs indicate that the furnace often lacked coal, preventing it from producing iron plates.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. Logs show errors when trying to place burner mining drills without having them in inventory.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. Logs show a `NameError` due to the use of an undefined variable `crafted_quantity`.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect argument types\n- Ensure that the correct types are passed to functions. Logs indicate an `AssertionError` when attempting to insert items with incorrect argument types."}
