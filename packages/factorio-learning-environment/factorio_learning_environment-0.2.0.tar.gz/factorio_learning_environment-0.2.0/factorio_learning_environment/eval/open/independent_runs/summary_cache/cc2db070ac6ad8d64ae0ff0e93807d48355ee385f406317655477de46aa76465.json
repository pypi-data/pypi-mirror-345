{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) for transferring items between chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) for transferring iron plates from the furnace to storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to undefined entities\n- Ensure that all entities referenced in your code are correctly defined and initialized before use. For instance, the error \"name 'Chest' is not defined\" indicates that the entity 'Chest' was not properly set up.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly check the inventory status of entities like furnaces to prevent attempts to insert items when the inventory is full. This will avoid errors such as \"Failed to insert iron-plate into stone-furnace at position {x = -10, y = -48}.\"\n\n### Errors due to unbound local variables\n- Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and associated with a value before they are accessed in your code. This will prevent errors like \"UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'x' where it is not associated with a value.\"\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that there is a continuous supply of source items for inserters to avoid them waiting idly. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady flow of resources to the inserters' pickup positions."}
