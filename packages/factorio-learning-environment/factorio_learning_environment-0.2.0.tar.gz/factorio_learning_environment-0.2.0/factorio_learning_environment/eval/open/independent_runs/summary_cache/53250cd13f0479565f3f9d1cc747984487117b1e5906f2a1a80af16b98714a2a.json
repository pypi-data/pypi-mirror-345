{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (15.5,72.5) storing iron ore (currently contains 15 iron ore)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at (-46.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (-46.5,70.5) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-46.5,72.5) storing copper ore (currently contains 16 copper ore)\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,-0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,-0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-5.0,-0.5) converting water to steam (currently has coal fuel)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5,-0.5) generating electricity\n- Pipe network connecting the components (currently not fully functional)\n\n### Iron Smelting Operation at (16.0,71.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0,71.0) extracting iron ore (fueled with coal, output blocked)\n- Stone furnace at (17.0,73.0) smelting iron plates (working with coal fuel but no ingredients)\n- Wooden chest at (18.5,72.5) storing output (empty)\n- Wooden chest at (16.5,72.5) storing iron ore (contains 2 iron ore)\n\n### Copper Mining Operation at (-46.0,71.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-46.0,71.0) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-46.5,72.5) storing copper ore\n\n### Smelting Setups\n- Stone furnace at (100.0,100.0) with wooden chest at (98.5,100.5) (no ingredients)\n- Stone furnace at (300.0,300.0) with wooden chest at (298.5,300.5) (no ingredients)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues\n- Repeated failed attempts to place burner inserters at (17.5,72.5) and (17.5,73.5) (steps 104-114)\n- Failed wooden chest placement at (17.5,72.5) and (17.5,73.5) (steps 111,115)\n- Failed burner mining drill placement at (50.0,50.0) due to terrain (step 119)\n- Always verify target position is clear before placing entities\n- Check terrain suitability before placement attempts\n- Consider alternative positions or remove blocking objects first\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Furnaces remain without ingredients (steps 106-119)\n- Burner mining drill output still blocked (steps 107-119)\n- Ensure proper material flow from mining to smelting operations\n- Verify inserter placement and orientation for furnace input/output\n\n### Entity Inspection Errors\n- Repeated attempts to inspect non-existent chest at (18.5,72.5) (steps 112-117)\n- Verify entity existence before attempting inspection\n- Handle missing entities gracefully in code\n\n### Insertion Failures\n- Failed to insert iron ore due to missing recipient (step 118)\n- Ensure target entity exists and can accept items before insertion\n\n### Existing Issues from Previous Report\n- Power system still not fully functional\n- Continue addressing these persistent issues\n\n### System Design Best Practices\n- Maintain proper spacing between components\n- Verify all connections before testing systems\n- Plan material flow paths before placement\n- Consider using electric inserters instead of burner inserters for reliability"}
