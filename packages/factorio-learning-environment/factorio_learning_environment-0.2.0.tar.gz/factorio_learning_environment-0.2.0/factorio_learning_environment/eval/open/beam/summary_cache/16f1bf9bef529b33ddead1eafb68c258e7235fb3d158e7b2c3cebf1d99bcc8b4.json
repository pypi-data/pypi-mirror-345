Here is the updated status:\n\n### Current Furnace Status:\n1. **First Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 10 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 6 (remaining for processing)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 48 (total)\n   - Status: WORKING (actively producing)\n\n2. **Second Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 12 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 9 (available for processing)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 23 (total)\n   - Status: WORKING (currently processing)\n\n### Summary:\n- Both furnaces are operational and actively processing iron ore, contributing to our total iron plate production.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Continue monitoring the production output of both furnaces.\n2. Consider gathering more iron ore or coal if production slows down or if we plan to expand operations.\n3. Once we have a sufficient amount of iron plates, we can strategize on crafting additional entities to enhance our factory setup.\n\nLet's keep an eye on the production cycle and see how many iron plates are produced in the next few moments.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the furnaces to process their iron ore\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration as needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-88]"}
