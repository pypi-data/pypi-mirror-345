This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory when inserting items.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert iron ore into a coal furnace\n- Verify that the target furnace is intended for the type of material you are inserting. Inserting iron ore into a coal furnace may not be appropriate unless the furnace is configured to handle multiple material types."}
