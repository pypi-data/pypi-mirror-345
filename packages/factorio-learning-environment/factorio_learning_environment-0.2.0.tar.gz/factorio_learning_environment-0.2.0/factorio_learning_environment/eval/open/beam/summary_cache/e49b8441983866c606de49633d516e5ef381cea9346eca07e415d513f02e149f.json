{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe furnace currently holds **9 pieces of iron plates** and is now marked as **\"NO_INGREDIENTS,\"** indicating that it has no items to process and cannot accept any more resources at this time.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 3 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 2 pieces of coal remaining for fuel\n- 5 pieces of copper ore\n- 5 pieces of iron ore (currently unable to insert)\n- **3 pieces of iron plates** produced.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not processing any items due to a lack of ingredients, which explains why it cannot accept the iron ore.\n- The current state of the furnace suggests that it needs to be cleared out before new materials can be processed.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Crafting with Iron Plates**: I can utilize the 3 iron plates to craft items if any recipes are available. \n2. **Consider Storage for Iron Ore**: Since the furnace cannot accept the iron ore, I should consider placing it in a storage container (like a chest) until it can be processed later.\n3. **Gather More Resources**: I can also focus on gathering additional resources or preparing for future crafting opportunities.\n\nLet's check for any available crafting recipes that can utilize the iron plates I currently have.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for available recipes that can be crafted using iron plates\navailable_recipe_iron_gear_wheel = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.IronGearWheel)\nprint(f\"Recipe for Iron Gear Wheel: {available_recipe_iron_gear_wheel}\")\n\navailable_recipe_small_lamp = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.SmallLamp)\nprint(f\"Recipe for Small Lamp: {available_recipe_small_lamp}\")\n\n# Check if there are any other recipes available for crafting with iron plates\navailable_recipes = get_all_recipes()  # This function should return all available recipes\nprint(f\"Available crafting recipes: {available_recipes}\")  # Display all available recipes.", "summary_range": "[1-186]"}
