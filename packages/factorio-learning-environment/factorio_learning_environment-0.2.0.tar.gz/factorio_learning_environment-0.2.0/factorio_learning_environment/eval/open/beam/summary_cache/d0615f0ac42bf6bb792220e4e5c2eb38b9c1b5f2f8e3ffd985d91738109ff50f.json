Checks if we can craft a burner mining drill\n2. If we can't, moves to manual mining to get resources\n3. Sets up a furnace to smelt the iron ore\n4. Tries to get enough iron plates to eventually craft the burner mining drill\n\nLet's see what resources we're missing to craft the burner mining drill.", "summary_range": "[1-2314]"}
