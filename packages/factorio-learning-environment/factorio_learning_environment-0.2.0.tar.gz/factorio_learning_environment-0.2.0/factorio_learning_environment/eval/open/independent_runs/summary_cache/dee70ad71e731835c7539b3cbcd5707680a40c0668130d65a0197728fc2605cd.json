{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 1 at position(8.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear input:\n  - Wooden chest at position(8.5, 10.5) containing iron gears\n  - Burner inserter at position(8.5, 11.5) moving gears to assembler\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter at position(10.5, 13.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position(11.5, 13.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting various parts with 11 belts\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-4.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-3.5, 27.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting water and steam\n- Electric pole network with multiple poles covering the production area\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at various locations:\n1. Setup at x=41, y=-82:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n2. Setup at x=-28, y=-61:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5) with iron plates\n   - Burner inserter at (-23.5, -58.5)\n\n3. Setup at x=-18, y=-53:\n   - Similar mining and smelting setup with burner mining drill, inserters, furnace and chests\n\n4. Copper smelting setup at x=14, y=14:\n   - Stone furnace at (14.0, 14.0)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - common collisions with:\n  - Transport belts\n  - Wooden chests\n  - Electric poles\n  - Stone furnaces\n- Increase spacing parameter when placing entities next to each other\n- Consider different directions when the desired placement direction is blocked\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drills are out of fuel - ensure regular fuel supply\n- Assembling machine lacks copper plates for automation science pack production\n- Ensure proper material flow through the production line\n\n### Entity Positioning\n- When placing chests and inserters, verify the entire input/output chain has proper spacing and positioning\n- Consider the full dimensions of larger entities (assemblers, boilers) when planning adjacent structures\n\n### Infrastructure Planning\n- Plan proper spacing for production lines to avoid entity overlap\n- Consider future expansion when placing initial structures\n- Ensure proper connections between different production stages"}
