{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nComplex mining setup consisting of:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), (-6, -59)\n- Storage chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for ore movement at (-9.5, -56.5), (-7.5, -56.5), (-6.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -56.5)\n- Transport belt network connecting the mining area\nThe system is actively mining iron ore with main storage chest at (-5.5, -57.5) containing 708 iron ore\n\n### Copper/Iron Processing Station at (-28, -61)\nProcessing station consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61)\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59)\n- Storage chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing processed plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving items from furnace to chest\n- Additional furnaces at (-23, -58) and (-21, -58) for expanded processing\n- Burner inserter at (-22.5, -56.5) for output management\n- Storage chest at (-22.5, -55.5) for processed plates\n\n### Main Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nLarge smelting array consisting of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserters for input at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Burner inserters for output at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\nConnected by extensive belt network from mining area\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Connection Errors\n- Cannot connect belts directly to chests, must use inserters as intermediaries\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a position\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, ensure proper spacing and direction\n- Consider using different spacing values or directions if initial placement fails\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Multiple inserters are waiting for source items, ensure proper input supply\n- Some inserters are blocked due to missing output containers\n- Make sure inserters have both valid pickup and drop-off positions\n\n### Resource Flow Problems\n- Several furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n- Ensure complete material flow paths from source to destination\n- Check that all parts of production chains are properly connected"}
