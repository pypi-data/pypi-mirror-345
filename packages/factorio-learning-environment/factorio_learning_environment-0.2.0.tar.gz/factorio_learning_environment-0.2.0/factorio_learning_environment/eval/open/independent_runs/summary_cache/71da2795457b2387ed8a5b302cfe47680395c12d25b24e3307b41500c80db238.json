{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel. The furnace has 48 units of coal in the fuel inventory and is actively working. It currently contains no ingredients to smelt and has 6 iron plates in the output inventory.\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (6.5, -57.5) with no power. The lab is set to research automation but is currently inactive due to lack of power.\n- Small Electric Pole at position (6.5, -55.5) intended to power the lab, but currently not supplying power due to lack of connection to a power source.\n\n### Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine Setup at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with water present in connections. It is connected to a fluid system and working.\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with coal as fuel. It is generating steam and connected to the offshore pump via pipes.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) connected to the boiler. It is not currently connected to the power network and has no input liquid or fluid present in connections.\n\n### Pipe Group for Fluid Transport\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) to the boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0). The pipe group includes connections at positions (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and (-7.5, 24.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to place is available in your inventory. For example, attempting to place a steam engine failed because there was no steam engine in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all the necessary materials before attempting to craft an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, but the agent had 0 stones available, leading to a crafting failure. Similarly, the agent was missing 3 copper plates needed to craft copper cables.\n- Ensure you have enough iron plates before crafting. An error occurred due to missing 4 iron plates needed to craft a steam engine.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace failed because there was no coal in the inventory at that time.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient extraction of items\n- Ensure that the required number of items are available for extraction. For example, an assertion error occurred because the agent attempted to extract 10 iron plates but only 9 were available. Always check the available quantity before extraction to avoid such errors.\n- Ensure that the entity from which you are attempting to extract items actually contains those items. For example, an error occurred when trying to extract iron plates from the stone furnace at (6.0, -62.0) because it did not contain any iron plates.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect argument types\n- Ensure that you are passing the correct argument types to functions. An error occurred because a position was passed instead of an Entity or EntityGroup. Always check the function documentation to confirm the expected argument types.\n\n### Errors due to furnace not working after restocking\n- Ensure that the furnace has all necessary ingredients and conditions to start working after restocking. The agent restocked the furnace with coal, but it did not start working because there were no ingredients to smelt. Always verify that the furnace has both fuel and ingredients.\n\n### Errors due to missing iron ore in inventory\n- Ensure that you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. An error occurred because there was no iron ore in the inventory to insert into the furnace. Always check your inventory for the required materials before attempting to insert them into a furnace.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect inventory assertion\n- Ensure that the inventory assertion checks are correctly implemented. An assertion error occurred because the check for iron ore in the furnace inventory was incorrect. Always verify that the logic for inventory assertions aligns with the actual inventory state to prevent such errors.\n\n### Errors due to missing items for assembling machine\n- Ensure that all required items are available in the inventory before attempting to craft or assemble. An error was noted due to missing iron plates and electronic circuits needed for an assembling machine. Always check the inventory for necessary components before starting an assembly process.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes without valid positions\n- Ensure that there is"}
