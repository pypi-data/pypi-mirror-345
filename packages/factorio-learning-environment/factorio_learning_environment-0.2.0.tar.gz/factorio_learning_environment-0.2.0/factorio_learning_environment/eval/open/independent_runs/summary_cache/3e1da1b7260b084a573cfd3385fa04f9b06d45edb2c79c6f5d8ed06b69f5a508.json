(Status: FULL_OUTPUT; Warnings: [\u201cno input liquid\u201d, \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d])\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) for water extraction; connection point: (-9.5, 23.5).\n- Steam engine at position(-1.5, 26.5) for electricity generation; connection points: (1.0, 26.5) and (-4.0, 26.5); Warnings: [\u201cnot connected to power network\u201d, \u201cno input liquid\u201d, \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d].\n- Pipe network elements:\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=864, water) at position(-8.5, 23.5) with pipes at [(-8.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 22.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-6.5, 22.5), (-7.5, 22.5), (-5.5, 22.5)] (Status: FULL_OUTPUT).\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=867) at position(-3.5, 23.5) with pipes at [(-3.5, 23.5)] (Status: EMPTY).\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=866, steam) at position(-7.5, 25.5) with pipes at [(-7.5, 25.5), (-7.5, 24.5)] (Status: FULL_OUTPUT).\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=869, steam) at position(-0.5, 28.5) with pipes at [(-0.5, 28.5)] (Status: EMPTY).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Steam Engine and Pipe Connection Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that steam engine connection placements avoid water interference and footprint collisions.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that connection points at the boiler\u2019s steam output and the steam engine are clear and compatible.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm fluid compatibility so that the source (e.g. pipe output) matches target expectations, preventing errors like \u201cFluids currently at source \u2026 not needed and expected by the target.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Pipe Connection Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Check that connection point pairs\u2014such as those between the offshore pump and boiler\u2014are unblocked and properly aligned.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that neither source nor target has extraneous obstructions before establishing direct entity connections.\n\n\u2022 Manual Pipeline Placement Challenges:\n\u2003\u2013 When placing manual pipeline segments, move close to the target positions to avoid errors related to exceeding the maximum placement distance.\n\u2003\u2013 Inspect target locations for existing entities or terrain issues (e.g. overlapping water footprints) that prevent placement. Remove or reposition any interfering objects before reattempting.\n\u2003\u2013 Use alternate buildable area methods only after ensuring the candidate location aligns well with the intended pipeline route.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Management and Network Stabilization:\n\u2003\u2013 Continuously maintain an adequate fuel supply for the boiler to avoid operational halts.\n\u2003\u2013 Allow sufficient waiting periods after connections or adjustments to let the fluid network stabilize before reattempting further placements or connections."}
