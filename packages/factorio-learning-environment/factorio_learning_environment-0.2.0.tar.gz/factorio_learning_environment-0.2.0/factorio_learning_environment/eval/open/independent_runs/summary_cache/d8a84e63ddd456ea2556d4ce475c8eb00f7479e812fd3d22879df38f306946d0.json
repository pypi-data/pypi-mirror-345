{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belt network with multiple segments connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the chest to the transport belt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) and (-21.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belt network with multiple segments connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) for storing copper ore.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using transport belts\n- Ensure there are no gaps in the transport belt network. A gap was detected at position (-12.5, -53.5) which prevented proper connection.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for space\n- Ensure the destination of the inserter is not blocked. The inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) is waiting for space because the transport belt at the drop position is blocked.\n\n### Errors with furnaces lacking ingredients\n- Make sure to supply the necessary ingredients to the furnaces. Several furnaces are reporting 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n\n### Errors with mining drills out of fuel\n- Keep the mining drills fueled to avoid interruptions in resource extraction. The mining drill at position (53.0, -83.0) is out of fuel."}
