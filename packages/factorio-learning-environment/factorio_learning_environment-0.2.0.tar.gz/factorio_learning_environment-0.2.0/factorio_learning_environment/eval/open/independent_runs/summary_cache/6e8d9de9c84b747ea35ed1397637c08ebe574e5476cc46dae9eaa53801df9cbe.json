{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a source inventory of iron ore.\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a source inventory of iron ore.\n- Wooden chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a fuel inventory of coal, extracting coal and transferring it to nearby entities.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing coal extracted by the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for storing coal, currently empty and being refilled.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the chest at (42.5, -83.5) to the chest at (40.5, -83.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. The inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) is waiting for source items, indicating that the chest at (42.5, -83.5) may need to be refilled more frequently or with a larger quantity of coal.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - A dictionary representing the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
