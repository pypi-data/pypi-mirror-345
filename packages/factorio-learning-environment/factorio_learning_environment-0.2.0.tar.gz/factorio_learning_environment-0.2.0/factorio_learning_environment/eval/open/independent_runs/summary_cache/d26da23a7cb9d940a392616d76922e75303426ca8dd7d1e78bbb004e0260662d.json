{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to extract iron ore and process it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Too Far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid this error.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities in Occupied Spaces\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Fueling Issues\n- Regularly check and align inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure inserters are refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the setup and alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for any blockages or misalignments in the inserter path.\n\n### Chest Capacity and Inventory Management\n- Monitor the chest's capacity to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining process. Regularly extract items from the chest to free up space and maintain efficient operations."}
