Align fluid_system references with the final network configuration.\n- Consistent Fluid_System Assignment:\n  - Ensure that all components of the pipeline network\u2014including the boiler, offshore pump, and all pipe groups\u2014share a uniform and updated fluid_system identifier. The final network now employs identifiers in the 8453x range.\n- Search Radius Verification:\n  - Verify that the search radius for detecting candidate pipe groups is sufficiently broad to include all nearby entities, thereby preventing aborted connection attempts.\n- Inventory Attribute Consistency:\n  - Use supported inventory parameters when querying or modifying inventory items to avoid attribute-related errors."}
