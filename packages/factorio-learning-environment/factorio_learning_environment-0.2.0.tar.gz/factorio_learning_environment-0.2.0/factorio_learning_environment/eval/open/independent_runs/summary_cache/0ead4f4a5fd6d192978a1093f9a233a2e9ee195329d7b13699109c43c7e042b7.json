{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid, while the boiler is out of fuel.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities:\n- PipeGroup 1 (fluid_system=34767) at position (-18.5, 16.5) is currently empty.\n- PipeGroup 2 (fluid_system=34770) at position (-12.5, 21.5) is full of water.\n- PipeGroup 3 (fluid_system=34773) at position (-9.5, 21.5) is currently empty.\n- PipeGroup 4 (fluid_system=34778) at position (-10.5, 22.5) is currently empty.\n- PipeGroup 5 (fluid_system=34779) at position (-6.5, 23.5) is currently empty.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) that is currently without power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the pipes you are trying to connect are valid and within range. Check for any obstructions or incorrect placements that may prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities that may block the placement."}
