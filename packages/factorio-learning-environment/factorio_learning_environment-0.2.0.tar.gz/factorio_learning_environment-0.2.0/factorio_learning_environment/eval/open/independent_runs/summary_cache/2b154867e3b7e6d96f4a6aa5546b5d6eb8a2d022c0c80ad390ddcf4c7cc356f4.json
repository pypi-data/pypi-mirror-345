{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at Position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -86.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -84.5)\n- Burner mining drill (position 43.0, -86.0) with a drop position at (43.5, -84.5)\n- Wooden chest (position 43.5, -84.5) for coal storage\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at Position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -17.0, -52.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -50.5)\n- Wooden chest (position -16.5, -50.5) for iron ore storage\n\n#### Smelting Facility at Position (43.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 43.0, -79.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest (position 43.5, -76.5) for storage\n\n#### Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -51.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone furnace (position -13.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest (position -13.5, -51.5) for storage\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to get a non-existent entity\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. For example, the agent repeatedly tried to get a transport belt at (41.5, -84.5), but no such entity exists.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Check the inventory capacity of the target entity before inserting items. For example, the agent attempted to insert coal into a furnace that was already full.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from an empty chest\n- Verify that the chest contains the desired item before attempting to extract it. For example, the agent tried to extract iron ore from a chest that had no iron ore.\n\n#### Errors due to blocked output in mining drills\n- Ensure that the output of mining drills is not blocked. For example, a mining drill at (41.0, -86.0) has its output blocked by an item on the ground.\n\n#### Errors due to full chests at drop positions\n- Empty chests at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue operating. For example, chests at (43.5, -84.5) and (-16.5, -50.5) are full, causing mining drills to stop.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `get_entity(Prototype, Position)`: Retrieves an entity of a specific type at a given position. Fails if no such entity exists.\n- `insert_item(Prototype, Entity, quantity)`: Inserts a specified quantity of an item into an entity. Fails if the entity's inventory is full.\n- `extract_item(Prototype, Entity, quantity)`: Extracts a specified quantity of an item from an entity. Fails if the entity does not contain the item or the quantity is zero.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `blocked_belt`: Attempted to store a transport belt entity, but the entity did not exist.\n- `furnace`: Used to reference a furnace entity for inserting coal.\n- `full_chest`: Used to reference a chest entity for extracting iron ore."}
