{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal but output blocked due to no sink entity receiving output items\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, currently out of fuel and not smelting\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace, out of fuel and waiting for source items\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine, out of fuel and waiting for space in destination\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine, out of fuel and waiting for source items\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, not receiving electricity and has zero energy\n- Small electric poles at positions (21.5, 75.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (18.5, 72.5) forming a power network intended to supply the assembler and inserters, but assembler remains unpowered\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, the production line is currently halted due to fuel shortages in burner entities and lack of power to the assembling machine.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power despite power pole connections\n- Verify that electric poles are correctly connected into a single power network and that the network has available power.\n- Confirm that the assembler is within the electric pole supply radius and that no obstructions or misplacements prevent power delivery.\n- Check that power poles have sufficient energy and are properly linked to all inserters and the assembler.\n- Use electric mining drills and electric inserters if possible to simplify power management and avoid fuel dependency.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner entities due to empty inventory\n- Always ensure that coal is available in the player inventory before attempting to insert into burner mining drills, furnaces, or burner inserters.\n- If coal runs out, move to and harvest coal resources to replenish inventory.\n- Avoid repeated insertion attempts when inventory is empty to prevent exceptions and wasted actions.\n\n### Errors caused by burner inserters and furnaces running out of fuel\n- Regularly monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills, furnaces, and burner inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n- Insert coal promptly into these entities to avoid production stoppages.\n- Consider upgrading to electric inserters and electric furnaces to eliminate fuel management complexity.\n\n### Errors from output blockage and no sink entity for burner mining drill output\n- Ensure that the output of the burner mining drill is connected to a valid sink entity (e.g., inserter or chest) to prevent output blockage.\n- Check inserter positions and drop points to confirm items can be moved away from the mining drill output.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items into entities without sufficient inventory\n- Before inserting items, verify that the player inventory contains the required quantity.\n- Implement checks or conditional logic to avoid insertion attempts when inventory is empty.\n\n### General tips to mitigate placement and power errors (from previous report)\n- Confirm target tiles are free before placing entities.\n- Confirm inventory contains required entity types before placement.\n- Follow correct connection hierarchies: inserters between furnaces and belts.\n- Regularly verify power network connectivity and energy levels.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
