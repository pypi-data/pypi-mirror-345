{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with coal fuel, currently working, but output is blocked by an item on the ground. It has a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5) and is mining iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt. It is connected to the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and valid for placing entities like Stone Furnace, Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, and Transport Belt before attempting to place them. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot place [entity] at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the destination position is valid and unoccupied before moving entities like Stone Furnace. This will avoid errors like \"Cannot move Stone Furnace to the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the required entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.5 y=-53.0.\"\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources in inventory\n- Ensure that the required resources, such as coal, are available in the inventory before attempting operations that require them. This will avoid errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Address any warnings regarding blocked outputs by ensuring that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like the Burner Mining Drill. This will prevent the drill from being unable to output mined resources."}
