{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 19.5) - Operational with water flow\n- **Boiler** at (18.0, 22.5) - Still missing fuel (coal)\n- **Steam engine** at (22.5, 22.5) - Remains disconnected from power network\n- **New offshore pump** at (-11.0, 0.0) - Recently placed but not connected\n\n### Oil Production Complex\n- **Oil refinery** at (27.5, 40.5) - Still powered but showing NO_POWER status\n- **Broken pipe network** - Disconnected segments between (24.5,40.5) and refinery remain\n\n### Chemical Production Area\n- **Chemical plant** at (37.5, 22.5) - Configured for sulfur but still missing power\n- **Storage tank** at (32.5, 22.5) - Connected but empty\n- **Output chest** at (40.5, 22.5) - Still unused\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical Fluid System Failures (Updated)\n- **Self-connection attempts** - Multiple attempts to connect offshore pump to itself (-9.5,19.5)\n- **Obstacle detection** - Failed to detect 8 consecutive obstacles in x-axis during pipe placement\n- **Inventory management** - Attempted boiler placement without checking inventory (Step 92)\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues\n- **Position validation** - Still attempting placements without verifying clear path (Steps 93-95)\n- **Index errors** - Accessing empty pipe position lists (Step 94)\n- **Connection validation** - Not checking if target can receive fluid before connecting\n\n### New System Design Flaws\n- **Position calculation** - Boiler placement position derived from empty pipe list (Step 94)\n- **Pathfinding** - No fallback mechanism when primary path is blocked\n- **Entity verification** - Still not confirming entity existence before operations\n\n### Power System Issues\n- **Network isolation** - Steam engine remains disconnected despite nearby poles\n- **Voltage monitoring** - Still not implemented (current network voltage at 0)\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `connect_fluid_system()` - Needs obstacle detection enhancement\n- `verify_power_connection()` - Still missing voltage checks\n- `find_clear_path()` - New function needed based on obstacle patterns\n\n### Variables\n- `water_pos` - Now at (-11.0, 0.0) but unused\n- `pipe_positions` - Causing index errors when empty\n- `boiler_pos` - Calculation method needs revision\n- `obstacle_positions` - New variable tracking detected obstacles"}
