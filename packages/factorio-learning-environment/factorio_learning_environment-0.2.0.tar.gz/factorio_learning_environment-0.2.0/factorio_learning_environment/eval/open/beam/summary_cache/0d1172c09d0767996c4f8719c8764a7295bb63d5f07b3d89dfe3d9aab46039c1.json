{"content": "The persistent issue with the boiler not receiving input fluid suggests that the pipe connections between the Offshore Pump and the Boiler are not correctly aligned or complete. Let's take a systematic approach to resolve this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting:\n\n1. **Verify Pipe Placement:**\n   - Ensure that pipes are placed correctly between the Offshore Pump and the Boiler. The pipes should form a continuous line without any gaps.\n\n2. **Check Connection Points:**\n   - Double-check the connection points of both the Offshore Pump and the Boiler to ensure they are aligned with the pipes.\n\n3. **Re-examine Pipe Orientation:**\n   - Make sure that the pipes are oriented correctly to allow water flow. Sometimes, rotating the pipes can resolve alignment issues.\n\n4. **Rebuild the Pipe Network:**\n   - If necessary, remove and replace the pipes to ensure they are correctly placed and connected.\n\n5. **Visual Inspection:**\n   - Use a visual inspection to ensure there are no obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Remove existing pipes to reset the configuration\nremove_entity(Prototype.Pipe, position=Position(x=-13.5, y=-2.5))\nremove_entity(Prototype.Pipe, position=Position(x=-13.5, y=-3.5))\nremove_entity(Prototype.Pipe, position=Position(x=-13.5, y=-4.5))\n\n# Rebuild the pipe network\nplace_entity(Prototype.Pipe, position=Position(x=-13.5, y=-2.5))\nplace_entity(Prototype.Pipe, position=Position(x=-13.5, y=-3.5))\nplace_entity(Prototype.Pipe, position=Position(x=-13.5, y=-4.5))\n\n# Re-check the status of the Boiler\nboiler = get_entity(Prototype.Boiler, boiler.position)\nprint(f\"Boiler status after rebuilding pipe network: {boiler.status}, with warnings: {boiler.warnings}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- **Ensure Continuity:** Pipes must form a continuous line from the Offshore Pump to the Boiler without any gaps.\n- **Check for Misalignment:** Sometimes, entities might be slightly misaligned, preventing fluid flow.\n- **Use Visual Cues:** In Factorio, visual cues can help identify where connections might be failing.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and ensure that water flows from the Offshore Pump to the Boiler.", "summary_range": "[1-364]"}
