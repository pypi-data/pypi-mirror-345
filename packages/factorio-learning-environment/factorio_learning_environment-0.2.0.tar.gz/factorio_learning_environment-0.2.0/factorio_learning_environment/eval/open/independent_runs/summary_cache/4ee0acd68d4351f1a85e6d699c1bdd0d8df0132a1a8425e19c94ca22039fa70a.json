{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a transport belt system for copper ore extraction.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to a Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore extraction and storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items from the furnace to the chest.\n\n### Belt Systems\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-26.5, -65.5) to (-22.5, -65.5) for transporting materials.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-23.5, -64.5) to (-21.5, -64.5) for transporting materials.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-20.5, -64.5) to (-20.5, -66.5) for transporting materials.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5) for transporting materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters\n- Ensure there is a suitable and unoccupied position before attempting to place an inserter. Check for existing objects that might obstruct placement.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement."}
