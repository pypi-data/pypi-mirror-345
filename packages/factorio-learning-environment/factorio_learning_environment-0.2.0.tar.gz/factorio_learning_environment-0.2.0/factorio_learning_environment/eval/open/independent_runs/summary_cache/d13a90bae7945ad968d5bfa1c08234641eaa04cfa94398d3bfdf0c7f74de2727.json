{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (17.0, 72.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (17.0, 72.0) and a Stone Furnace at position (17.0, 74.0)\nAssociated entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (17.5, 76.5) that extracts iron plates from the Stone Furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (17.5, 75.5) that accepts output from the Burner Inserter\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 74.5) that accepts output from the Burner Mining Drill\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (20.0, 73.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, 73.0) and a Stone Furnace at position (20.0, 75.0)\nAssociated entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (20.5, 76.5) that accepts output from the Burner Mining Drill\n- Wooden Chest at position (21.5, 75.5) that accepts output from the Burner Mining Drill\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 74.5) that is connected to the Burner Mining Drill\n\n### Copper Plate Smelter\nConsists of a Stone Furnace at position (17.0, 74.0) that is used to smelt copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Chemical Plant at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of a Chemical Plant at position (0.5, 0.5) that is used to produce plastic bars.\nAssociated entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 10.5) that provides power to the Chemical Plant\n\n### Oil Refinery at position (20.5, 20.5)\nConsists of an Oil Refinery at position (20.5, 20.5) that is used to produce petroleum gas.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when crafting items:\n  - Failed to craft inserter/electronic-circuit/copper-cable/productivity-module because couldn't craft a required sub-ingredient. \n  - Ensure that you have the required sub-ingredients in your inventory or can craft them.\n* Errors when inserting items into a furnace:\n  - Could not insert copper-ore into stone-furnace because it already contains iron-ore or is full. \n  - Ensure that the furnace is empty or contains the same type of ore before attempting to insert items.\n* Errors when furnaces are full:\n  - Furnace at x=20.0 y=75.0 status: EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT. \n  - Ensure that you have a sink entity in place to accept the output from the furnace.\n* Errors when mining drills run out of fuel:\n  - Mining drill at x=17.0 y=72.0 status: EntityStatus.NO_FUEL. \n  - Ensure that you fuel the mining drills regularly to avoid downtime.\n* Errors when placing entities at a location that is occupied or unplaceable:\n  - Could not place entity at the target location - something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable. \n  - Ensure that the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when attempting to get an entity that does not exist at a specified position:\n  - Could not get Prototype.WoodenChest at position x=18.0 y=74.0. \n  - Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n* Errors when output is blocked:\n  - Mining drill at x=17.0 y=72.0 has warnings: ['output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.']. \n  - Ensure that you have a sink entity in place to accept the output from the mining drill.\n* Errors when connecting entities:\n  - Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a Prototype.StoneFurnace object as a source. \n  - Add an inserter that takes items from Prototype.StoneFurnace and use the inserter as a source entity.\n* Errors when extracting items from a furnace:\n  - Could not extract copper-plate from stone-furnace at (17.0, 74.0): Could not find a valid stone-furnace entity containing copper-plate. \n  - Ensure that the furnace contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n* Errors when crafting modules:\n  - 'Prototype' has no attribute 'SpeedModule'. \n  - Ensure that you are using the correct prototype name for the module you are trying to craft.\n* Errors when connecting power to entities:\n  - Could not get Prototype.SteamEngine at position x=10.0 y=10.0. \n  - Ensure that the steam engine exists at the specified"}
