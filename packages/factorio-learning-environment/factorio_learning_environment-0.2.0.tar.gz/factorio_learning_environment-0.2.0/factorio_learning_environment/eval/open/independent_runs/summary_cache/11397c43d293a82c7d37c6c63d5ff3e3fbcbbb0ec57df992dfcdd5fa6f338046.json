{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (45 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Cannot Place Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, and Transport Belt**: Ensure that the target location for placing these entities is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Check for any obstructions or existing entities at the desired location before attempting to place new entities.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- **Could Not Get Prototype.StoneFurnace at Position**: Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it.\n\n### Output Blockage and Ingredient Issues\n- **Output Blocked by Item on the Ground**: Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill. Clear any items blocking the output path.\n- **No Ingredients to Smelt**: Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. Check the furnace source inventory and supply the required materials for smelting."}
