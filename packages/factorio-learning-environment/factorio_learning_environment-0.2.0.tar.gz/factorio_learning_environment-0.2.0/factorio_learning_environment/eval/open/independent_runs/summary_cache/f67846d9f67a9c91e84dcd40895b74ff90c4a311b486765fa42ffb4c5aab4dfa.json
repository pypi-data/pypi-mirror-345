{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0) to (-11.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, actively smelting iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled by coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing mined iron ore, currently has 5 iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5) storing iron plates, some of which are full.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a drill without having coal in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Warnings about full storage\n- Regularly check and clear out storage chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage warnings.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item exists in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drill`: Represents a mining drill entity, used in operations involving mining and resource extraction.\n- `coal_to_insert`: Integer representing the quantity of coal intended for insertion into a drill or furnace. Ensure this variable is set correctly based on inventory checks."}
