{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with an inventory containing:\n  - Copper ore: 5\n  - Copper plate: 16\n  - Fuel: 2 coal\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing:\n  - Copper plate: 116\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to undefined variables:**\n  - Ensure that all variables, such as `wooden_chest`, are defined before use. This prevents `NameError` when trying to insert items into undefined entities.\n\n- **Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory:**\n  - Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to transfer them to another entity. This prevents exceptions related to insufficient items.\n\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients:**\n  - Ensure that you have the necessary ingredients available in the correct entity (like a furnace) to craft items. If an item cannot be crafted, check if the required sub-ingredients are present.\n\n- **Errors when trying to craft items without a crafting machine:**\n  - Ensure that you are using a crafting machine or furnace to craft items that require them. This prevents exceptions related to crafting failures.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Defined Functions:**\n  - `insert_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, wooden_chest, quantity=copper_plate_to_transfer)`: \n    - Failure: Occurred due to `wooden_chest` being undefined.\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`:\n    - Failure: Occurred due to missing required ingredients (copper-plate).\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wooden_chest`: Undefined (expected to be a Chest entity).\n  - `copper_plate_to_transfer`: Quantity of copper plates to transfer (type: int).\n  - `current_inventory`: Current inventory of the agent (type: dict)."}
