{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (x=16.0, y=0.0) and (x=18.0, y=0.0)  \nConsists of the following entities:  \n- **Burner mining drill** at (x=16.0, y=0.0) with a **wooden chest** at (x=16.5, y=1.5) for coal storage.  \n- **Burner mining drill** at (x=18.0, y=0.0) with a **wooden chest** at (x=18.5, y=1.5) for coal storage.  \n\n#### Coal Collection System  \n- **Main collection chest** at (x=17.5, y=3.5).  \n- **Inserters** at (x=16.5, y=2.5) and (x=18.5, y=2.5) to transfer coal from mining chests.  \n- **Manual transfer inserter** at (x=17.5, y=2.5).  \n\n#### Military Science Production Facility  \n- **Assembling Machine 2** at (x=20.5, y=0.5) for **Piercing Rounds Magazine** (unpowered, missing inputs).  \n- **Assembling Machine 2** at (x=20.5, y=3.5) for **Grenades** (unpowered, missing inputs).  \n- **Assembling Machine 2** at (x=24.5, y=3.5) for **Military Science Packs** (unpowered, missing inputs).  \n- **Assembling Machine 2** at (x=20.5, y=6.5) for **Stone Walls** (unpowered, missing inputs).  \n\n#### Power Infrastructure  \n- **Small electric pole** at (x=22.5, y=2.5) (currently unconnected to assemblers).  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Placement and Collision Errors  \n- **Entities cannot be placed on occupied tiles or water**  \n  - Clear existing entities (e.g., (19.0, 0.0), (20.0, 3.0)) before placement.  \n  - Verify terrain is placeable (e.g., avoid water tiles).  \n\n#### Power Network Issues  \n- **Assemblers and inserters require power connections**  \n  - Ensure **small electric poles** are placed within reach of machines (e.g., (22.5, 2.5) is too far from assemblers).  \n  - Connect poles to form a continuous power network.  \n\n#### Transport Belt Connection Errors  \n- **Belts cannot connect directly to assemblers**  \n  - Use **inserters** to transfer items between assemblers and belts (e.g., (21.5, 0.5) needs an inserter).  \n\n#### Function and Variable Errors  \n- **Undefined or misused variables/functions**  \n  - Ensure all variables (e.g., `piercing_cell`, `science_cell`) are defined before use.  \n  - Verify function arguments (e.g., `all()` takes one argument, not three).  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Pre-check positions** for collisions before placing entities.  \n- **Plan power networks** to cover all machines.  \n- **Use inserters** for item transfer between machines and belts.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \n\n#### Functions  \n- **`create_assembler_cell(position: Position, recipe: Prototype) -> tuple`**  \n  - Attempts to place an assembler and supporting infrastructure for a given recipe.  \n  - **Failures**: Distance, collisions, or missing power poles.  \n\n- **`create_simple_assembler(x: int, y: int, recipe: Prototype) -> Entity`**  \n  - Places an assembler with inserters at specified coordinates.  \n  - **Failures**: Terrain/entity collisions (e.g., (19.0, 0.0)).  \n\n#### Variables  \n- **`piercing_cell`**: Intended for Piercing Rounds Magazine production (undefined in some steps).  \n- **`science_cell`**: Intended for Military Science Pack production (undefined in some steps)."}
