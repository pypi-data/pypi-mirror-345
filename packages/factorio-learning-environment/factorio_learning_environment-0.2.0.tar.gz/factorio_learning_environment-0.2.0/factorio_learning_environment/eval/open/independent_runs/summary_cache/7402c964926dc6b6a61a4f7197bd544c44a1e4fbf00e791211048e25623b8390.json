{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no existing structures on the map. The logs indicate that no entities have been successfully placed or constructed during the steps executed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities in non-buildable areas\n- Ensure that the area is buildable before attempting to place entities such as Stone Furnaces or Wooden Chests. Check for obstacles or terrain restrictions that might prevent placement.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied or restricted\n- Verify that the target tile is free and suitable for the intended entity before placing. This includes ensuring that the tile is not occupied by another entity or restricted by game mechanics.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for entity operation\n- Before placing entities that require resources (e.g., Stone Furnaces needing coal), ensure that you have the necessary resources available and that the entity is correctly placed to receive those resources.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the placement command is executed within the bounds of the map and in accordance with the game's placement rules."}
