{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine with positions [(x=-3.5,y=26.5),(x=-2.5,y=26.5),(x=-1.5,y=26.5),(x=-1.5,y=27.5),(x=-1.5,y=28.5)]\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n- BeltGroup with belts at positions [(x=50.5, y=-86.5) -> (x=48.5, y=-86.5)], [(x=49.5, y=-86.5) -> (x=47.5, y=-86.5)], [(x=43.5, y=-84.5) -> (x=45.5, y=-84.5)], [(x=45.5, y=-85.5) -> (x=47.5, y=-85.5)], [(x=52.5, y=-83.5) -> (x=52.5, y=-85.5)]\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at position (x=5.5, y=5.5) connected to the power network\n\n### Power Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions [(x=7.5,y=17.5),(x=9.5,y=23.5),(x=7.5,y=13.5),...,(x=16.5,y=31.5),(x=12.5,y=34.5),(x=7.5,y=9.5)], voltage=0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between the boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0) and the steam engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5) are correctly aligned and connected. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes that may prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
