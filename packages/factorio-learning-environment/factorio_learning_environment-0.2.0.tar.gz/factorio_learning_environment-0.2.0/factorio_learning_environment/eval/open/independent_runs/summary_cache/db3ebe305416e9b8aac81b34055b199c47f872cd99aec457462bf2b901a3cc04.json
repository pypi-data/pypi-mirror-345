{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-12.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-11.5, y=-47.5), storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting placement. If a tile is occupied, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or altering the reference position.\n\n### Misalignment errors between inserters and target entities\n- Verify the alignment of inserters with their respective pickup and drop positions. Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities without obstruction.\n\n### Inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity is producing or has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check that the production chain is not blocked or stalled."}
