{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 1 at position (8.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear inserter at position (8.5, 11.5) facing right\n- Iron gear chest at position (9.5, 10.5) containing 10 iron gears\n- Copper inserter at position (6.5, 13.5)\n- Copper chest at position (11.5, 13.5) containing 1 copper plate\n- Output inserter at position (10.5, 13.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-4.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting power to machines\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining/smelting setups at various locations:\n1. Setup at x=41, y=-82:\n- Burner mining drill\n- Wooden chest (252 coal)\n- Burner inserter\n\n2. Setup at x=-28, y=-61:\n- Burner mining drill\n- Wooden chest\n- Burner inserter\n- Stone furnace\n- Output chest (2 iron plates)\n\n3. Setup at x=-18, y=-53:\n- Burner mining drill\n- Wooden chest\n- Burner inserter\n- Stone furnace\n- Output chest (44 iron plates)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities near occupied tiles\n- Check for existing entities (chests, belts, poles etc.) before placing new entities\n- Adjust spacing parameter when using place_entity_next_to() if default spacing causes conflicts\n- Consider using different directions or reference positions if default placement is blocked\n\n### Errors with furnace operations\n- Verify furnace has required ingredients before attempting to extract items\n- Check if furnace actually contains the item type you're trying to extract\n\n### Entity placement coordination errors\n- Plan the layout considering the space requirements of all components\n- Account for entity dimensions when placing larger machines (assemblers, boilers etc.)\n- Consider the direction and spacing of inserters relative to the machines they service\n\n### Resource availability errors\n- Ensure machines have all required ingredients before expecting output\n- Keep input chests stocked with required materials\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner-type entities"}
