{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing wooden chests in non-buildable areas\n- Ensure the target position is buildable before attempting to place a wooden chest. Use the `is_buildable` API to check the tile status.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to get entities that do not exist\n- Verify the existence of an entity at the specified position before calling `get_entity`. Use the `is_entity_present` API to confirm the entity's presence.\n\n#### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has a valid source of items to transfer. Check the inserter's source entity and ensure it contains items.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the tile is not already occupied by another entity. Use the `is_tile_occupied` API to verify tile availability.\n\n#### Errors with coal drill optimization\n- Ensure the coal drill has sufficient fuel and is connected to a storage entity (e.g., a chest) to optimize its output. Regularly check the drill's fuel level and storage capacity."}
