{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nThis structure is responsible for generating electricity, consisting of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5): Currently working.\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0): Initially had no fuel but is now working after coal was inserted.\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5): Initially not connected but is now working.\n- Pipe Group connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and Steam Engine, with segments at positions (-9.5, 23.5) and (-4.5, 16.5).\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\n- Small Electric Pole at position (-0.5, 19.5): Placed but the electricity group at position (-5.4, 20.0) is not plugged into the electric network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Re-evaluate the pipe alignment if connections fail.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Always check that the boiler has the necessary fuel to operate. Insert coal or other fuel types as required.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to place an entity, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory. For example, ensure you have small electric poles before trying to place them.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network Connections\n- Verify that all components of the electricity network are properly connected. Ensure that electric poles are connected to the network and that the electricity group is plugged in.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients\n- Ensure that all production entities, like stone furnaces, have the necessary ingredients to function."}
