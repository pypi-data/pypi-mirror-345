Monitor the fuel status to avoid interruptions in operation.\n- **Errors when the burner mining drill cannot drop resources**: The chest at the drop position must be emptied to allow the burner mining drill to continue mining. Regularly check the inventory of the wooden chest and remove excess coal to prevent blockage.\n- **Errors when the furnace has no ingredients**: Ensure that there are ingredients available for smelting in the stone furnace. Check the inventory and supply chain to maintain a steady flow of materials.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Type-annotated utility functions**: None defined yet.\n- **Important variables assigned**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `burner mining drill status`: EntityStatus\n  - `wooden chest inventory`: dict"}
