{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the entities, starting at Position (20.5, -10.5) with steam and Position (19.5, -2.5) with water\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for power distribution\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (19.5, 18.5) for copper ore collection\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for iron ore collection\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) with a recipe for copper cable\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) for item movement\n- Wooden Chest at Position (8.5, 0.5) for storage\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Verify that the connection points are not obstructed and that the correct type of pipe is used.\n\n### AttributeError in PipeGroup\n- When accessing attributes of a PipeGroup, ensure that you are using the correct attribute names. The 'direction' attribute does not exist for PipeGroup; verify the available attributes before accessing them.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to the required source items. Check the pickup position and ensure it is correctly aligned with the source entity containing the items.\n\n### Assembling Machine Missing Resources\n- Make sure that the assembling machine has all the necessary ingredients, such as copper plates, to produce the desired products. Check the supply chain leading to the machine and ensure it is uninterrupted."}
