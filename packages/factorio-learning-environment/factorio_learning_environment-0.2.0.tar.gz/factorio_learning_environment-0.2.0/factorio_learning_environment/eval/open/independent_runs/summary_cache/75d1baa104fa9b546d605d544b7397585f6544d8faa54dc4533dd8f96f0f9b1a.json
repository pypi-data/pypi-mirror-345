This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to allow continuous mining and prevent stoppages in resource extraction.\n\n### Warnings about furnaces with no ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly supply them with the required ores to maintain production efficiency."}
