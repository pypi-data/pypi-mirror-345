Always ensure the belt is connected to an appropriate inserter (or similar intermediary) rather than directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine object.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Issues  \n\u2002\u2013 Wooden chests could not be placed when the target position was too far (distance exceeding the allowed maximum). Move closer to the target position before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortages  \n\u2002\u2013 Attempts to place a wooden chest sometimes failed due to the chest not being available in the inventory. Confirm the inventory has the required item prior to placement.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Errors  \n\u2002\u2013 A NameError occurred because the variable \u2018target_chest\u2019 was not defined. Verify that all variable names are correctly declared and consistently referenced."}
