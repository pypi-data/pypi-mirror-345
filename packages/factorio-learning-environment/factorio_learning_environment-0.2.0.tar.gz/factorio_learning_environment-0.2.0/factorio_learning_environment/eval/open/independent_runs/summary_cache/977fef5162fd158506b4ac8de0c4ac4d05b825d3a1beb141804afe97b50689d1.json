{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently out of fuel and has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing 361 iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently out of fuel and has warnings indicating that the furnace source is full and the furnace result is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing 661 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient fuel\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory to refuel the Burner Mining Drill before attempting to operate it.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Check if the furnace has space for the items you are trying to insert. If the furnace is full or out of fuel, you will not be able to insert items.\n\n### Errors when the chest is full\n- Monitor the inventory of the chests to avoid attempting to drop items into a full chest. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The same errors regarding insufficient coal and item insertion into the furnace have occurred multiple times. Addressing the fuel issue and checking the furnace's status before attempting to insert items will help mitigate these errors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: dict[str, int] - Current inventory of the agent, containing {'wood': 4, 'iron-ore': 37}."}
