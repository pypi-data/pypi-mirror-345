{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5). It is currently working but has a warning: \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt.\" It has an inventory of 60 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target tile is free and valid before attempting to place entities like Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, Transport Belt, and Stone Furnace. Multiple attempts to place these entities failed due to occupied or invalid locations.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- Verify the target location is valid and free before attempting to move entities like Stone Furnace. Several attempts to move resulted in errors due to invalid target locations.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Errors occurred when trying to get a Stone Furnace at a position where it was not present.\n\n### Output blockage in production facilities\n- Ensure that the output from entities like Burner Mining Drills is not blocked. The drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) has a warning indicating its output is blocked by an item on the ground. Ensure a sink entity is in place to accept the output.\n\n### Ingredient shortages in production facilities\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. The Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) has a warning indicating a lack of ingredients to smelt. Ensure a steady supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency."}
