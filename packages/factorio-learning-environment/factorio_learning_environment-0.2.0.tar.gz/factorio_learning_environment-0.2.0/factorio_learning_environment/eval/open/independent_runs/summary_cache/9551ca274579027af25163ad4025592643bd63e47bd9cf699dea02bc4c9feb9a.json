{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Currently misaligned, causing transfer issues.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. The current misalignment results in the inserter not picking up iron ore from the chest.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position to ensure iron ore is transferred correctly for smelting.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Refueling\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel an inserter. Lack of coal can prevent the inserter from operating.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of the inserter to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment or lack of fuel in the inserter can cause the furnace to not receive the necessary ingredients for smelting."}
