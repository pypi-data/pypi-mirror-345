{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Currently operational (299,960 crude oil remaining)\n- **Main Storage tank** at (21.5,41.5) - Stores crude oil (currently holding 38.98 crude oil)\n- **Remote Storage tank** at (15.5,35.5) - Additional storage (currently holding 8.12 crude oil)\n- Connected by underground PipeGroup (fluid_system=2860) for crude oil transport\n\n### Power Generation System at (26.5,42.0)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Provides water (currently operational)\n- **Boiler** at (26.5,42.0) - Fuel level 28/50 coal\n- **Steam engine** at (29.5,42.5) - Running at 100% capacity (13,500 power)\n- Connected by:\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=2853) for water transport\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=2865) for steam transport\n- Powered by electricity group (id=1334) with 6 small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power system expansion failures\n- Attempted to place boiler at (26.5,47.0) while player was at (0,0)\n- Solution:\n  - Move within 10 tiles of target position before placing entities\n  - Implement position verification before placement attempts\n\n### Fuel management improvements\n- Current fuel buffer (200 coal) working effectively\n- Maintain current protocols:\n  - Minimum threshold: 30 coal\n  - Emergency buffer: 100 coal\n  - Automated refueling\n\n### System redundancy requirements\n- Single power generation system remains vulnerable\n- Solutions:\n  - Complete secondary power system installation\n  - Implement automatic failover switching\n  - Maintain separate fuel supplies\n\n### Network optimization\n- All fluid networks operating at optimal levels:\n  - Water (ID 2853): 179.15/min\n  - Crude oil (ID 2860): 838.66/min  \n  - Steam (ID 2865): 180.50/min\n- Continue monitoring pressure and temperature\n\n### Maintenance procedures\n- Current automated systems working effectively\n- Recommended additions:\n  1. Expand power generation capacity\n  2. Implement secondary water supply\n  3. Upgrade to electric mining drills\n  4. Add performance analytics system\n\n### Emergency protocols\n- All previous recommendations remain valid:\n  1. Maintain fuel buffers\n  2. Document network connections\n  3. Implement automated alerts\n  4. Create isolation procedures\n\n### Placement verification\n- Always verify:\n  1. Player proximity to target\n  2. Tile availability\n  3. Connection requirements\n  4. Resource availability"}
