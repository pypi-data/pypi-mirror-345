{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Ensure Adequate Fuel Supply\n- **Not enough coal in inventory to refuel inserter or mining drill**: Always maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel entities that require it. Regularly check and refuel entities to prevent operation halts.\n\n### Correct Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- **Furnace not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues**: Verify that inserters are correctly positioned and aligned to pick up items from the source and drop them into the target. Ensure that the inserter has fuel and is operational.\n\n### Manage Inventory and Storage\n- **Chest at drop position is full**: Regularly check the storage capacity of chests and clear them to prevent mining operations from stopping. Ensure that there is enough space in the chest for continued operations.\n\n### Monitor Resource Levels\n- **Chest is empty or low on iron ore**: Keep track of resource levels in storage entities to ensure continuous production. Replenish resources as needed to maintain workflow efficiency."}
