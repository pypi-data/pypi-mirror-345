{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. The agent's attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces have been unsuccessful, resulting in no updated entities on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure there is a viable location for placing the Burner Mining Drill. If the current BuildingBox size is too large, consider decreasing its size or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to find a suitable placement spot.\n\n### Errors when placing Stone Furnace\n- Verify that the desired location for placing the Stone Furnace is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust the placement strategy if necessary to find an appropriate spot.\n\n### Errors related to movement\n- When moving to a position, ensure that the position values are correctly formatted as integers. Avoid using string indices for position values to prevent movement errors.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before attempting to place any entity, confirm that the target tile is not occupied by another entity and is suitable for the intended structure."}
