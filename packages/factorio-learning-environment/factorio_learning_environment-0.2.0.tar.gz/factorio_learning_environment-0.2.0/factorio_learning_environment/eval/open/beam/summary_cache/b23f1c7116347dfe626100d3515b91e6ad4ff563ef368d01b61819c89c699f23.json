{"content": "The inspection of the active furnace has provided further clarity on the situation:\n\n### Active Furnace Recipe Details:\n- **Recipe Name**: Stone Furnace\n- **Ingredients Required**: **5 pieces of stone**\n- **Output Products**: None currently defined; the recipe is not enabled for smelting.\n- **Enabled Status**: The recipe is marked as **False**, indicating that the furnace cannot process any materials, including Copper Ore.\n\n### Current Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace currently contains **18 Iron Plates** and no other materials, confirming that it is not engaged in any processing.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 4 pieces of stone remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** remaining.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is unable to smelt Copper Ore because it does not have the required **5 pieces of stone** to enable its recipe.\n- The Copper Ore is effectively idle in the inventory due to the furnace's inability to process it.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Stone from the Furnace**: Since the furnace is not processing, I will need to extract the stone that was previously loaded.\n2. **Reinsert Stone**: After extraction, I will load **5 pieces of stone** into the furnace to meet the recipe requirement.\n3. **Reinsert Copper Ore for Smelting**: Once the stone is loaded, I can then insert the Copper Ore to allow the furnace to initiate the smelting process.\n\nLet\u2019s first extract the stone from the active furnace to reset its state. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=4)  # Extract all 4 pieces of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-316]"}
