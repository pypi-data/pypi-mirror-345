{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity but is currently not operational due to connectivity issues. It consists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Additional Furnace\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Inserter and Chest System\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input of automation science packs but not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- Multiple Pipe Groups in various positions, all currently empty and not connected to any fluid systems.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity poles at various positions, currently not providing power due to connectivity issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Water Source Connection\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to a water source. Verify the placement of pipes and ensure they are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement and Removal\n- Double-check the positions before placing or removing pipes to ensure they are correctly placed and removed. Avoid attempting to interact with non-existent entities at specified positions.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Make sure all entities requiring electricity are connected to an operational power network. Check the connections between the steam engine, electric poles, and other entities to ensure they are correctly linked.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole to ensure they receive the necessary electricity to operate.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check the inventory and supply chain to keep them operational."}
