Although it was refueled in an earlier step, the final status now shows an empty fuel inventory with a warning \u201cout of fuel\u201d (status: NO_FUEL).\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) for water extraction.\n- Steam engine at position(2.5, 21.5) for electricity generation. It remains NOT_CONNECTED and displays warnings: \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d, \u201cno input liquid\u201d, and \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d.\n- Pipeline Network:\n\u2003\u2022 Step 128: Cleared stray pipes and reattempted connection using intermediate waypoints new_wp_start at (-7.0, 24.5) and new_wp_mid at (-2.0, 23.5); the first segment succeeded while subsequent segments failed.\n\u2003\u2022 Step 129: Reattempted an L-shaped connection with waypoints at (-7.0, 24.5) and (0.5, 22.0); only the later segment connected, with earlier segments failing.\n\u2003\u2022 Step 130: After refueling the boiler, an intermediate waypoint at (-2.5, 23.0) was used but the connection still failed.\n\u2003\u2022 Steps 131\u2013132: Multi-segment attempts with various intermediate waypoints (such as wp1, wp2, wpA, and wpB) all resulted in failed connections.\n\u2003\u2022 Step 133: A split-segment approach along a straight line was attempted using waypoints at (-7.5, 24.5), (-5.5, 23.9), (-3.5, 23.3), (-1.5, 22.7), (0.5, 22.1), and (2.5, 21.5); only one segment succeeded while others failed.\n\u2003\u2022 Steps 134\u2013135: Manual pipe insertion was attempted at a calculated midpoint (-3.75, 23.0). The initial try failed due to exceeding the maximum placement distance, and a repositioned retry failed because of obstruction conflicts.\n\u2003Overall, despite numerous adjustment attempts, the pipeline connectivity between the boiler\u2019s steam output and the steam engine remains unestablished.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Connection and Repositioning Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure both source and target connection points are clear, properly aligned, and within the allowed placement range before initiating connections.\n  \n\u2022 Fluid Mismatch and Contamination:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that pipeline segments contain only the required fluid by thoroughly clearing any extraneous or contaminated fluids.\n  \n\u2022 Multi-Segment Pipeline Construction Challenges:\n\u2003\u2013 Carefully adjust and validate intermediate waypoint positions so that each pipeline segment has compatible connection points and clear paths.\n  \n\u2022 Inventory and Resource Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-check inventory counts for essential items (e.g., coal for refueling and sufficient pipes) before performing operations that depend on them.\n  \n\u2022 General Placement and Stabilization:\n\u2003\u2013 Allow sufficient stabilization time after repositioning or clearing actions and ensure target areas are unobstructed to avoid cumulative connection failures.\n  \n\u2022 Manual Entity Placement Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the player\u2019s position is within the permissible range for manual placements.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the target tile is free of existing objects to prevent placement conflicts."}
