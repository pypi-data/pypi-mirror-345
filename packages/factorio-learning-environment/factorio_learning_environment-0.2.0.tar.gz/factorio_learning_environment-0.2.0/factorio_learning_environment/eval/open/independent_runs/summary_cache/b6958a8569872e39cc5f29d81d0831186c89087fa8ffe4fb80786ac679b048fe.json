{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nLocated at positions:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing mined iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\nThis structure is designed to extract iron ore from the ground, store it in a chest, and then transfer it to a furnace for smelting into iron plates. The inserter is responsible for moving iron ore from the chest to the furnace, but it is currently not functioning properly due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning properly.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly configured to pick up iron ore from the chest and drop it into the furnace. Verify the inserter's pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has a continuous supply of iron ore. Verify that the inserter is functioning and transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as the burner mining drill and burner inserter, are regularly refueled with coal to maintain continuous operation."}
