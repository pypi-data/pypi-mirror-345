{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and currently holding 56 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and currently holding 46 iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 1.5) with coal as fuel, positioned to transfer items from the furnace at (0.0, 0.0) to the furnace at (2.0, 0.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 1.5) with coal as fuel, positioned to transfer items from the furnace at (2.0, 0.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items\n- Ensure all required raw resources are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, wooden chests require wood, which must be gathered as it is not a craftable item.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is unoccupied. Adjust the spacing or direction if necessary to avoid conflicts with existing objects.\n\n### Errors in Using Undefined Variables\n- Ensure that all variables, such as `first_chest`, are properly defined and initialized before use. Double-check variable names for typos or incorrect references.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For instance, ensure that coal is available before attempting to insert it into an inserter.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- Confirm that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve or interact with it. If an entity is not found, recheck the position and ensure it is correct."}
