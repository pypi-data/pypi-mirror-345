{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (Around position x=1-3, y=1-3)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (1.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 2.5)\n- Two wooden chests at positions (1.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 3.5) storing iron plates\n- Additional burner inserter (5.5, 2.5) and wooden chest (5.5, 3.5) setup\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (Around position x=2-4, y=7-9)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (2.0, 7.0) and (4.0, 7.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (2.5, 8.5) and (4.5, 8.5)\n- Two wooden chests at positions (2.5, 9.5) and (4.5, 9.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Research Facility (Around position x=6-12, y=16-17)\nConsists of:\n- Two labs working on logistics research\n- Connected to power network\n\n### Power Generation System (Around position x=2-13, y=35)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (2.5, 35.5)\n- Boiler at position (7.0, 35.5)\n- Steam engine at position (13.5, 35.5)\n- Two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes connecting pump to boiler\n  - Steam pipes connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple power poles\n\n### Disconnected Structure\n- Unused offshore pump at position (-5.5, 26.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Boiler is not functioning due to lack of fuel - ensure coal is loaded into boilers to maintain power generation\n\n### Storage Management\n- Inserters are showing \"chest is full\" warnings - implement a system to manage full storage or add more storage capacity\n\n### Fluid System Setup\n- Disconnected offshore pump detected - ensure all fluid-related structures are properly connected to their intended systems\n- When placing fluid structures, ensure they form a complete connected system from source to destination"}
