Regularly check and replenish your inventory as needed.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests Blocking Operations\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to prevent blockage of mining drills and inserters. This will ensure continuous operation and prevent warnings related to full chests.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked. Regularly check and clear any blockages to maintain efficient operation of inserters."}
