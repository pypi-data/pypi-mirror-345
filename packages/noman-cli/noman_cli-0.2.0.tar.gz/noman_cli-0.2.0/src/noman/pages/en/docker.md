# docker command

Manage Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes.

## Overview

Docker is a platform that uses containerization to package applications and their dependencies into isolated units. The `docker` command provides a CLI to build, run, and manage containers, images, networks, and volumes. It allows developers to create consistent environments across different machines.

### Stopping a container

```console
$ docker stop webserver
webserver
```

### Removing a container

```console
$ docker rm webserver
webserver
```

## Tips

### Use Docker Compose for Multi-Container Applications

For applications with multiple services, use Docker Compose with a `docker-compose.yml` file instead of managing each container separately with `docker run` commands.

### Clean Up Unused Resources

Use `docker system prune` to remove all stopped containers, unused networks, dangling images, and build cache. Add the `-a` flag to also remove all unused images.

### Use Named Volumes for Persistent Data

Instead of using bind mounts, use named volumes for data that needs to persist between container restarts: `docker run -v mydata:/app/data myapp`.

### Use Multi-Stage Builds

For smaller production images, use multi-stage builds in your Dockerfile to separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q1. What's the difference between `docker run` and `docker start`?
A. `docker run` creates and starts a new container from an image, while `docker start` restarts a stopped container that already exists.

#### Q2. How do I access a running container's shell?
A. Use `docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash` or `/bin/sh` to get an interactive shell inside a running container.

#### Q3. How do I view container logs?
A. Use `docker logs container_name` to view the logs of a container. Add `-f` to follow the log output in real-time.

#### Q4. How do I copy files between my host and a container?
A. Use `docker cp /host/path container_name:/container/path` to copy from host to container, or `docker cp container_name:/container/path /host/path` to copy from container to host.

#### Q5. How do I update a running container's configuration?
A. You can't update most configuration options of a running container. Instead, stop the container, remove it, and create a new one with the updated configuration.
