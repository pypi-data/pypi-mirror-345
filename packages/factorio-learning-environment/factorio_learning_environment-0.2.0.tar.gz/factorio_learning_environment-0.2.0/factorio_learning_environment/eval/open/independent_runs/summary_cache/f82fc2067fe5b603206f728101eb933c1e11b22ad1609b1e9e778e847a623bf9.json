{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nLocated at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), this facility is responsible for mining and processing iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with fuel inventory of coal and status as working. It extracts iron ore and deposits it into adjacent chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storing mined iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) for transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces and moving iron plates to storage.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace at (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) is currently working, while the one at (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) is waiting for ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nThis area consists of multiple wooden chests for storing iron plates:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-49.5), (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-7.5, y=-48.5), (x=-5.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-4.5, y=-48.5) with varying quantities of iron plates.\n- **Empty Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-3.5, y=-48.5), (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) ready for future use.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Blockage Issues with Inserters\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked before attempting to drop items. Regularly check and clear blockages to maintain smooth operation.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnaces\n- Before attempting to extract items from a furnace, verify that the furnace contains the items you intend to extract. Adjust extraction quantities to match available inventory.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Position inserters correctly and ensure they have access to source items. Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure a continuous supply of ingredients to furnaces to prevent downtime. Regularly check and restock furnaces with necessary resources.\n\n### Refueling and Maintenance\n- Regularly refuel all burner entities to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as needed to avoid interruptions."}
