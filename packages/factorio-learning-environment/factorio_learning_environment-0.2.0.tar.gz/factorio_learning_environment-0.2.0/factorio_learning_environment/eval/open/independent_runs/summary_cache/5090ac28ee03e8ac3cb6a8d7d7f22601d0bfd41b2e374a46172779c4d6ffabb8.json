{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at position (43.0, -85.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (43.0, -85.0) mining coal (currently out of fuel)\n- Wooden chest at position (43.5, -83.5) collecting the mined coal (contains 14 coal)\n- Burner inserter at position (44.5, -83.5) rotated LEFT, taking items from position (45.5, -83.5) and dropping at the chest position (43.5, -83.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at position (56.0, -68.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (56.0, -68.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates (currently has no ingredients to smelt, but contains 1 iron plate in result inventory)\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing System at position (-5.0, -71.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-5.0, -71.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at position (-3.5, -71.5) collecting the mined iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position (-2.5, -71.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- Stone furnace at position (-1.0, -71.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates (currently has 1 iron ore in source and 3 iron plates in result)\n- Burner inserter at position (0.5, -70.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the output chest (currently out of fuel)\n- Wooden chest at position (1.5, -70.5) collecting the processed iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities with collision issues\n- When placing inserters next to other entities, ensure there's enough space and no collision with existing structures\n- Consider using different directions or increasing spacing when placing entities near each other\n- Check the entity's dimensions before placement to avoid overlap with existing structures\n- Try alternative positions when encountering placement errors, especially for inserters between entities\n\n### Errors when crafting items requiring smelting\n- Remember that raw resources like iron ore need to be smelted in a furnace before they can be used in crafting\n- Ensure you have enough processed materials (like iron plates) before attempting to craft items that require them\n\n### Errors when crafting items requiring raw resources\n- Some items require raw resources that cannot be crafted (like wood or stone) and must be gathered from the environment\n- Verify you have all required raw resources before attempting to craft items\n\n### Errors when inserting fuel into entities\n- Ensure you have the required fuel (like coal) in your inventory before attempting to insert it into machines\n- Remember to fuel all powered entities including mining drills, inserters, and furnaces\n\n### Errors when managing inventory\n- Check your inventory before placing entities to ensure you have the required items\n- Consider crafting necessary items before starting construction of complex systems"}
