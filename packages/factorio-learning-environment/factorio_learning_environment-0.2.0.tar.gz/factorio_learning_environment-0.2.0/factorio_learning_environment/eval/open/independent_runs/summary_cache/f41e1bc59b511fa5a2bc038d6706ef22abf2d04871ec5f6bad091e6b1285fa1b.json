Verify the water source is accessible and not obstructed.\n\n### Boiler Not Connected to Water Source\n- Confirm that the boiler is properly connected to the offshore pump via pipes. Ensure all connections are complete and there are no gaps in the pipe network.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to the power network with small electric poles. Ensure all connections are established and there are no breaks in the network.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the electricity network to ensure the inserter is connected to a powered electric pole. Address any power supply issues in the network.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Supply the required raw materials to avoid idle furnaces."}
