{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is not occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can successfully transfer items between entities. Misalignment may cause items not to be transferred, leading to production halts.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as mining drills, furnaces, and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Lack of fuel can cause production delays.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure that chests and other storage entities have enough space to store incoming materials. Full chests can halt production processes."}
