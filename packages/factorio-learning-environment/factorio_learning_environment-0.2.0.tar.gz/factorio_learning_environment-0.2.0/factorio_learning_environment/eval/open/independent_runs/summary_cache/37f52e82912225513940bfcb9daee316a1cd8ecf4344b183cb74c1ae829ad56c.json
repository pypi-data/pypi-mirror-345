{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Three stone furnaces at positions:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input\n  - Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input\n  - Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with coal fuel, extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chests at positions:\n  - Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) storing iron ore\n  - Chest at position (x=5.5, y=-60.5) connected to the mining drill\n- Iron chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions:\n  - Chests at positions (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5) storing iron plates, with warnings indicating they are full\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a drill without having coal in the inventory results in an error.\n\n### Warnings about full storage chests\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. For instance, the chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the item is not present in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
