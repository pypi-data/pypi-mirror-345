{"content": "It seems that the attempts to locate resources have consistently failed, culminating in an error indicating that there are no resources of the specified type (stone) at the given location. This reinforces the conclusion that I am in an area devoid of any resources.\n\n### Summary of Attempts and Outcomes:\n1. **Initial Resource Search**: Attempts to find resources using specific coordinates yielded no results.\n2. **Movement Commands**: Multiple movement commands to different positions produced no output, indicating that the actions were ineffective.\n3. **Broad Resource Search**: Attempts to search for resources using a broader approach (checking multiple types) also resulted in errors, confirming the absence of resources.\n4. **Error Handling**: The error message indicated that there were no resources of the specified type at the given coordinates.\n\n### Tips and Logic Patterns to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Initial Resource Checks**: Always start by checking for resources in a wider area before attempting to move or build. Use a method that scans for all types of resources in a specified radius.\n2. **Movement Validation**: Ensure that movement commands are executed in areas known to have resources. If unsure, check for resource patches before moving.\n3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage situations where resources are not found. This can include fallback strategies or alerts to indicate the need for a different approach.\n4. **Resource Type Flexibility**: When searching for resources, consider using a generic search that does not specify a type initially, allowing for the discovery of any available resources.\n5. **Iterative Exploration**: If no resources are found, systematically explore different areas rather than relying on a single point. This can involve moving in a grid-like pattern to ensure thorough coverage.\n\nBy following these guidelines, future attempts to locate resources and build effectively can be more successful, reducing the likelihood of encountering barren areas without resources.", "summary_range": "[1-36]"}
