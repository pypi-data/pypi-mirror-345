{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch. It is currently fueled with coal and has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Used for storing extracted iron ore. Currently empty.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores iron ore and iron plates. Contains 8 iron ore and 4 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers items between the chests. Currently fueled with coal and waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal and has produced 33 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., a chest) contains the items you intend to extract. Verify the entity's inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target tile is occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n- Ensure that the placement area is clear of any obstacles, such as items on the ground or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Verify that inserters are properly aligned and fueled to ensure they can transfer items effectively between entities."}
