{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) which is currently working, fueled by coal, and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0), fueled with coal, and working to produce steam.\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-1.5, y=24.5), generating electricity.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), supplying water to the system.\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump, facilitating the flow of water and steam.\n\n### Lab Facility\n- Lab at an unspecified position, working on research with automation science packs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to retrieve entities that do not exist\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. In this case, there was an attempt to access a Lab at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) where no such entity existed. Double-check the positions and types of entities on the map to avoid such errors."}
