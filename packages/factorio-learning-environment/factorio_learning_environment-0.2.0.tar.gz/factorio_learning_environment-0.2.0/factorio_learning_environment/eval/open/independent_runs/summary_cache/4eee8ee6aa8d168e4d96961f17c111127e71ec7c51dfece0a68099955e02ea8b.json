Regularly check and replenish your coal supply to prevent interruptions in production.\n\n### Furnace Production Issues\n- The furnace has repeatedly produced 0 iron plates. Ensure that the furnace has a continuous supply of iron ore and coal to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- The chest at drop position is full. Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent overflow and ensure continuous operation of the mining drill.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Refueling\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and has enough fuel to transfer items between entities efficiently. Regularly check the inserter's alignment and fuel status."}
