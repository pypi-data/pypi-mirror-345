Check the inventory of the entity before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors in Transferring Iron Ore to Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnaces are accessible and have the necessary space for the items you are trying to transfer. Ensure that the furnaces are not full and have the correct input slots available.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to continue operations smoothly. Ensure that the chests at drop positions have enough space to receive items.\n\n### Errors with Missing Entities\n- Verify the presence and correct placement of entities like chests before attempting operations that involve them. Ensure that the entities are not misplaced or missing from the expected positions."}
