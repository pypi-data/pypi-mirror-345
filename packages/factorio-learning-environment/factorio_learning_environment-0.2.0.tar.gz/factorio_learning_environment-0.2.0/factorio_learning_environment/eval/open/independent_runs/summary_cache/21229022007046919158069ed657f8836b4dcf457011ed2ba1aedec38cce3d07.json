{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which is currently full.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that is waiting for space in the destination.\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) which contains coal.\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that is waiting for source items.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently without ingredients.\n- Iron ore (inventory: 4) is available for processing.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting into a full chest\n- Ensure to empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) before attempting to insert more items into the burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0).\n\n### Errors when inserting items from an empty inventory\n- Verify that you have sufficient items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any entity. The error indicates that there was an attempt to insert coal when none was available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: This function was invoked multiple times. It failed when trying to insert coal due to insufficient inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_coal`: int\n- `burner_mining_drill_2`: BurnerMiningDrill\n- `burner_mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill\n- `quantity`: int"}
