We should continue to monitor the first furnace as it processes the remaining iron ore.\n2. Once it finishes processing, we can extract the produced iron plates and consider gathering more iron ore or crafting items.\n\nLet\u2019s wait again briefly to see how many more iron plates are produced after a little more time.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the first furnace to continue processing\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration if needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after additional waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-212]"}
