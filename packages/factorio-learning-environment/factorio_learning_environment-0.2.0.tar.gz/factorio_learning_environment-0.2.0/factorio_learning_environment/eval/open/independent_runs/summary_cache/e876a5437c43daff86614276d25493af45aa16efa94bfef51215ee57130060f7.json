{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5) \n- Boiler (position -25.5, 20.0) \n- Offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5) \n- Small electric poles (multiple positions: -16.5, 18.5; -16.5, 19.5; -16.5, 20.5; -19.5, 22.5; -16.5, 21.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position -17.5, 23.5)\n\n### Assembling machine factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to pipe groups\n- Ensure that the boiler is within range of a working pipe group before attempting to connect. Check the positions of both the boiler and the pipe group to confirm connectivity.\n\n### Errors with boiler and steam engine not operational\n- Verify that the boiler has a water source and is connected to a working pipe group. Ensure that the steam engine is connected to the boiler and has access to steam.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
