{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) storing coal for the furnaces.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) storing coal for the furnaces.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) storing coal for the furnaces.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure to regularly remove processed items from furnaces to prevent them from reaching a full output status, which halts production.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to transfer. Regularly check and refill the source entity if necessary.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined in the current steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n  - `entities`: List[Entity] - Represents entities on the map, including their type, position, status, and inventory details."}
