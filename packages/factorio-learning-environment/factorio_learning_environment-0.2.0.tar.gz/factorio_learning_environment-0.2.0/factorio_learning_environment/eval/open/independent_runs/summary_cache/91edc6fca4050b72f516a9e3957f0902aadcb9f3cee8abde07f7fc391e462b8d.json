For example, when crafting `automation-science-pack`, ensure that both `copper-plate` and `iron-gear-wheel` are available or can be crafted.\n- When a sub-ingredient is missing, identify the crafting steps for that sub-ingredient and ensure those steps are executed first. For example, `iron-gear-wheel` requires `iron-plate`, which requires smelting `iron-ore` in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when crafting items that require research\n- Some items cannot be crafted until the required technology is researched. Ensure the necessary technology is researched before attempting to craft the item. For example, `assembling-machine-1` requires `automation` technology.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Before inserting items into an entity, ensure that the items exist in the agent's inventory.\n- Before inserting items into an entity, ensure that the entity is the correct type.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n -  Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place a entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions:\n\nNone\n\n### Important Variables:\n\nNone\n```"}
