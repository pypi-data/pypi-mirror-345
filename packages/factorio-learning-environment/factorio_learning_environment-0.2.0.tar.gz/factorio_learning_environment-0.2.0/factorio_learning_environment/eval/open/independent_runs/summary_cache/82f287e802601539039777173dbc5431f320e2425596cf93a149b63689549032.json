Verify that you are passing the correct type.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. Check your inventory to confirm the presence of the item you wish to insert.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target location."}
