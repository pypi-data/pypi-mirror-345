{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: No Fuel\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (691 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Neighbours:\n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure the inserter pickup position is aligned with the chest position to facilitate the transfer of items. Misalignment can cause the inserter to fail in transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of mining drills and inserters. Ensure they are refueled to maintain continuous operation. Running out of fuel will halt production processes.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels closely to prevent running out during critical operations. Ensure coal is available in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities or insert items.\n\n### Assertion Errors in Code\n- Verify that the code logic correctly checks for alignment and resource availability before executing actions. Assertions failing due to misalignment or resource checks should be addressed by reviewing the logic and ensuring conditions are met before proceeding."}
