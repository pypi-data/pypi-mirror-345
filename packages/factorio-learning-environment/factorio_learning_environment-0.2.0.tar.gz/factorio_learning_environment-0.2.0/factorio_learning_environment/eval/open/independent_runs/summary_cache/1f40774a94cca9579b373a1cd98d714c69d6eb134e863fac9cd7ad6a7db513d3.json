Currently has a warning: \"furnace result is full\".\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) converting iron ore to iron plates. Currently has a warning: \"furnace result is full\".\n- Wooden Chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) storing coal for the furnaces.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Furnace Output Overflow\n- Ensure that the output inventory of the furnaces is regularly emptied to prevent production halts due to full output slots. Consider using inserters to automate the transfer of finished products to storage chests.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the player's current inventory items and their counts."}
