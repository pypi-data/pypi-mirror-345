{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Network\nThe power network has been verified and expanded multiple times, connecting the lab at position (5.5, 5.5) to the power source at position (10.5, 34.5). It consists of multiple electricity poles at various positions including but not limited to (9.5, 23.5), (13.5, 27.5), (7.5, 13.5), (7.5, 9.5), (16.5, 31.5), and (12.5, 34.5).\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, with pipes at positions such as (-3.5, 26.5), (-2.5, 26.5), and (1.5, 26.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -82.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -82.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n- BeltGroup transporting coal with belts at positions such as (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5) and (43.5, -84.5) to (45.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n\n### Lab at Position (5.5, 5.5)\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently without power.\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Burner Inserters at positions (54.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### No Pipe Group Found\n- Ensure that all necessary pipe connections are established to form a complete pipe group. Check the connections to ensure they are properly linked.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to the steam engine via pipes and that there is a continuous flow of water from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as the burner mining drill and boiler to avoid interruptions in operations.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Monitor and empty chests regularly to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage capacity.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt, and check the supply chain feeding into the furnace to maintain continuous production."}
