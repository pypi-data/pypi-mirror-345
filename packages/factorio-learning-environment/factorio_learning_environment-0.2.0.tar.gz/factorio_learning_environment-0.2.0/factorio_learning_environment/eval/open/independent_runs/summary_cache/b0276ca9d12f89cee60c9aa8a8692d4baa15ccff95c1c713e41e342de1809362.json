{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)**: Currently has no ingredients to smelt and its result inventory is full. It is fueled by coal.\n- **Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)**: Working status, fueled by coal, with iron ore in the source inventory and iron plates in the result inventory.\n- **Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)**: Working status, fueled by coal, with iron ore in the source inventory and iron plates in the result inventory.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0)**: Working status, fueled by coal. It is dropping iron ore into a chest at position (4.5, -58.5), which is currently full.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from halting due to a full drop position.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients (iron ore) to maintain production efficiency. Regularly check the source inventory of furnaces to avoid downtime.\n\n### Furnace Result Full\n- Regularly remove finished products (iron plates) from the furnace result inventory to prevent production stoppage.\n\n### No Coal Available for Refueling\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel burner mining drills and furnaces to avoid production interruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n- `coal`: int = 5\n- `iron-ore`: int = 15\n- `iron-plate`: int = 1835\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int = 4"}
