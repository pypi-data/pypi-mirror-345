{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump to the steam engine (positions include various pipe connections)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position (0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace at position (5, 5)\n\n### Lab at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 0, 0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the distance between entities does not exceed the maximum connection distance for pipes. If it does, add intermediate pipes to bridge the gap.\n- Make sure to place pipes correctly by checking the positions of the entities being connected to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a power network. Check for any disconnected entities and rectify the connections."}
