{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 2.5) \n- Small electric pole (position 0.5, 1.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 2.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Lab at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 3.5, 0.5)\n\n### Chest at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new poles\n- Ensure that the direction argument is specified correctly when placing a new pole to avoid multiple value errors.\n- The second argument must be a Direction object; check the function call to ensure the correct types are being passed.\n\n### Errors related to lab power\n- The lab requires a power source to function. Ensure that it is connected to an electricity generator or has sufficient power supply.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors related to missing ingredients for research\n- Ensure that you have the required ingredients in your inventory to complete research tasks. In this case, 10 automation science packs are needed for Automation research."}
