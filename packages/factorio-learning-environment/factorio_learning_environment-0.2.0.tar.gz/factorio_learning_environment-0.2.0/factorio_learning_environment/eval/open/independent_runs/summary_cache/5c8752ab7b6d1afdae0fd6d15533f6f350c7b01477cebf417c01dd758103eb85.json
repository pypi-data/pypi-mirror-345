{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5)\n\n### Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab connected to power network with electrical ID 343\n- Research ongoing for automation\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal and smelting iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Undefined Entities\n- Ensure all entities used in the code are defined before use. For example, the 'Lab' entity was not defined, leading to a NameError.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between entities. Multiple failures occurred when attempting to connect pipes from the offshore pump to the boiler and from the boiler to the steam engine. Verify the connections and ensure the correct placement of pipes.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Working\n- Verify the status of the steam engine. Ensure it is connected to the power network and has the necessary input liquid. This can be checked by ensuring all pipes are correctly connected and the boiler is fueled.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal to refuel the boiler. Harvest additional coal when inventory levels are low to prevent the boiler from running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure that the necessary items are available in the inventory before attempting to connect pipes or refuel entities. For example, a failure occurred due to a lack of required items in the inventory for pipe connection.\n\n### Errors with Lab Power Connection\n- Ensure the lab is connected to the power network to avoid errors related to no power supply. This can be done by checking the connections and ensuring the lab is within the power grid."}
