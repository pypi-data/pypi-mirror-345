{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0), which is currently full of iron plates. It is fueled by coal and processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0), fueled by coal, which extracts coal and outputs it onto a transport belt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5), which moves coal from the mining drill to the transport belt.\n- Transport Belt system consisting of:\n  - Belt from position (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) moving right.\n  - Belt from position (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5) moving down.\n  - Belt from position (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5) moving left.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the intended position for placing entities like Wooden Chests is not obstructed or occupied by another entity before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors with transport belt connections\n- Verify that transport belts can be extended or reconnected at the intended positions to ensure a continuous flow of materials.\n\n### Errors due to output blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage and halt in production.\n\n### Errors with full output entities\n- Regularly check and clear the output inventory of entities like Stone Furnaces to prevent production halts due to full output status."}
