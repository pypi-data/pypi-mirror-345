{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (-2.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -2.0, -76.0) mining iron ore\n- Iron chest (position -1.5, -74.5) storing iron ore\n- Burner inserter (position -0.5, -74.5) to move items from chest\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, -77.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Copper/Iron Production Line at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -21.0, -73.0) mining copper and iron ore\n- Iron chest (position -21.5, -74.5) for storing ore\n- Burner inserter (position -20.5, -74.5) to move items\n- Stone furnace (position -19.0, -74.0) for smelting ore\n\n### Standalone Furnaces at (3.0, -73.0)\nTwo connected furnaces:\n- Stone furnace (position 3.0, -73.0)\n- Stone furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing an inserter or any other entity, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- At step 56, attempt to place burner-inserter at (-1.5, -75.5) failed because the space was occupied\n- Use the entity map data to verify if a position is free before attempting placement\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) has run out of fuel and stopped working\n- Ensure mining drills are regularly supplied with fuel to maintain continuous operation\n\n### System Efficiency Issues\n- Multiple furnaces are idle with \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n- Ensure proper connection between resource extraction and processing facilities\n- Set up proper logistics chains to keep furnaces supplied with materials"}
