For example, attempting to insert copper ore when none is available will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Make sure that the source items are available for the inserter to pick up. If an inserter is waiting for source items, check the supply chain to ensure that items are being delivered to the inserter's pickup position."}
