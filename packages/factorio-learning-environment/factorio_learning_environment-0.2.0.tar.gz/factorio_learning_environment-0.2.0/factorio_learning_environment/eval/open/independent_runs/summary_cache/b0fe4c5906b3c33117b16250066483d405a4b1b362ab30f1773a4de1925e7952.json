{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - working, producing water\n- Boiler (x=-6.5, y=0.0) - now fueled with coal (21 remaining), producing steam\n- Steam engine (x=-2.5, y=0.5) - working, connected to power network\n- Pipe network (system 1125/1126) connecting all components\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - working, producing crude oil\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - powered, set to BasicOilProcessing but showing FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - empty, not receiving petroleum gas\n- Chemical plant (x=37.5, y=40.5) - powered, set to PlasticBar recipe but showing FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE\n- Wooden chest with coal (x=37.5, y=37.5) - contains 146 coal\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - now powered but output blocked\n- Disconnected pipe networks at multiple positions (x=18.5,28.5,29.5,31.5 y=38.5,43.5,37.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid connection failures\n- Repeated attempts to connect empty storage tank to chemical plant:\n  - Verify refinery is producing petroleum gas before connecting storage tank\n  - Check pipe connections between refinery and storage tank first\n  - Ensure all intermediate pipes are properly connected in sequence\n\n### Pipe system issues\n- Multiple disconnected pipe groups in oil facility:\n  - Connect pumpjack to refinery first (x=18.5 to x=28.5)\n  - Then connect refinery output to storage tank (x=29.5 to x=31.5)\n  - Finally connect storage tank to chemical plant (x=31.5 to x=38.5)\n\n### Inserter operation problems\n- Inserter at x=37.5 y=38.5 still shows \"output blocked\":\n  - Clear any items at drop position (x=37.5 y=39.5)\n  - Verify chemical plant can accept items at this position\n\n### Previous errors still applicable:\n- Power connection issues (verify all connections)\n- Fluid system verification (check all connections sequentially)\n- Production monitoring (verify refinery output before connecting downstream)\n- Entity inspection (check fluid contents before connection attempts)"}
