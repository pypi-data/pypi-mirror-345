{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Burner mining drill facing DOWN\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n- Mining from coal resource patch (20000 units)\n\n### Dual Furnace Smelting System at (46.0, -81.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) feeding the furnaces\n- Input wooden chest at (46.5, -83.5)\n- Both furnaces have coal fuel (50 units each)\n\n### Iron Ore Input System at (46.5, -78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Input wooden chest at (46.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Two burner inserters at (46.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5)\n- Belt network:\n  - Center distribution belt at (46.5, -79.5)\n  - Left furnace input belt at (45.5, -79.5)\n  - Right furnace input belt at (47.5, -79.5)\n\n### Storage System\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing coal\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing belts\n- Check for existing entities that might block belt placement\n- Verify you have the required items in inventory before placement (e.g., splitter placement failed due to missing splitter)\n\n### Entity Blocking Issues\n- Transport belt at (46.5, -79.5) is blocked, preventing proper operation\n- Clear blocked belts to ensure smooth material flow\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drill is out of fuel and non-operational\n- Ensure continuous fuel supply to burner mining drills\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pickup_position`: Position - Coordinates where inserters collect items\n- `drop_position`: Position - Coordinates where inserters place items\n- `direction`: Direction - Entity orientation (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- `status`: EntityStatus - Current operational status of entities\n- `inventory`: Inventory - Container contents\n\n### Entity States\n- `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`: Furnaces waiting for input materials\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`: Inserters waiting for items to move\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION`: Inserters blocked by full destination\n- `EntityStatus.NO_FUEL`: Mining equipment without fuel\n- `EntityStatus.NORMAL`: Standard operational state\n- `EntityStatus.WORKING`: Active operational state"}
