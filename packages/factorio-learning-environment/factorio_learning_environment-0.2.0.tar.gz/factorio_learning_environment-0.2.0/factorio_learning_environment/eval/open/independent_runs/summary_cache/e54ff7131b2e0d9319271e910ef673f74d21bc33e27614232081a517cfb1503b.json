{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Copper plate mine at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) and a furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position (39.5, -79.5)) that puts into furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n-  Belt group (position (39.5, -83.5)) that connects the burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) to the furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n\n### Offshore pump and boiler system at position(105.5, -32.5)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Offshore pump (position (105.5, -32.5)) connected to a pipe group (fluid system 247959) that supplies water to a boiler at position (111.5, -32.0)\n-  Boiler (position (111.5, -32.0)) that uses the water from the offshore pump to produce steam\n-  Steam engine (position (117.5, -30.5)) that uses the steam from the boiler to generate electricity\n-  Small electric pole (position (111.5, -30.5)) that connects the steam engine to the electricity grid\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n-  Ensure that the correct number of arguments is passed to the connect_entities function. The function takes 3 positional arguments, but 5 were given in some cases.\n-  Ensure that the positions passed to the connect_entities function are integers, not floats.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n-  Ensure that the tile where the entity is being placed is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   Defined functions:\n    *   `connect_entities`: a function that connects two entities with a pipe.\n*   Important variables:\n    *   `offshore_pump`: an offshore pump entity.\n    *   `boiler`: a boiler entity.\n    *   `Prototype.Pipe`: a pipe prototype.\n    *   `Position`: a class representing a position on the map."}
