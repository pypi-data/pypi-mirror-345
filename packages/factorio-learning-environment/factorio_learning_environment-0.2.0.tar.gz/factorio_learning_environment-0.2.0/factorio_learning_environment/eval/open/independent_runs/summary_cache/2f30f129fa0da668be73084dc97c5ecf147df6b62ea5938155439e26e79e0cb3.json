{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to extract iron ore, transfer it to a furnace, and produce iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Extracting Items from Non-Existent Entities\n- Ensure that the target entity, such as a chest, exists and contains the desired items before attempting to extract items from it.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Fuel\n- Regularly check and maintain an adequate supply of fuel (coal) for all fuel-dependent entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities effectively. Misalignment can cause production delays or stoppages."}
