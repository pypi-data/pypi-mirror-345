Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the inserters have access to source items and are correctly positioned to pick up items from the belt or chest. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that there is a continuous flow of items to the inserters.\n\n### General Maintenance\n- Regularly inspect all entities for operational status and warnings. Address any issues such as \"waiting for source items\" or \"out of fuel\" promptly to ensure smooth operation of all facilities."}
