{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n---------------------\n### Copper Cable Factory at (2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n\u2022 Burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) placed using direction RIGHT to interface with the factory.\n\u2022 Factory burner inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5) (listed as a neighbour) providing an upstream connection.\n\u2022 Cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5) serving as the primary input.\n\u2022 Assembling machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5) linked as the production output.\n\n### Belt Depot for Extraction Connection at (3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n\u2022 Wooden chest depot placed at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) to act as an isolated belt target.\n\u2022 Transport belt segment at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) positioned adjacent to the chest for material routing.\n\u2022 Depot burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) (using direction UP) to feed items from the depot.\n\n### Extraction System at (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n\u2022 Extraction system burner inserter at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5) with its drop position at Position(x=-3.5, y=28.5) to serve as the source for transporting copper plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n---------------------\n\u2022 Belt Connection Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 When connecting transport belts, the target must be a valid inserter rather than a steam engine. Always attach an inserter to funnel items into the target entity.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure you are within the placement range of the target position. If an entity (e.g. wooden chest at (3.5,15.5)) cannot be placed due to distance, move closer before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortfall Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm the required item (such as a wooden chest) is present in the inventory before issuing a placement command.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all variables (for example, target_chest) are correctly defined and in scope prior to usage to avoid NameError faults."}
