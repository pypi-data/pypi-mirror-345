{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5), currently fueled with coal and actively working.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (-15.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore and coal, producing iron plates.\n  - (-13.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore and coal, producing iron plates.\n  - (-11.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore and coal, producing iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions storing iron plates and iron ore, including:\n  - (4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Multiple chests in the range (-14.5, y=-50.5) to (-6.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates and iron ore.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-3.5, y=-52.5) storing a significant amount of iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-4.5, y=-52.5) and (-5.5, y=-52.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This error occurred multiple times when trying to insert iron ore into furnaces without having enough in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert fuel without having it\n- Before refueling drills or furnaces, confirm that you possess the necessary fuel in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: This function is used to insert items into entities. It failed when attempting to insert items not present in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **drill**: Represents a mining drill entity, used in context with inserting items.\n- **furnace**: Represents a furnace entity, used in context with inserting items."}
