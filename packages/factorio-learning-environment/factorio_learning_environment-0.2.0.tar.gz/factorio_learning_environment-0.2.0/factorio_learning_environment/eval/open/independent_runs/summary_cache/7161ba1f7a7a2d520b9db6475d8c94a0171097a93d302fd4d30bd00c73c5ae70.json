{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace\nUse-case: Processes iron ore into iron plates with an integrated collection point (wooden chest) for direct resource storage and management.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient production output and delayed processing\n- Verify that the processing cycle receives adequate time to complete so that enough outputs are available.\n- Adjust timing or processing cycles to better match extraction requirements.\n\n### Errors when inserting or extracting items despite resource unavailability\n- Confirm that the inventory or target structure contains the intended resource prior to action.\n- Double-check inventory levels and entity contents to prevent actions on empty entities.\n- When extracting from a collection point (wooden chest or furnace), ensure that the entity holds the required resource before extraction.\n- Consider re-checking the entity\u2019s inventory after expected processing to avoid extraction attempts on empty or outdated entities."}
