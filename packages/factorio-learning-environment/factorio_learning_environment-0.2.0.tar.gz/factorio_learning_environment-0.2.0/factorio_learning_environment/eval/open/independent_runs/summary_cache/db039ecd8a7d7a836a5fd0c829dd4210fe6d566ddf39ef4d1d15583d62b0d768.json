{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation (Updated)  \n- **Electric mining drills** at positions (15.5, 70.5), (18.5, 70.5), and (21.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore (status: `NO_POWER`).  \n- **Stone furnaces** at positions (16.0, 73.0), (19.0, 73.0), and (22.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates (status: `NO_INGREDIENTS`).  \n- **Output system** consisting of:  \n  - **Burner inserters** at (16.5, 74.5), (19.5, 74.5), and (22.5, 74.5) (status: `WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`).  \n  - **Wooden chests** at (16.5, 75.5), (19.5, 75.5), and (22.5, 75.5) (status: `NORMAL`).  \n\n#### Power Generation Setup (Updated)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) facing RIGHT, connected to a **pipe** at (-8.5, -0.5).  \n- **Boiler** at (-7.0, 0.5) with connection points at (-7.5, -1.5) and (-7.5, 2.5), now receiving water (status: `WORKING`).  \n- **Pipe network** consisting of pipes at (-8.5, -1.5), (-8.5, -0.5), and (-7.5, -1.5), now properly aligned with the boiler input.  \n- **Steam engine** not yet placed due to placement conflicts.  \n- **Small electric poles** placed but not forming a complete power network (electric mining drills and inserters still report `NO_POWER`).  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Placement Distance Errors  \n- **Entity too far to place**: Repeated attempts to place pipes, burner inserters, and offshore pumps failed due to distance (e.g., burner inserter at (16.5, 73.5) while player was at (0, 0)). Move within 10 tiles of the target before placing.  \n\n#### Entity Placement Conflicts  \n- **Existing objects blocking placement**:  \n  - Pipes at (11.0, 10.5), (-3.0, 0.0), and (-4.0, 0.5) failed due to water or existing entities. Clear the area first.  \n  - Burner inserter at (16.5, 72.5) blocked by an existing object. Verify tile occupancy before placement.  \n\n#### Power and Fluid System Issues  \n- **Steam engine placement**: Ensure land-based, unoccupied tiles (e.g., avoid (-3.0, 0.0) due to water).  \n- **Offshore pump errors**: Attempts to place at (20.0, 0.0) failed due to script errors. Verify water adjacency and script logic.  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Check entity statuses**: Prioritize resolving `NO_POWER` (connect poles) and `NO_INGREDIENTS` (supply ore to furnaces).  \n- **Debugging tools**: Use debug mode to inspect pipe connections and power grid coverage.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \nNo new functions or variables were defined by the agent in these steps."}
