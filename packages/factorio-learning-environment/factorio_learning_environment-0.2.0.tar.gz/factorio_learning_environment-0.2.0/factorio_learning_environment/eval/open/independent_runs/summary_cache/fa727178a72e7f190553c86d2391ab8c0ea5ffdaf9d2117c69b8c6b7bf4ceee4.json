{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- Consists of:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel, also not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage.\n  - Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole, not operational due to lack of power.\n  - Small Electric Poles surrounding the area for potential power distribution.\n\n### Power Generation Setup\n- Consists of:\n  - Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) not supplying water.\n  - Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) not receiving water, connected to pipes and a steam engine.\n  - Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) not connected to the power network, lacking fluid input.\n  - Pipe networks connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, but currently not functional.\n\n### Lab and Power Distribution\n- Consists of:\n  - Lab with automation science packs, not receiving power.\n  - Small Electric Poles intended to connect the lab and inserter to the power network, but currently not operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Fluid Systems\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that there are no missing connections or misplaced pipes.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connection\n- Verify that all small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to form a continuous power network. Ensure that the poles are within range of each other to transmit power effectively.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to connect entities or craft items, ensure that you have the required items in your inventory. For example, crafting more small electric poles was necessary to attempt further connections.\n\n### Errors with Non-Operational Entities\n- Check that all entities requiring power, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a functional power network. Address any warnings about entities not receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Input\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is correctly positioned and connected to supply water to the boiler. Check for any warnings about no fluid present in connections and address them promptly."}
