{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for iron ore extraction.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0) for copper ore extraction and smelting into copper plates.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-79.5) for storing items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the error at Step 913 occurred because there was no coal in the inventory to insert into the iron furnace.\n\n### Errors due to Entities Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. This can be done by maintaining a steady supply of raw materials to the furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: A function used to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It failed in Step 913 due to insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity where items are inserted.\n- `copper_mining_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity where items are inserted.\n- `iron_mining_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity where items are inserted."}
