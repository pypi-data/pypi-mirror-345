{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently fueled with coal.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest. Pickup position is (0.5, 0.5) and drop position is (2.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt. Pickup position is (2.5, 0.5) and drop position is (4.5, 0.5).\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the output of Burner Inserter 2 to Burner Inserter 3, facilitating the movement of iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to another wooden chest. Pickup position is (5.5, 0.5) and drop position is (7.5, 0.5).\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required resources\n- Verify that you have all necessary raw materials in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, ensure you have wood before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a transport belt. Direct connections from chests to belts are not possible.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory stock\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the items you intend to insert into an entity. For example, ensure you have coal before attempting to insert it into a burner inserter."}
