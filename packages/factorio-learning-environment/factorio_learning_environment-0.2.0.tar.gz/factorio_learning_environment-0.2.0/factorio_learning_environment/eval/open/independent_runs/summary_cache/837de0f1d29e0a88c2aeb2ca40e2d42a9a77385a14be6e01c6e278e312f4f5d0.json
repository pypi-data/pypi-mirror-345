{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5) with status WORKING\n- Pipe groups connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine with various statuses\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) with status NO_POWER\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5) with status NORMAL\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Pipe Group at position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) with status EMPTY\n- Pipe Group at position (x=5.5, y=-8.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT containing water\n- Pipe Group at position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT containing water\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions including (x=18.5, y=-15.5), (x=23.5, y=-12.5), and (x=-3.5, y=2.5) with voltage 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a tile before attempting placement. The error at position (20.5, y=-4.5) indicates an existing object was in the way.\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Entities\n- Verify the presence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. The error at position (18.5, y=-3.5) indicates the pipe was not found.\n\n### Errors with Unconnected Structures\n- Ensure all components of the electricity generator are properly connected to allow fluid flow and power generation. The steam engine and boiler are currently not connected.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters, are connected to a power source to function correctly. The inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) is currently not receiving electricity."}
