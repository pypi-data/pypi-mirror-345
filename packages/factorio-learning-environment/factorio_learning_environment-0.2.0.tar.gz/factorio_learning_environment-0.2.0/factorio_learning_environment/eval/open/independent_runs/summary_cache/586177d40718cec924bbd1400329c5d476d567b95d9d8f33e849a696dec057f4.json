{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but all attempts were unsuccessful due to buildability issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities like Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts is buildable. Check the terrain and surroundings to confirm that the area is clear and suitable for construction.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operations\n- Before attempting to place entities that require resources (e.g., supplying coal to a furnace), ensure that the necessary resources are available and accessible.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied or unsuitable\n- Confirm that the tile where you intend to place an entity is not already occupied by another entity or unsuitable for placement. Use the map to verify tile availability and suitability before placing.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the intended placement area is within the map's boundaries and adheres to any global build restrictions."}
