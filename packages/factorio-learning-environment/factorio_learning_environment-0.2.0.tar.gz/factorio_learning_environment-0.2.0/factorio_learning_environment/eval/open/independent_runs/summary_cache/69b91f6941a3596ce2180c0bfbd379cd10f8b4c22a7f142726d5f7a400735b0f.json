{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the power network at various positions\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with a full output of iron plates\n- Additional Stone Furnaces at Positions (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) intended to transfer items from the furnace to the chest, but not receiving electricity\n\n### Pipe Network\nMultiple Pipe Groups at various positions, all currently empty and not connected to any fluid system.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages before attempting to connect pipes. Check for any existing entities or terrain features that might obstruct the pipe connection.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Type in API Call\n- When using the `insert_item` function, ensure the second argument is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Correct the argument type to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Verify that all inserters are connected to a powered electric pole. Ensure the electric network is complete and functional to provide power to all connected devices."}
