{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5) and a wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) that is currently full.\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a wooden chest at (2.5, 0.5) containing iron plates. The furnace is currently out of ingredients to smelt and its output is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when refueling the Burner Mining Drill**\n  - Ensure that the chest at the drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is emptied to allow the burner mining drill to continue mining.\n\n- **Errors when feeding the Stone Furnace**\n  - Verify that the stone furnace has ingredients available to smelt before attempting to feed it. \n\n- **Errors when harvesting coal**\n  - Make sure to harvest coal only when necessary and ensure that the inventory has space to accommodate the harvested resources.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution logs.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Position(-15.0, -50.0)\n  - `stone_furnace_position`: Position(0.0, 0.0)\n  - `chest_position`: Position(-14.5, -48.5)\n  - `wooden_chest_position`: Position(2.5, 0.5)"}
