Always verify the target entity\u2019s type before attempting a connection.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Issues  \n\u2002\u2002When an error indicates that a placement target (for example, a wooden chest at (3.5,15.5)) is too far from the player\u2019s current position, move closer to the target before trying to place the entity.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage Alerts  \n\u2002\u2002If placement fails due to the required item not being in inventory (as occurred with the wooden chest), confirm that the item is available before initiating placement.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Warnings  \n\u2002\u2002Review and correct variable names (for example, ensuring that \u2018target_chest\u2019 is defined) to prevent NameError exceptions."}
