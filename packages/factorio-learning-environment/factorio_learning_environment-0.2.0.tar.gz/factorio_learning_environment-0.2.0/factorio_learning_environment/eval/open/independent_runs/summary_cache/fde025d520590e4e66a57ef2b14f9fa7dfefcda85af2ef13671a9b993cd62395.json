{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. It is currently working but has a warning that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, indicating no sink entity is in place to accept the output.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) with a fuel inventory of coal. It is waiting for source items and has a warning that the chest is full.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. It is working but has a warning that the furnace result is full, indicating the output inventory is full of iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Transport Belt** at position (x=43.5, y=-82.5) and (x=43.5, y=-80.5), aligned correctly. It connects the burner mining drill to the burner inserter and facilitates the movement of items between entities.\n\n### Belt Group\n- Inputs: Belt from (x=42.5, y=-82.5) to (x=44.5, y=-82.5), direction RIGHT; Belt from (x=43.5, y=-81.5) to (x=43.5, y=-79.5), direction DOWN.\n- Outputs: Belt from (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=42.5, y=-79.5), direction LEFT.\n- Status: EMPTY, consisting of 7 belts in total.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters failed because the target positions were occupied.\n\n### Errors due to full output\n- Regularly check and clear the output of entities like furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. The Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) has a full output inventory, which stops further production.\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or a clear path for outputs from entities like mining drills to prevent blockage. The Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) has a blocked output warning.\n\n### Errors with full chests\n- Monitor and manage the inventory of chests and inserters to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt the transfer of items between entities. The Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) has a full chest warning."}
