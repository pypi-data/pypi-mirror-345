{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo permanent structures have been successfully placed by the agent. Repeated attempts were made to deploy a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to research, but these efforts failed due to inventory shortages and unmet crafting prerequisites. All other operations (such as smelting in existing furnaces) utilized pre\u2010existing structures rather than constructing new ones.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors for get_entities()\n  - Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) and do not supply unexpected positional arguments. Always validate against the API signature to prevent TypeErrors.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Issues\n  - Verify inventory contents before attempting to place a Lab; errors indicating \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d show that placement was attempted without ensuring availability.\n  - When retrieving entities (such as Labs), confirm the call returns an iterable rather than None to avoid iteration errors.\n  - Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, copper-cables, electronic-circuits) are available and that their production chains (e.g., sufficient iron-plate and copper-plate supply through smelting) are established before crafting a Lab.\n  - Monitor for recurring shortages (such as missing iron-gear-wheel units) and adjust resource production accordingly to meet crafting prerequisites."}
