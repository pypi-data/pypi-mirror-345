Verify and use the active fluid_system identifier (e.g. 32100, as now in use by the boiler and pump) before initiating connection attempts.\n- Rigid Pipeline Stabilization:\n  - The recurring use of fixed 10-second delays for pipeline stabilization results in avoidable waiting. Replace static delays with dynamic checks to proceed immediately once connectivity is confirmed."}
