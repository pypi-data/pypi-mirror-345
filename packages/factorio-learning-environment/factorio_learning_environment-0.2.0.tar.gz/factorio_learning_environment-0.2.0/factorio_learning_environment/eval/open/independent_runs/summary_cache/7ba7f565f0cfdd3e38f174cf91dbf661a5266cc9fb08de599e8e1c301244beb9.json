{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) facilitating movement between chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and another at position (5.0, 0.0) with Wooden Chests at positions (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), and others storing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) facilitating movement between chests and belts.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5) for material transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using non-callable objects\n- Ensure that you are not attempting to call objects that are not functions or methods. For instance, a 'Chest' object cannot be called like a function. Double-check the intended use of the object and correct the syntax.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory or storage\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests and furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Empty chests at critical points like (52.5, -84.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. This can be managed by maintaining a steady supply of resources to the input chests or belts feeding the inserters."}
