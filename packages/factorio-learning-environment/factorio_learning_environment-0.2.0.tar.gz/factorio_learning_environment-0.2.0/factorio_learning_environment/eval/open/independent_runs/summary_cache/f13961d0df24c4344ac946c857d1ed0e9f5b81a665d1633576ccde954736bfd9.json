{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) moving items between a wooden chest and a stone furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) moving items between a wooden chest and a stone furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (19.5, 0.5) moving items between wooden chests.\n- Burner Inserter at position (20.5, 0.5) moving items between wooden chests.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (8.5, -0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (17.5, -0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (19.5, -0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (20.5, -0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (8.5, 1.5) containing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (17.5, 1.5) containing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (19.5, 1.5) containing iron ore.\n\n### Lab\n- Lab at position (unknown) with automation science packs and currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup at position (17.5, 3.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 11.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 18.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 21.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (18.5, 21.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (22.5, 20.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 23.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 22.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (14.5, 22.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (16.5, 23.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (7.5, 24.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (-2.5, 27.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 27.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (35.5, 27.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, currently with no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a pipe. This will prevent placement errors due to obstacles.\n\n### Errors during automatic pipe connection\n- Verify that the connection path for pipes is clear and that there are no obstacles that would prevent successful connection between points.\n\n### Lab power issues\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a powered electricity network to avoid the \"NO_POWER\" status. Check the electricity network for connectivity and power supply issues.\n\n### Errors when placing underground pipes\n- Ensure that the path for underground pipes is clear of obstacles and that the starting and ending points are correctly aligned to facilitate a successful connection."}
