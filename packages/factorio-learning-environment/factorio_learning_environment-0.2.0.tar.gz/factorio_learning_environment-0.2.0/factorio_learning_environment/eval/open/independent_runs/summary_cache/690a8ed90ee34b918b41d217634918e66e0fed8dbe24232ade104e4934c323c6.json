{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (9.5, 35.5)\n- Boilers at positions (1.5, 18.0), (-9.5, 22.0), (-3.5, 22.0), and (0.5, 22.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (6.5, 15.5) to power offshore pump\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have all necessary materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items such as small electric poles.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Make sure there is no overlap with water or other entities when placing structures like small electric poles. Try a different location if placement fails due to overlap.\n\n### Connection Failures\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory, such as small electric poles, before attempting to connect entities to the power grid.\n- Verify that all connections are properly established, especially when connecting boilers and steam engines to the power grid.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Offshore Pump\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected from the offshore pump to the boilers. Check for any missing connections or incorrect placements.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- Current inventory: A dictionary containing items and their quantities, such as 'iron-chest', 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', etc.\n- Positions of entities like boilers, steam engines, and offshore pumps are tracked for connection purposes."}
