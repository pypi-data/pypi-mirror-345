{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with an inventory containing 100 copper plates and a fuel inventory containing 3 coal. The furnace is currently not smelting due to no ingredients and has a status of NO_INGREDIENTS.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Factory\nThis factory is composed of the furnace and the wooden chest, which together facilitate the production and storage of copper plates. The furnace smelts copper ore into copper plates, while the wooden chest stores the finished copper plates for later use.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients**: \n  - Ensure that the required ingredients for crafting are available in the inventory or in the connected machines. In this case, the automation science pack requires copper plates, which are not being produced due to the furnace being idle.\n  \n- **Errors when transferring items to the chest**:\n  - Check the inventory of the chest to ensure it has enough space to accept items before attempting to transfer. The log indicates that there were no copper plates available in the inventory to transfer to the chest.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to the absence of required ingredients (copper plates).\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary containing items in the player's inventory (type: dict).\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Inventory of the furnace (type: Inventory).\n  - `chest_inventory`: Inventory of the wooden chest (type: Inventory)."}
