{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Positions (61.0, -54.0) and (64.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), currently out of fuel, intended to mine coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal, connected to the burner mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) storing coal, connected to the burner inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Out of Fuel in Mining Drill\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill is adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed to avoid interruptions in coal mining.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Resources\n- Ensure proximity to the target entity (e.g., furnaces) when extracting resources to avoid extraction errors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
