{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler at positions [(x=19.5, y=-2.5), (x=18.5, y=-2.5), (x=18.5, y=-3.5)]\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions to connect the generator to the power grid\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mine at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=19.5, y=18.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) that puts items into the assembling machine\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Pipe Group at Position (x=4.5, y=-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pipes at positions [(x=4.5, y=-9.5), (x=5.5, y=-9.5), (x=5.5, y=-8.5), ..., (x=6.5, y=-7.5), (x=7.5, y=-7.5), (x=8.5, y=-7.5)]\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions to connect different entities to the power grid\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Steam Engine to Boiler\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connection\n- Verify that all small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to form a continuous network. Ensure that poles are within range of each other and the entities they are supposed to power.\n\n### Errors in Assembling Machine Operation\n- Ensure the assembling machine has the necessary resources (e.g., copper plates) to produce the intended products. Check that the inserter is correctly positioned and powered to supply resources.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operation\n- Make sure inserters are powered and correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Verify that they have a clear path to operate without obstruction.\n\n### Errors in Offshore Pump Connection\n- Confirm that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the pipe network and that there are no gaps or misalignments in the connection path."}
