{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection Structure\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)\n  - Currently mining coal.\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (40.5, -83.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5)\n  - Collects mined coal from the burner mining drill.\n  - Current inventory: 18 units of coal.\n\n### Iron Smelting Structure\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (61.0, -54.0)\n  - Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Current fuel inventory: 49 units of coal.\n  - Furnace source inventory: 4 units of iron ore.\n  - Furnace result inventory: 1 unit of iron plate.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Sub-Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron-plates require a furnace for smelting iron ore, and stone is a raw resource that must be gathered before crafting a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Verify that the required entity is present in the inventory before attempting to place it. For instance, attempting to place a wooden chest failed because there was no wooden chest in the inventory.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Recipes\n- Some items, such as wood, are raw resources that must be gathered rather than crafted. Ensure that the agent gathers these resources from the environment.\n\n### TypeError in Function Calls\n- Ensure that all required positional arguments are provided when invoking functions. For example, the ExtractItem function call was missing a required positional argument 'source'.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **place_entity**: Used for placing entities on the map. Ensure the entity is available in the inventory before placing.\n- **ExtractItem**: Ensure all required arguments are provided when calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **wooden_chest**: Represents the wooden chest entity placed on the map.\n- **burner_mining_drill**: Represents the burner mining drill entity placed on the map.\n- **stone_furnace**: Represents the stone furnace entity used for smelting iron ore."}
