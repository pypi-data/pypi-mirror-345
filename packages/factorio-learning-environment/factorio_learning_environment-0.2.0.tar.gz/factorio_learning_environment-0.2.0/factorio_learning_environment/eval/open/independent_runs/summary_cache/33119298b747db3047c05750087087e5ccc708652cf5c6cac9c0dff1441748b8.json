{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully built on the map. Multiple attempts were made to craft and place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded due to inventory and resource shortages. No other composite structures (such as integrated smelting or mining setups) were created by the agent in these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Call Misuse \u2013 get_entities Errors  \n  - Ensure the function is called according to its defined signature. Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (e.g., remove \u201cradius\u201d) and do not supply unintended positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Handling Empty Returns from get_entities  \n  - When no entities are returned (i.e. a None value is received), default to an empty list before attempting any iteration or filtering to prevent \u201cNoneType\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures  \n  - Verify that the Lab item is available in the inventory before attempting placement. Confirm that the target tile is unoccupied and proper placement parameters are provided.\n\n\u2022 Resource Shortages in Lab Crafting  \n  - Lab crafting repeatedly failed due to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable). Ensure that sufficient resources and production capabilities (e.g. smelting iron and copper, and producing intermediary components) are in place before initiating Lab production."}
