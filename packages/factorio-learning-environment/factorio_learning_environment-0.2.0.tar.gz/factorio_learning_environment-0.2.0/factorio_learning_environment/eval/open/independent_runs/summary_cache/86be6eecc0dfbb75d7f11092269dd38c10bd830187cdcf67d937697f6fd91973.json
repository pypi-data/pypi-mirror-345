For example, when connecting a steam engine to a power pole, ensure you are referencing the correct position and not using an incorrect attribute.\n\n### Errors when the steam engine is not receiving power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to a power network and that it has a sufficient water supply. Check the connections and ensure that there are no breaks in the power lines.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
