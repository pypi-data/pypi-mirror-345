{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which moves iron plates from the furnace to another chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) which stores the produced iron plates.\n\n### Secondary Furnace Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) which is intended for additional smelting of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) which is supposed to transfer items to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) which serves as a storage for resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- **Ensure Inventory Space**: Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the entity's inventory has enough space to accommodate the items. Multiple attempts to insert iron plates into a furnace failed due to a full inventory.\n\n### Errors Related to Resource Availability\n- **Check Resource Availability**: Before trying to insert resources like coal into a furnace, verify that your inventory contains the required resources. An attempt to insert coal into a furnace failed due to the absence of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Inserter Operation Errors\n- **Ensure Inserter Source and Destination Availability**: Make sure that inserters have access to source items and that their destination is not blocked. Several inserters were waiting for source items or had blocked drop positions, causing operational delays."}
