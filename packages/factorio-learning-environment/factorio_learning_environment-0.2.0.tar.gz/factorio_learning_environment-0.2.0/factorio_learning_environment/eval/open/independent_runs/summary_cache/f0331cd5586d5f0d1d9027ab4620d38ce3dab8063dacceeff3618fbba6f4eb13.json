Monitor fuel levels rigorously and, upon encountering NO_FUEL errors, address the fuel shortage promptly.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure sufficient coal is available before attempting to fuel furnaces; if \u201cNo coal\u201d insertion errors occur, harvest additional coal.\n\n\u2022 CRAFTING CHAIN & INVENTORY VERIFICATION:\n\u2003\u2013 When crafting complex items like Steam Engines, verify that all dependent sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels and iron-plates) are available. Ensure furnaces are properly fueled and smelting processes are effective.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the crafted entity is present in the inventory before attempting placement to avoid inventory-related errors.\n\n\u2022 STEAM ENGINE PLACEMENT ERRORS:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate candidate build positions and verify that the target area is unoccupied by obstructions such as pipes, water tiles, electric poles, labs, or transport belts.\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple placement attempts (using directions LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, and UP) have failed due to collisions. Adjust spacing, change orientation, or select an alternative reference position to clear nearby blocking entities.\n\u2003\u2013 Pre\u2010validate buildable areas to ensure that connection points and targeted positions are unobstructed.\n\n\u2022 UNDERGROUND PIPE CRAFTING & TYPE HANDLING:\n\u2003\u2013 Before crafting UndergroundPipes or invoking API functions, check that all required sub-ingredients are available.\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid calling non-callable objects (such as Position instances) as functions by accessing their attributes directly.\n\n\u2022 TILE & CONNECTION VALIDATION:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-validate target tile availability and connection feasibility to prevent occupancy conflicts.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that connection points for both Steam Engines and Boilers are clear of obstructions to enable successful linking.\n\n\u2022 MIXED CONNECTION ERRORS:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that both source and target connection points are free from nearby obstructions (e.g., pipes, electric poles, water) to avoid conflicts during generator or boiler connections.\n\u2003\u2013 Reassess connection strategies if repeated failures occur, as mixed connection errors may indicate overlapping placement or type incompatibility."}
