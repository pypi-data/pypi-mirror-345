{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-20.0, -70.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-23.5, -69.5) storing extracted copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) processing copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore and copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron and Copper Ore Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions storing iron ore and copper ore.\n\n### Inserter and Chest Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Burner Inserters and Wooden Chests at various positions, facilitating the transfer of resources between chests.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup connecting various chests and inserters, facilitating the movement of resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of items to pick up. Check the supply chain to ensure resources are being delivered to the source chest.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials to process. Check the supply chain to ensure resources are being delivered to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Output Blocked by Items on the Ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity (like a chest or another inserter) in place to accept the output from inserters to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with Entity Not Found at Specified Position\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it."}
