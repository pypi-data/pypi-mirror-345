{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler requires water and fuel to produce steam, which powers the steam engine for electricity generation.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) that extracts iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to missing inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or connect entities. For instance, you cannot connect the boiler to the steam engine without pipes, and you cannot place the offshore pump if it is not in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
