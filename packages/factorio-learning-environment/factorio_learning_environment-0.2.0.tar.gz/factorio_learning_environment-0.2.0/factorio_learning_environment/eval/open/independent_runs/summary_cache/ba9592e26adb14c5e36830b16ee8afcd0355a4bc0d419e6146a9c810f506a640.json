{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate furnace at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position x1) that smelts copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when crafting Automation Science Pack**:\n  - Ensure you have enough copper plates available in your inventory before attempting to craft the Automation Science Pack. The recipe requires 1 copper plate, which must be available either in your inventory or in a connected furnace.\n  \n- **Errors when transferring items to the chest**:\n  - Ensure you have copper plates in your inventory before attempting to transfer them to the chest. If your inventory is empty of copper plates, the transfer will fail.\n\n- **Errors when inserting items**:\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before trying to insert them into another entity. If you attempt to insert items that you do not possess, the operation will fail.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: Failed due to insufficient copper plates.\n  - `insert_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, chest, quantity=copper_to_transfer)`: Failed multiple times due to lack of copper plates in inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `copper_to_transfer`: int\n  - `current_inventory`: dict\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `furnace_inventory`: dict"}
