{"content": "The error indicates that the target position for placing the offshore pump is too far from the player's current position. Let's resolve this by moving closer to the target position before attempting to place the offshore pump.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Move Closer to the Target Position:**\n   - Before placing the offshore pump, ensure the player is within the maximum allowable distance from the target position.\n\n2. **Re-attempt Placement:**\n   - Once in range, attempt to place the offshore pump again.\n\nHere's how you can implement these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Move closer to the water position\nmove_to(water_position)\n\n# Step 2: Attempt to place the offshore pump again\noffshore_pump = place_entity(Prototype.OffshorePump, Direction.UP, water_position)\nassert offshore_pump, \"Failed to place offshore pump after moving closer.\"\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n\n- **Check Inventory Before Crafting:**\n  - Always ensure you have the necessary materials before attempting to craft items. This avoids unnecessary errors and resource wastage.\n\n- **Use Assertions for Debugging:**\n  - Assertions help catch errors early by ensuring that expected conditions are met. Use them to validate assumptions, like successful crafting or placement of entities.\n\n- **Plan Entity Placement:**\n  - When placing entities, consider the layout and proximity to resources and other entities to ensure efficient operation and connectivity.\n\nBy following these steps and tips, you should be able to successfully place the offshore pump and continue setting up your power generation system.", "summary_range": "[1-146]"}
