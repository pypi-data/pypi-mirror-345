{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone brick production at position (-45.0, 3.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (-46.0, 0.0) mining stone\n- Stone furnace at (-45.0, 3.0) smelting stone bricks\n- Burner inserter at (-43.5, 3.5) moving bricks from furnace (currently waiting for source items)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Incorrect attribute access\n- Furnace objects don't have a `drop_position` attribute - use the furnace's position and calculate adjacent positions manually for placement\n\n#### Placement collision errors\n- Always check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- When placing next to existing entities, ensure sufficient spacing is provided (minimum 1 tile)\n- Remove blocking entities before attempting to place new ones in occupied positions\n\n#### Distance limitations for placement\n- Move within 10 tiles of target position before attempting to place entities\n- The player must be close enough to interact with entities (max distance = 10 tiles)\n\n#### Inserter placement issues\n- When placing inserters between machines, ensure:\n  - There's space for both pickup and drop positions\n  - No other entities block the inserter's operational area\n  - The inserter has fuel if it's a burner type\n\n#### Mining drill placement\n- Verify the target resource patch position is clear before placing drills\n- Ensure the player is close enough when placing mining drills on resources"}
