The agent repeatedly attempted to deploy a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) to support Automation Science Pack supply for research, but efforts to craft and place the Lab failed. Existing smelting structures (for example, the alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) used for iron plate production and the copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) used for copper plate production) were referenced during processing; however, none of these were built or altered in the current steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Errors for get_entities\n  - When invoking get_entities, avoid supplying unsupported parameters (such as the keyword 'radius' or extra positional arguments). Verify the function signature to ensure that only the correct parameters are used.\n\n\u2022 Handling None Results in Entity Retrieval\n  - Ensure that the value returned by get_entities is checked for None before iterating over it. Use a fallback (such as an empty list) to prevent TypeError when iterating.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures\n  - Confirm that the Lab entity is present in the inventory before attempting placement to avoid errors like \u201cNo lab in inventory.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Insufficiencies\n  - Before crafting a Lab, validate that all required sub-components (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available in sufficient quantities. Strengthen the resource supply chain to meet the detailed component requirements and prevent repeated crafting failures."}
