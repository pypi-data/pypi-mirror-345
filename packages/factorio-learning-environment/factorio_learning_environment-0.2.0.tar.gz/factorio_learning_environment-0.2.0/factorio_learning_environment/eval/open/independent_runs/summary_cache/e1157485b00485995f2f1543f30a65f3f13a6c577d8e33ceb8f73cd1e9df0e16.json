{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for transferring items between entities\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and Position (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions, including:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-35.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -112.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-37.5, -111.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-42.5, -109.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups at positions extending to (8.5, 30.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of an Electricity Group with poles at various positions, including:\n- Small Electric Poles from Position (-51.5, -117.5) to Position (5.5, -54.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the path for pipe connections is clear and not blocked by other entities or terrain. Adjust the layout to avoid placement blockage.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Type in API Usage\n- When using functions like `insert_item`, ensure that the second argument is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Double-check the function parameters to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities Without Required Items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like electric poles. Craft or acquire the required items beforehand to avoid connection failures."}
