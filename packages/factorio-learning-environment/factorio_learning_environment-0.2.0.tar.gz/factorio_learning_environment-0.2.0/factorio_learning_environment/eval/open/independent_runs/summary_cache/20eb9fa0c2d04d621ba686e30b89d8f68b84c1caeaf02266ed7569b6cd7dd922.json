{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(-8.0, -59.0)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row with wooden chests:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0) with chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0) with chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0) with chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are mining iron ore and outputting to their respective chests.\n\n### Copper Processing Line at position(-27.0, -59.0)\nA copper ore mining and smelting setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-28.5, -58.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving items to the chest\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at position(3.0, 0.0)\nFour parallel smelting columns, each consisting of:\n1. Input section:\n- Wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n\n2. Smelting section:\n- Stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n\n3. Output section:\n- Burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n\n### Additional Smelting Setup at position(-22.0, -58.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Burner inserters at (-22.5, -59.5) and (-20.5, -59.5)\n- Output inserter at (-22.5, -56.5)\n- Output chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones. The agent tried to place a burner inserter where a stone furnace already existed\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing to avoid collisions\n- Consider using different directions or increasing spacing when the default placement fails\n\n### Blocked Output Warnings\n- Several burner mining drills show \"output blocked\" warnings. Ensure there are appropriate output entities (like chests or belts) to receive the mined resources\n- Some furnace inserters show \"furnace belt blocked\" warnings. Make sure there is sufficient space in the output destination\n\n### Resource Management\n- Some furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings. Ensure proper input material flow to keep the production line running"}
