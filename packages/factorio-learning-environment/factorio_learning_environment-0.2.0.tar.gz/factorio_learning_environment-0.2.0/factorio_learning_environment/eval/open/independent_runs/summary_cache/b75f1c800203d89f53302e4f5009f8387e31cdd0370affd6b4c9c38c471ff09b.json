{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.0, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5) and another at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe groups connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engines\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt, currently holding 51 iron plates\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) with warnings of not receiving electricity\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple electric poles, including one at position (-13.5, 24.5) intended to connect the steam engine\n- Inserters attempting to connect to the electricity network but currently not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly connected from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engines to allow fluid flow. Reconnect any misplaced pipes.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connection\n- Verify that electric poles are correctly placed and connected to the steam engines to ensure the power network is established. Ensure that all entities requiring power are within the coverage area of electric poles.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Check the power network to ensure that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole. Ensure that the electric poles are connected to a functional power source.\n\n### Repeated Placement of Electric Poles\n- Avoid placing electric poles repeatedly at the same position unless necessary. Check existing connections before placing new poles.\n\n### Offshore Pump Not Connected\n- Ensure the offshore pump is connected to the fluid network to supply water to the boiler and steam engines."}
