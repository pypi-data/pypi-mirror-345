{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line at position(8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position(8.5, 13.5)\n- Input inserter for iron gears at position(8.5, 10.5)\n- Iron gear chest at position(7.5, 10.5) containing 4 iron gears\n- Output inserter at position(10.5, 13.5)\n- Output chest at position(11.5, 13.5)\n- Copper inserter at position(12.5, 13.5)\n- Transport belt system starting at position(8.5, 11.5) with 11 belts\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-4.5, 16.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 16.0) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 12.5)\n- Offshore pump at position(-3.5, 27.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting water and steam\n- Electric pole network with multiple poles\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at various positions:\n1. Setup at position(41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n2. Setup at position(-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest and inserter system\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n3. Setup at position(-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest and inserter system\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - multiple attempts to place inserters and chests where other entities already exist\n- When placing entities next to assembling machines, account for their 3x3 tile size\n- Consider the spacing parameter carefully when using place_entity_next_to function\n\n### Direction-based Placement Issues\n- When placing inserters and chests, ensure the chosen direction doesn't conflict with existing structures\n- Pay attention to the reference position and direction when placing entities near assembling machines\n\n### Structure Collision Issues\n- Consider the full dimensions of structures (especially assembling machines and furnaces) when placing nearby entities\n- Leave adequate space between different production lines to avoid placement conflicts\n\n### Power System Management\n- Ensure boilers are kept fueled for consistent power generation\n- Monitor power consumption and generation to maintain stable electricity supply"}
