Multiple attempts to place these entities failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors when Moving Entities\n- Verify the destination is valid and unoccupied before moving entities like Stone Furnaces. Several attempts to move Stone Furnaces failed due to invalid or occupied target positions.\n\n### Errors when Retrieving Entities\n- Confirm the existence of entities at the specified positions before retrieval. Attempts to get Stone Furnaces at specific positions failed because no entity was found.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Ensure the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. An attempt to insert coal into a drill failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status and warnings of entities to ensure they are functioning correctly and address any issues such as blocked outputs or lack of ingredients."}
