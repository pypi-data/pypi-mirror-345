{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n- Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n- Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with a warning of 'furnace result is full'.\n- Multiple chests for storage of iron plates and iron ore, including a full chest at position (-15.5, -49.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), and (4.5, -56.5) for storage of iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- A series of wooden chests and iron chests at various positions, including (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), and (-5.5, -50.5), used for the storage and transfer of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the output of the furnace is not full before supplying more ingredients. Regularly transfer the output to storage chests to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests at Drop Positions\n- Regularly empty the chests at drop positions to ensure that mining drills can continue to operate without interruption.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore`: int, represents the quantity of iron ore in various chests.\n  - `iron_plate`: int, represents the quantity of iron plates in various chests.\n  - `wooden_chest`: int, represents the number of wooden chests available.\n  - `iron_gear_wheel`: int, represents the quantity of iron gear wheels in the inventory."}
