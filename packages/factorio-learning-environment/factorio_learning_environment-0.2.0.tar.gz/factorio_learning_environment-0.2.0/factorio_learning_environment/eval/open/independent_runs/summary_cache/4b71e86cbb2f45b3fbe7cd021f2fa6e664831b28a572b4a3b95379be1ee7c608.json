Check the area for any obstructions.\n- Verify that there is a pipe available in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n- Confirm that the positions selected for connecting pipes are suitable and that the pipes can be connected without overlapping water or other entities.\n\n### Errors with Entity Status\n- For the steam engine and boiler, ensure they are properly connected to the offshore pump and each other to function correctly.\n- Check that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate.\n- Ensure that the electricity group is properly plugged into the electric network to function.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be significantly improved."}
