{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0), extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5), storing extracted coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0), processing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5), transferring coal from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal when none is available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with insufficient spacing or direction\n- When placing entities like inserters, ensure there is enough space and the correct direction is set. Adjust the spacing or direction if placement fails due to collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile for placing an entity is unoccupied. Adjust the position or remove conflicting entities before placement."}
