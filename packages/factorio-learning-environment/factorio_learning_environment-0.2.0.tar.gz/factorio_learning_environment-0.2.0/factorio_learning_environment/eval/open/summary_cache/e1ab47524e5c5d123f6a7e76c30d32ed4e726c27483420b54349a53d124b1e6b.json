{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a small iron plate smelting structure:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), facing down, extracting iron ore from the nearby iron ore patch.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0), used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5), placed to collect iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5), facing down, transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5), facing right, moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n\nThis setup is designed to automate the mining and smelting of iron ore into iron plates, with fuel (coal) inserted into the drill, furnace, and inserters to keep them operational.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters adjacent to occupied tiles\n- When placing an inserter next to another entity (e.g., furnace), ensure the target tile is not already occupied by another entity such as a chest.\n- To avoid placement conflicts, increase spacing, change the direction of placement, or adjust the reference position for the inserter placement.\n\n### Errors caused by lack of fuel in entities\n- Entities such as burner mining drills, furnaces, and burner inserters require fuel to operate.\n- Always ensure coal or other fuel is inserted into these entities to keep them working; otherwise, they will show statuses like NO_FUEL or WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS.\n\n### Errors extracting from empty or invalid resource positions\n- Attempting to extract resources from positions without valid resource entities results in failure.\n- Confirm the mining drill is placed correctly over a resource patch and that the drop position for extraction is valid.\n\n### Errors placing entities not present in inventory\n- Trying to place an entity (e.g., iron chest) that is not available in the inventory will cause placement failure.\n- Verify the inventory contains the required item before attempting to place it.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent so far."}
