{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to extract iron ore and smelt it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates potential misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly check the chest inventory to ensure it is not full, which can halt the mining operation. Empty the chest when necessary to continue mining.\n\n### Errors with Extracting Iron Ore\n- Verify that the quantity of iron ore to be extracted from the chest is greater than zero to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Confirm that the inserter is functioning properly and that there are no obstructions preventing iron ore from being transferred to the furnace. Adjust the inserter setup as needed to ensure a continuous supply of iron ore to the furnace.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly refuel the mining drill and inserter with coal to maintain continuous operation and prevent downtime."}
