{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Stone furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled by coal, with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5).\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), and other nearby positions for storing mined resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting. For example, the burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5) is full.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Smelting Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to smelt. The stone furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) have warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal harvested and used as fuel.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron plates produced and stored."}
