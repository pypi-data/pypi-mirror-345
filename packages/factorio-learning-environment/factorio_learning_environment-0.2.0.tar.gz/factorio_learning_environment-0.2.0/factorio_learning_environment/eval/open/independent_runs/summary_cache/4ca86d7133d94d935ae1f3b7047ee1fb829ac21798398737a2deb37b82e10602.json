{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and currently working to produce iron plates from iron ore.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The drill is currently waiting for space in the destination, indicating a blockage in output.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (200.5, -80.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Adjusting Transport Belt Connections\n- Ensure that the path for transport belts is clear and that there is enough space to place belts between the intended start and end positions. Check for obstructions or occupied tiles that might prevent belt placement.\n\n### Errors when Placing Burner Inserters\n- Verify that the intended placement position for burner inserters is unoccupied and suitable for the inserter. Ensure there is no obstruction or another entity occupying the space.\n\n### Errors when Placing Wooden Chests\n- Before placing a wooden chest, make sure the intended tile is free from other entities or obstacles. Confirm that the placement position is valid and accessible.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drill\n- Address the warning of \"output blocked by item on the ground\" by ensuring there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the mining drill."}
