{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and an empty source inventory, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with no fuel and containing iron ore in the source inventory, currently not smelting due to being out of fuel.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and an empty source inventory, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0), out of fuel, with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5) and a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5), full of iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions ranging from (5.5, -60.5) to (9.5, -60.5), mostly empty.\n- Several Wooden Chests at positions ranging from (-14.5, -50.5) to (-7.5, -50.5), some containing iron plates and others full, indicating storage for iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting iron plates from stone furnaces\n- Ensure that the stone furnace contains the specified quantity of iron plates before attempting to extract. Check the furnace's inventory status to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when extracting iron ore from a chest\n- Verify that the chest contains iron ore before attempting extraction. Regularly check the inventory of the chest to ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Errors due to full chests at mining drill drop positions\n- Regularly clear out or expand storage at the drop position of mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces being out of fuel\n- Ensure that all stone furnaces have adequate fuel to continue smelting operations. Regularly replenish fuel supplies to avoid production stoppages.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from an entity. Ensure the entity contains the required item and quantity to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_plates`: Stores the result of iron plate extraction operations.\n- `furnace`: Represents the stone furnace entity from which items are being extracted."}
