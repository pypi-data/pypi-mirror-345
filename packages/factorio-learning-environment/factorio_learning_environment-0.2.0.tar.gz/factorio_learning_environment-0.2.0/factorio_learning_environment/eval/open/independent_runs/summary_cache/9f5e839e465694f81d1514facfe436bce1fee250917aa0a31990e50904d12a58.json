{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Smelting Setup at position (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace placed at (-13.0, -50.0) which was used for smelting operations by accepting coal and iron ore to produce iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup with Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill positioned at (-14.0, -50.0) for mining iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5) positioned to collect ore delivered from the drill\n\nERROR TIPS\n- When placing an entity, verify that the required item exists in the inventory. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one led to a placement failure.\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available for smelting before initiating the process. Inadequate ingredients resulted in smelting timeouts.\n- Confirm inventory contents prior to inserting items into machines. Absence of expected items (such as iron ore) triggered insertion errors."}
