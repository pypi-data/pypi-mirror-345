The agent made several attempts to establish a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for research support, but all placement and crafting operations failed because of inventory shortages and missing sub-ingredients. Although processing units such as furnaces were identified and used for smelting (an iron smelting furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper smelting furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)), these were only referenced for resource conversion and were not newly created or permanently placed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Invocation Errors \u2013 When using get_entities:\n  - Verify the function signature and use only the supported arguments. Avoid including unexpected keywords (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures:\n  - Confirm that the required Lab entity is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  - Ensure that all necessary sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, and copper-plates) are available to support Lab crafting.\n\n\u2022 Collection Iteration Issues:\n  - Validate that any collection (e.g. those returned by utility calls) is not None before iterating. Fallback to an empty list if the returned value is None.\n\n\u2022 Resource Dependency Management:\n  - Prior to triggering crafting or placement routines, check that upstream processes (such as smelting for iron or copper) yield sufficient outputs to meet subsequent part requirements."}
