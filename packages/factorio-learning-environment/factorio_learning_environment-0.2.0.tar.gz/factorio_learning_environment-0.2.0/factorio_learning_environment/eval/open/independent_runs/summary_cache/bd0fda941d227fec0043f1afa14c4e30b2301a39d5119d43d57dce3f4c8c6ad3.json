{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n- Two Stone Furnaces:\n  - Furnace 1 at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Furnace 2 at position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- Two Burner Inserters:\n  - Inserter 1 at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n  - Inserter 2 at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Three Wooden Chests:\n  - Chest 1 at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n  - Chest 2 at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5)\n  - Chest 3 at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting the chests and inserters:\n  - Belt from (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5)\n\nThis facility is designed to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates using the furnaces, and transport materials using inserters and belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. Check the inventory of the connected entities to confirm that they contain the necessary items.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the mining drills to prevent them from stopping. Monitor the fuel levels and ensure a steady supply of coal or other fuel sources.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Supply the furnaces with the necessary raw materials to keep them operational. Check the inventory of the furnaces to ensure they have the required ingredients for smelting."}
