Validate and select a working PipeGroup\u2014such as the one with fluid_system=11460\u2014before initiating further connection attempts.\n\n\u2022 Redundant Pipeline Stabilization Delays:\n  - Repeated 10-second wait periods after each failed connection attempt incur unnecessary delays. Streamline the stabilization check process to reduce time loss.\n\n\u2022 Persistent Water Supply Connection Failure:\n  - Despite several connection attempts, the steam engine remains NOT_CONNECTED. Reassess the integration between the boiler, offshore pump, and pipeline network to ensure proper fluid delivery."}
