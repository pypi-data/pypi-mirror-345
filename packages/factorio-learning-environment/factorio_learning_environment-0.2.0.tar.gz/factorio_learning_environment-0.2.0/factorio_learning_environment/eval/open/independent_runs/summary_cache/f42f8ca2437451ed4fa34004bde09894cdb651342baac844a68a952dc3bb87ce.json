{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-4.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 16.0) with coal fuel\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups for water and steam circulation\n- Electric pole network connecting power to other structures\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line at (8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at (8.5, 13.5)\n- Output inserter at (10.5, 13.5) and output chest at (11.5, 13.5)\n- Copper input inserter at (8.5, 9.5) with copper chest at (8.5, 8.5)\n- Stone furnace at (14.0, 14.0)\n- Transport belt system with 11 belts running from (8.5, 11.5) to (1.5, 16.5)\n\n### Mining and Smelting Outposts\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at:\n1. Position (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n2. Position (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest and inserter system\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n3. Position (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest and inserter system\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Consider different directions or increased spacing when placing entities near transport belts\n- Pay attention to entity dimensions when placing larger structures like furnaces\n\n### Direction Related Errors\n- Use only valid direction constants (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- NORTHWEST is not a valid direction in the game\n\n### Resource and Power Issues\n- Ensure burner mining drills have fuel\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner inserters and furnaces\n- Keep power system (boiler) fueled for consistent electricity generation\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- Verify all components are properly connected and aligned\n- Ensure proper spacing between inserters and their target entities\n- Consider the flow direction when setting up belt and inserter systems\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor chest inventories to ensure proper resource flow\n- Verify input materials are available for assembling machines\n- Keep track of fuel distribution across burner entities"}
