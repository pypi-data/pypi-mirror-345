"""
This section contains all the core methods of the classes which are redefined or called within the type definition.
It is intended to be class-specific methods, not related to class integration definitions. This section should follow the
same structure of the type definitions file system.

The goal by doing this is to maximize functionality of the types, but separate code modularity.
This section should only contain class-specific class-methods broken into individual functionality that can be extended.
It should not contain operations on classes that do not return the same class or a subset of that class.

This section is meant to be used for internal use only as it corresponds to hidden class-methods. None of these functions
can be used any type definitions accordingly.
