{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-16.5, y=-69.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- Wooden Chests for storage at various positions.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) processing iron ore into copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- Wooden Chests for storage at various positions.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests for storage at various positions.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source to confirm availability.\n\n### Furnace Fuel Source is Full\n- Regularly check the output of the furnaces to ensure they are not full, which can halt production. Consider adding more storage or processing the output more frequently.\n\n### Chest is Full\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can block inserters and halt production lines."}
