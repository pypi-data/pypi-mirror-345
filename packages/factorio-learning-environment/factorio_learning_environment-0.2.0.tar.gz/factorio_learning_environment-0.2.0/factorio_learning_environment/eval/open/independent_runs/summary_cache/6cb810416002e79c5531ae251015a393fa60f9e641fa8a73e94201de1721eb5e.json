{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-20, -70)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23, -68) connected to a transport belt network\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20, -70) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18, -70) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the furnaces\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (-14, -53)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14, -53) connected to a transport belt network\n- Stone Furnace at position (0, 0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) currently empty\n- Various BeltGroups connecting different parts of the map, ensuring material flow\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Connections\n- Ensure there are no gaps between transport belts when connecting them. A gap was detected at position (-12.5, -55.5), which was later fixed by placing a transport belt at this position.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check the alignment and supply of source items for inserters. Inserters at positions (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) are waiting for source items, indicating a possible misalignment or lack of supply.\n\n### AttributeError in Code\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup objects have the necessary attributes before accessing them. An error occurred due to the absence of the 'direction' attribute in a BeltGroup object."}
