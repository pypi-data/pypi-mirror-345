{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone brick production at position (-50.0, 0.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (-50.0, 0.0) facing RIGHT mining stone\n- Stone furnace at (-45.0, 0.0) smelting stone bricks\n- Burner inserter at (-47.5, 0.5) moving stone from belts to furnace\n- Transport belt at (-48.5, 0.5) carrying stone from drill to inserter\n- Output system added:\n  - Burner inserter at (-49.5, 3.5) moving bricks to chest\n  - Wooden chest at (-49.5, 4.5) for brick storage\n\n#### New stone brick production line at position (20.0, 11.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 11.0) facing DOWN mining coal\n- Stone furnace at (22.0, 11.0) for smelting\n- Burner inserter at (20.5, 12.5) moving items\n- Wooden chest at (22.5, 13.5) for output storage\n\nCurrent status:\n- Original line still non-functional due to input/output issues\n- New line has drill operational but output blocked\n- Furnace in new line has no ingredients\n- Both systems showing warnings about blocked outputs and missing inputs\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent placement errors\n- Repeated failures placing inserters at (-50.0, 1.0), (17.5, -0.5), (18.0, 0.0)\n- Causes:\n  - Water tiles or existing entities blocking placement\n  - Attempting placements while too far away (distance >10)\n- Solutions:\n  - Always verify placement positions with can_place_entity()\n  - Move character within 10 tiles before placement\n  - Maintain spatial awareness of water/obstacles\n\n#### Mining drill placement issues\n- Failed placements at (0.0, 0.0) and (23.0, 11.0)\n- Critical fixes:\n  - Avoid water-heavy areas for mining operations\n  - Use smaller building boxes when searching locations\n  - Verify resource patches before drill placement\n\n#### Entity interaction failures\n- Attempting to get non-existent drill at (18.0, -1.0)\n- Must:\n  - Verify entity existence before interaction\n  - Implement error handling for missing entities\n  - Maintain accurate entity position tracking\n\n#### Production chain issues\n- Both production lines non-functional due to:\n  - Blocked drill outputs\n  - Missing input materials\n  - Improper inserter configurations\n- Required actions:\n  - Clear all output blockages\n  - Verify complete material flow paths\n  - Check inserter directions and positions\n\n#### Throughput optimization\n- Current production: 0 bricks, 10-21 coal/60s\n- Bottlenecks:\n  - Incomplete production chains\n  - Fuel supply inconsistencies\n  - Entity positioning problems\n- Improvement path:\n  - Complete at least one functional production line\n  - Implement proper fuel supply systems\n  - Optimize entity spacing and orientations\n\n#### Repetitive error patterns\n- Same placement errors occurring multiple times\n- Need to:\n  - Implement placement validation routines\n  - Break retry loops with condition checks\n  - Develop spatial planning system\n\n#### Building box sizing issues\n- Failed to find placement for large building box\n- Solution:\n  - Use smaller building boxes\n  - Implement tiled placement approach\n  - Verify terrain suitability before placement"}
