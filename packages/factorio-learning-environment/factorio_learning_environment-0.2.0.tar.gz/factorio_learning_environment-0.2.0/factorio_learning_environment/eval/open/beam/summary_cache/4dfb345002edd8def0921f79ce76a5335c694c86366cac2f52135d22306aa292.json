This can be done using a transport belt or by placing the chest in the correct position to receive items directly.\n2. **Insert Wood into the Stone Furnace** to ensure it continues smelting Iron Ore into Iron Plates.\n3. **Monitor the production of Iron Plates** and ensure that the Iron Chest collects them effectively.\n\nLet's proceed with connecting the output of the Burner Mining Drill to the Iron Chest.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Step 1: Place a transport belt to connect the output of the Burner Mining Drill to the Iron Chest\n# Assuming we need to place a belt from the drill to the chest\nplace_entity(Prototype.TransportBelt, position=Position(x=-15.5, y=25.0))  # Place the belt towards the chest\n\n# Step 2: Insert Wood into the Stone Furnace to keep it operational\nif inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Wood, 0) > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Wood, furnace_entity, quantity=min(5, inspect_inventory()[Prototype.Wood]))\n\n# Step 3: Check the updated status of the entities after placing the belt and refueling the Furnace\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after placing the transport belt: {get_entities()}\")\nprint(f\"Stone Furnace current status after refueling: {inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)}\")", "summary_range": "[1-198]"}
