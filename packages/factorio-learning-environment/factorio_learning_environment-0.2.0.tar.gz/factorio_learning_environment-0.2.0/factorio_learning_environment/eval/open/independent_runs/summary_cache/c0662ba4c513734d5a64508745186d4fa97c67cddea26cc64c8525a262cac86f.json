{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5), responsible for inserting items into the furnace, currently out of fuel.\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of items within the processing facility.\n\n### Coal Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -53.5), responsible for moving coal, currently out of fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -52.5), responsible for moving coal, currently out of fuel.\n- BeltGroup facilitating the movement of coal between different positions, consisting of multiple belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing wooden chests\n- Ensure there is a suitable and unoccupied position before attempting to place a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a stone furnace\n- Use an inserter to connect belts from a stone furnace, as belts cannot be connected directly.\n\n### Insufficient coal for refueling\n- Monitor coal inventory levels and ensure adequate coal supply to refuel all necessary inserters and furnaces.\n\n### Issues with iron plate production\n- Investigate the stone furnace setup to ensure it has the necessary ingredients to produce iron plates."}
