defaults:
  - sampler: tpe
  # necessary to avoid an interpolation error during config composition
  - /search_space@hydra.sweeper.params: none
  - _self_
  # override sweeper to Optuna!
  - override /hydra/sweeper: optuna

###
#  - this config uses the optuna sweeper plugin of hydra
#  - the considered hyperparameters are given by the search_space config
#  - will sequentially run hpo.trials many experiments and sample hps according to hpo/sampler
#  - default sampler is tpe (https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/samplers/generated/optuna.samplers.TPESampler.html)
#  - other samplers are ``hpo/sampler=random`` (https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/samplers/generated/optuna.samplers.RandomSampler.html) and ``hpo/sampler=grid`` (https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/samplers/generated/optuna.samplers.GridSampler.html)
#  - example: ``mml train proj=test search_space=example hpo/sampler=grid --multirun``
#  - more details can be found in `hydra's optuna sweeper documentation <https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/optuna_sweeper/>`_
hpo:
  ###
  # default: null
  #  - the optuna storage to use, if null only a temporary in-memory storage will be created
  #  - see mml-sql for details on how to set up permanent storage
  storage: null
  ###
  # default: minimize
  #  - direction of optimization, either minimize or maximize
  #  - must be set according to the kind of return value by the respective scheduler
  direction: minimize
  ###
  # default: False
  #  - currently unused, intended for future pruning of hopeless runs
  #  - see https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra/issues/1954
  pruning: false
  ###
  # default: 100
  #  - number of trials, each trial is one mml call with (potentially) different sampled hyperparameters
  trials: 100

  # here we define Optuna hyperparameter search
