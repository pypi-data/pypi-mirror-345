{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15, -50) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14, -48) smelting iron plates\nCurrently working but output is blocked\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (4, 4)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (4, 4) with 30 copper plates in output\n- Stone furnace at (6, 4) with 6 copper plates in output\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2, 23.5) \n- Steam engine at (9.5, 19.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the components\n- Small electric poles providing power distribution\nSystem is operational with water flowing but boiler needs fuel\n\n### Research Lab at (0.5, 8.5)\n- Lab with 7 automation science packs loaded\n- Connected to power network but currently has no power\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Check if required items are in inventory before attempting to place or insert them\n- Common items missing: coal for fuel, ore for furnaces\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure you have crafted the required entity before trying to place it\n- Examples: Offshore pump, boiler placement failed due to missing items\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Errors\n- Some items cannot be crafted directly and require specific buildings:\n  - Copper/Iron plates require furnaces\n  - Electronic circuits require assembling machines\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered, not crafted\n\n### Building Connection Errors\n- Ensure you have required connection items (like pipes) in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Power network requires electric poles to be properly placed and connected\n\n### Type Operation Errors\n- Building dimensions should be accessed directly, not through ModelPrivateAttr\n- Example: Using Prototype.Boiler.WIDTH directly caused type error\n\n### Resource Access Errors\n- Move close enough to resources before attempting to extract\n- Ensure output of mining drills and furnaces isn't blocked"}
