{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Location:** Position(x=53.0, y=-83.0)\n- **Components:**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position(x=52.5, y=-84.5)\n  - The chest stores coal with a capacity of 320 units.\n\n### Copper and Iron Ore Mining Facility\n- **Location:** Position(x=-25.0, y=-64.0)\n- **Components:**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=-25.0, y=-64.0) connected to a transport belt system.\n  - Transport Belt Group connecting Position(x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to Position(x=-22.5, y=-65.5) and Position(x=-20.5, y=-66.5).\n  - Resources include copper ore and iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Location:** Position(x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\n- **Components:**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position(x=-14.5, y=-54.5)\n  - The chest stores iron ore with a capacity of 291 units.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Location:** Position(x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- **Components:**\n  - Stone Furnace at Position(x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel.\n  - Furnace outputting iron plates with a current total of 84 units.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position(x=1.5, y=0.5) connected via a Burner Inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Additional Transport Belt Systems\n- **Locations:**\n  - BeltGroup from Position(x=-14.5, y=-54.5) to Position(x=-17.5, y=-59.5) with 7 belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters\n- Ensure there is a suitable position available for placing the inserter. Check for obstructions or occupied tiles before attempting to place an inserter.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Keep track of the fuel status of burner mining drills and ensure they are refueled regularly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply the required resources to prevent production halts."}
