{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). The drill is currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at the drop position.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing 403 units of iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests positioned at (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) each containing 183 iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) containing 1476 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore and Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-4.5, -52.5) and (-5.5, -52.5) containing 400 iron plates and 232 iron ore, respectively.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-2.5, -52.5) containing 200 iron ore.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing 326 iron ore and 1500 iron plates.\n\n### Furnace Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with warnings of being out of fuel and a full furnace result inventory.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt and a full furnace result inventory.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from a chest\n- Ensure that the chest is not full before attempting to extract items. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing extraction.\n\n### Errors due to out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like burner mining drills and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) is out of fuel.\n\n### Errors due to full inventories\n- Regularly empty the output inventories of entities like furnaces to prevent operation halts. The stone furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0) and (-13.0, -48.0) have full result inventories.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] = {'wooden-chest': 2, 'coal': 55, 'iron-plate': 7569, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}"}
