{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) supplied with iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) supplied with iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) supplied with iron ore\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items from a Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) to another Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Additional Entities\n- Lab with no research in progress\n- Multiple PipeGroups with varying statuses and positions\n- Electricity network with poles and no active connections\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between entities. Check the positions and ensure there are no obstructions or incorrect placements.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to the power network and has input liquid. Ensure that the pipe network is complete and functional.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the power connections to ensure that the inserter is connected to a power source. Ensure that the electricity network is complete and functioning.\n\n### Mining Drill Output Blocked\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to prevent mining interruptions."}
