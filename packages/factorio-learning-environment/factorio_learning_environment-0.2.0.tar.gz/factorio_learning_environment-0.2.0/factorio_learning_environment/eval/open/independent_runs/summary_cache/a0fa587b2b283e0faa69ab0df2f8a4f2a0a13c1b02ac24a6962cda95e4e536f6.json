{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which processes copper ore and iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0) which extracts copper ore.\n\n### Coal Storage at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) which stores coal.\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that transfers coal from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that waits for space in the destination.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which stores iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient fuel\n- Ensure that burner-mining-drills have enough fuel to operate. Check and refill with coal or other fuel sources as necessary.\n\n### Errors when the stone furnace is full\n- When the stone furnace indicates FULL_OUTPUT, ensure to either remove the output or provide a way to use the output to avoid halting production.\n\n### Errors when crafting due to insufficient materials\n- Ensure you have enough Copper Plates before attempting to craft an Assembling Machine. Gather more copper ore and process it into plates as needed.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for items\n- Check the source and destination of inserters to ensure they are properly connected and that there are items available to transfer.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check the status of the tile and surrounding entities.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int\n- `copper-ore`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `burner-mining-drill`: EntityStatus\n- `stone-furnace`: EntityStatus\n- `burner-inserter`: EntityStatus\n- `wooden-chest`: EntityStatus"}
