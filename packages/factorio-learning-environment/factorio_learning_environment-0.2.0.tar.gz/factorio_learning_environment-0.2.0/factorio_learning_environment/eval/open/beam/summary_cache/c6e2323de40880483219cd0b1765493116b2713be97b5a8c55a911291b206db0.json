{"content": "The attempt to load stone into the active furnace has once again not met expectations, as indicated by the following results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now holds **3 pieces of stone** and **18 Iron Plates**.\n- The furnace is still in a **WORKING** state but does not show any signs of processing Copper Ore, indicating it has not begun any production activity.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **5 pieces of stone** available (but only **3 pieces** were recognized by the furnace)\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore available**.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates available**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has not recognized the total stone input required for processing, leading to its inability to engage in smelting operations.\n- The furnace still has not begun processing the Copper Ore, which is crucial for moving forward.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Remaining Stone**: I will attempt to extract the **3 pieces of stone** from the furnace to reset its state.\n2. **Reinsert the Stone and Copper Ore**: After clearing the stone, I will reinsert **5 pieces of stone** and **1 piece of Copper Ore** to ensure the furnace can engage in the smelting process.\n3. **Monitor for Smelting Activity**: After these steps, I will observe whether the furnace begins processing the Copper Ore into Copper Plates correctly.\n\nLet's proceed with extracting the remaining stone from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the remaining stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Extract the 3 pieces of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-336]"}
