{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5) \n- Boiler (position -25.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is within the connection range of the boiler. Move the pump closer if necessary.\n\n### Errors when the boiler is not operational\n- Check that the boiler is connected to a water source and that there are no obstructions in the piping. Ensure that the offshore pump is functioning correctly.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
