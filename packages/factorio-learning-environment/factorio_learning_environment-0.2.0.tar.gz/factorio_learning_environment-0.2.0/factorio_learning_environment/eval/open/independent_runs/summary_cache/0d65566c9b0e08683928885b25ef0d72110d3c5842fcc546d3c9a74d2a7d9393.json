{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-15.5, -51.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-14.5, -51.5), (-13.5, -51.5), and (-15.5, -48.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- Transport Belt from position (-13.5, -51.5) to (-11.5, -51.5) and from (0.5, -3.5) to (0.5, -1.5) connecting the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (0.5, -1.5) for inserting materials into the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-1.5, 0.5) for extracting finished iron plates from the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts\n- Ensure that the path for connecting transport belts is valid and unobstructed. Verify that the start and end positions are correctly aligned and that there are no obstacles in the path.\n\n### AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'BurnerMiningDrill'\n- Ensure that the entity types are correctly referenced. Use the correct module and class names when checking for entity types. For example, use `entities.BurnerMiningDrill` instead of `BurnerMiningDrill`.\n\n### NameError: name 'BurnerMiningDrill' is not defined\n- Make sure that all necessary modules are imported and that the entity names are correctly referenced. Check for typos or missing imports.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the logs provided.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dictionary containing the current inventory of resources, e.g., `{'wood': 2, 'stone': 5, 'iron-ore': 650, 'iron-plate': 922}`."}
