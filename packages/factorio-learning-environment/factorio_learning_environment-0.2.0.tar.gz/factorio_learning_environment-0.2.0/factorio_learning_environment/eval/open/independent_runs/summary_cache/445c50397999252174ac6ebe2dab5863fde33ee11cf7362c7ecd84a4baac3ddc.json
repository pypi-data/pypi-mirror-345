{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=52.5, y=-84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and Furnace at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0), both with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a transport belt system leading to the chest.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) and Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-20.5, y=-63.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a transport belt system leading to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with full output of iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Belt Systems\nConsists of multiple belt groups connecting various entities across the map, facilitating the movement of resources between mining drills, furnaces, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Non-Game Entities\n- Avoid attempting to interact with non-game entities such as 'character'. These entities are not part of the game mechanics and should be skipped.\n\n### KeyError: 'character'\n- Ensure that the entity being referenced exists within the game context. The 'character' entity is not recognized and should be excluded from operations.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. This can be achieved by checking the inventory of the connected entities and ensuring they are not empty.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. This involves supplying the correct raw materials to the furnace for processing.\n\n### Furnace Full Output\n- Regularly clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from halting production due to full output. This can be done by ensuring there is a continuous flow of items out of the furnace."}
