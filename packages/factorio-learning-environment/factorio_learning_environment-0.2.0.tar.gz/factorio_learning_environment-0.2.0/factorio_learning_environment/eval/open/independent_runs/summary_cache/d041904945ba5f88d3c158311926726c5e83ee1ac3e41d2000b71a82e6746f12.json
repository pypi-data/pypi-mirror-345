{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), refueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), producing iron plates. Currently full with 100 iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), producing iron plates. Currently has 81 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron ore from a chest to the furnaces.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), waiting for source items to transfer iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), used for storing produced iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n\n### Errors related to accessing uninitialized variables\n- Always initialize variables before using them in operations to avoid `UnboundLocalError`.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect argument types\n- Verify that the correct type of object is passed to functions, such as ensuring an Entity or Position object is used where required, to avoid `ValueError`.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that there is a continuous supply of source items for inserters to avoid them being idle.\n\n### Furnace output full\n- Regularly clear the furnace output to prevent production halts due to full output slots.\n\n### Inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to receive items from the inserter to maintain efficient operations."}
