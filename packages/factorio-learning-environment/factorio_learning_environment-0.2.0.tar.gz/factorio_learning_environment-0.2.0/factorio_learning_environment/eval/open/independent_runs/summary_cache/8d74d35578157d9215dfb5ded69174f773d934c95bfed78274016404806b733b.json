{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, currently not receiving ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure the player is within a 10-tile radius of the target position when placing entities. Move closer to the target area before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or unsuitable tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Functionality Issues\n- Double-check the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Verify that the inserter is properly fueled and oriented to pick up and drop items as intended.\n\n### Fuel Management for Entities\n- Regularly refuel entities such as inserters, furnaces, and mining drills to maintain continuous operation. Keep a sufficient supply of coal or other fuels in the inventory to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Inventory and Resource Management\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests and furnaces to prevent overflow or shortages. Ensure that chests have enough space to store incoming resources and that furnaces receive the necessary ingredients for processing."}
