The recipe requires 1 iron plate per iron gear wheel, and you need a crafting machine or furnace to produce iron plates.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., furnace) has available space before attempting to insert items. The error indicates that the inventory is full, which prevents the insertion of additional items.\n\n### Repeated errors during the same steps\n- The errors related to crafting iron gear wheels and inserting iron plates into the furnace occurred multiple times. Review the inventory management to avoid running out of necessary items and ensure the target entities can accept the items being inserted."}
