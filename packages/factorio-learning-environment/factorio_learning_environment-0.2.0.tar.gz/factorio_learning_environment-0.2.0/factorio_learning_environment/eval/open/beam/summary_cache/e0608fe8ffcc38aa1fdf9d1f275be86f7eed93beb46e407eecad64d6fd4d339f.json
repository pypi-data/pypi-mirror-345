{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe latest operations have resulted in a couple of issues:\n\n### Issues Encountered:\n1. **Final Furnace Inventory After Waiting**: The furnace only contains **1 Copper Plate**, indicating that the remaining **Copper Ore** has not been processed, and it appears there may still be **1 Copper Ore** left in the furnace.\n2. **Coal Insertion Error**: The attempt to insert **Coal** into the furnace has failed because there is no Coal available in the inventory.\n\n### Current Inventory Status:\n- **Copper Plates**: 1 (after extraction)\n- **Copper Ore**: 1 (still in the furnace)\n- **Iron Ore**: 15\n- **Iron Plates**: 1\n- **Iron Gear Wheels**: 10\n- **Coal**: 0 (not available)\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Process Remaining Copper Ore**: I need to ensure that the remaining Copper Ore is smelted into Copper Plates. \n2. **Acquire Coal**: Since there is no Coal available, I will need to gather some from another source before I can proceed with loading Iron Ore into the furnace.\n\nLet\u2019s first check the status of the furnace to see if I can wait for the Copper Ore to smelt, and then I will plan to gather Coal. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for the remaining Copper Ore in the furnace to be smelted into Copper Plates\nwait_time = 30  # Maximum wait time in seconds \nfor _ in range(wait_time):\n    # Check how many Copper Plates have been produced after the extraction\n    furnace_inventory_status_after_wait = inspect_inventory(selected_furnace)\n    copper_plates_produced = furnace_inventory_status_after_wait.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\n    \n    if copper_plates_produced > 1:  # Looking for an increase in Copper Plates\n        print(f\"Produced Copper Plates: {copper_plates_produced}\")  # Indicate Copper Plates are ready\n        break\n    \n    sleep(1)  # Sleep for a second before checking again\n\n# Finally, check the inventory status again\nfinal_furnace_inventory_after_waiting = inspect_inventory(selected_furnace)\nprint(f\"Final Furnace Inventory After Waiting: {final_furnace_inventory_after_waiting}\")  # Display updated furnace inventory. \n\n# Check if Copper Ore has been processed\nif final_furnace_inventory_after_waiting.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0) == 0:  # Ensure no Copper Ore is left if processing is complete\n    # Since there is no Coal available, I need to gather some before I can proceed to load Iron Ore.\n    print(\"Need to gather Coal before proceeding to load Iron Ore.\")  # Notify the user about the need for Coal.\nelse:\n    print(\"Copper Ore is still present in the furnace, waiting for it to smelt.\")  # Notify about the ongoing process.\n\n# Final check of overall inventory state\nprint(f\"Overall Inventory State: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Display final overall inventory state.", "summary_range": "[1-460]"}
