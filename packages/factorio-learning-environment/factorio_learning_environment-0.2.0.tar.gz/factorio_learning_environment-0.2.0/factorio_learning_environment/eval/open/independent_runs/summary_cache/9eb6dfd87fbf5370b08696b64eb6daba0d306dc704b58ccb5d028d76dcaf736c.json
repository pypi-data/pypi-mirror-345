For example, the error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates that the agent tried to insert coal without having any in the inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item is available in the inventory before calling this function.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `mining_drill`: Represents the burner mining drill entity.\n  - `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory of the agent, including items like wood, coal, stone, iron ore, and iron plates."}
