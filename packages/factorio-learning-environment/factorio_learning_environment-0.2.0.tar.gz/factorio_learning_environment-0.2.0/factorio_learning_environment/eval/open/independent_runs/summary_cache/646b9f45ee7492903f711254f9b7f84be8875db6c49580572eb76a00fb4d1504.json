{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), (49.5, -80.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5), (41.5, -78.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), (-13.5, -49.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), (-9.5, -49.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-11.5, -49.5), (-10.5, -49.5), (-8.5, -49.5), (-7.5, -48.5)\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), (-8.5, -44.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have sufficient items in your inventory before attempting to supply resources to furnaces or other entities. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors When Chests Are Full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are at drop positions of mining drills to avoid warnings like \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest to continue mining.\"\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process, as indicated by warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\" Regularly supply the required resources to maintain production efficiency."}
