{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel and currently extracting iron ore from the wooden chest located at (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing 662 iron ore. This chest serves as the drop-off point for the iron ore extracted by the burner mining drill.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently not processing any materials due to a lack of ingredients. It has coal as fuel but is unable to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing 661 iron ore and 100 iron plates. This chest can serve as a storage for processed iron plates and additional iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when trying to extract from the Stone Furnace**\n  - Ensure that the Stone Furnace has iron plates available before attempting to extract. Check the inventory of the furnace to confirm the presence of items.\n\n- **Errors related to full chests**\n  - The burner mining drill is unable to continue mining because the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Regularly check and empty chests to ensure they do not reach full capacity, allowing for continuous operation of mining drills.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - None defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `iron_ore`: int (total count of iron ore in inventory)\n  - `iron_plate`: int (total count of iron plates in inventory)\n  - `coal`: int (total count of coal in inventory)\n  - `wood`: int (total count of wood in inventory)"}
