{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5): Used for storing items.\n\n#### Furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0): Used for smelting ores into plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n#### Transport Belt at position (41.5, -82.5) to (41.5, -80.5)\n- **Transport Belt** running from (41.5, -82.5) to (41.5, -80.5): Used for transporting items between structures.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before placing entities like transport belts or burner mining drills. Repeated attempts to place entities on occupied tiles caused errors in steps 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 137, 138, 139, and 140.\n- Use the `clear_entity` or `clear_area` functions to remove blocking entities before placement.\n\n#### Errors when retrieving entities that do not exist\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specific position before attempting to retrieve or interact with it. Errors occurred in steps 136, 141, 142, and 143 when trying to retrieve non-existent burner mining drills or wooden chests.\n- Use conditional checks or ensure the entity is placed before interacting with it.\n\n#### Errors when inspecting inventory of non-existent entities\n- Ensure the entity exists before inspecting its inventory. An error occurred in step 141 when attempting to inspect the inventory of a non-existent wooden chest.\n- Always verify the entity's presence before performing inventory-related operations."}
