{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0), currently working with a fuel inventory of coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0), currently working with a fuel inventory of coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0), currently working with a fuel inventory of coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0), working and extracting iron ore, with a warning that the chest at drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5), used to store extracted iron ore, currently full.\n- Additional Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure to regularly extract iron plates from furnaces to prevent them from reaching full output status, which halts production.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to ensure continuous operation of the burner mining drill. A full chest prevents further mining.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the count of various items like 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `furnace_status`: Dict[str, EntityStatus] - Tracks the working status and warnings of furnaces.\n- `mining_drill_status`: Dict[str, EntityStatus] - Tracks the working status and warnings of the burner mining drill."}
