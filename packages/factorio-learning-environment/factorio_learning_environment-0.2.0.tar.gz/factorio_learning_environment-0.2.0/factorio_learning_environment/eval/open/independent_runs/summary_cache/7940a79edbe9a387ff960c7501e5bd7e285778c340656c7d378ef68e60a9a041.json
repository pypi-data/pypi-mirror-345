{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel and currently working. It has a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5) where it deposits mined resources.\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that stores iron ore, currently holding 255 iron ore.\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently inactive.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting iron ore into the furnace or chest**\n  - Ensure you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace or chest. The logs indicate multiple attempts to insert iron ore without having it in the inventory.\n\n- **Errors when refueling the furnace**\n  - The furnace status indicates \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" after refueling. Ensure that the furnace has the required ingredients to operate. \n\n- **Errors when the chest at the drop position is full**\n  - The burner mining drill warns that the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Empty the chest to allow the mining drill to continue operating.\n\n- **Errors when harvesting coal**\n  - Ensure you are not attempting to harvest from a coal patch that has already been depleted.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None invoked in the current steps.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `current_inventory`: dict[str, int] = {'wood': 6}\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict[str, int] = {'iron-ore': 255}\n  - `nearest_coal_position`: tuple[float, float] = (40.5, -82.5)"}
