{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently refueled with coal and is extracting iron ore from the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5). \n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which is receiving iron ore from the burner mining drill. The chest currently holds 5 iron ore.\n- The burner mining drill has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position is full and needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently full of coal but has no ingredients to smelt. It has a warning indicating that the fuel source is full.\n\n### Additional Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) which contains 100 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Harvesting Area at position(40.5, -82.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Coal is being harvested from this position, although no specific entity is mentioned in the logs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient coal for refueling\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel the Burner Mining Drill. Check your inventory frequently to avoid running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors when extracting from a full chest\n- The burner mining drill has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position is full. Make sure to empty the wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to allow continued extraction of iron ore.\n\n### Errors when trying to smelt without ingredients\n- The stone furnace is currently unable to smelt anything due to a lack of ingredients. Ensure that you have the necessary raw materials available for smelting before using the furnace.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: type: int, assigned: 4 (current inventory of coal)\n- `iron-ore`: type: int, assigned: 3064 (current inventory of iron ore)\n- `iron-plate`: type: int, assigned: 100 (current inventory of iron plates)"}
