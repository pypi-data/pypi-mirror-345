{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Production Line at position(-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-28, -61)\n- Stone furnace at position(-27, -59)\n- Both entities are working and fueled with coal\n\n### Iron Production Complex at position(-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in a row:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-10, -59)\n- Burner mining drill at position(-8, -59)\n- Burner mining drill at position(-6, -59)\nAll drills are working and properly fueled\n\nConnected infrastructure:\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions(-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters managing material flow between drills and chests\n- Transport belt system connecting the production line\n\n### Smelting Array at position(0, 0)\nFour parallel smelting units consisting of:\n- Stone furnaces at positions(0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0)\n- Input wooden chests at positions(0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at positions(0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserters managing input and output for each furnace\nAll furnaces are fueled but currently idle due to lack of ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters near existing structures\n- When placing inserters next to entities, ensure there is enough space considering the entity dimensions\n- Check if the target position isn't blocked by another entity's collision box\n- Consider adjusting the spacing parameter when using place_entity_next_to function\n- Verify the direction parameter is compatible with the existing structure layout\n\n### Entity output blocking issues\n- Ensure there is a valid output destination (chest, belt, etc.) before items are produced\n- Check if output inserters have valid drop positions\n- Verify transport belt connections are complete and properly oriented\n\n### Resource management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner entities to maintain continuous operation\n- Ensure proper material flow between production stages\n- Set up proper input/output connections before starting production"}
