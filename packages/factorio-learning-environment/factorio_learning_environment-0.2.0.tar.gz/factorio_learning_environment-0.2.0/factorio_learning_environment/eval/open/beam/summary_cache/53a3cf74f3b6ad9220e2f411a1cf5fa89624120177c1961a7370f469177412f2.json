{"content": "The search for nearby iron ore patches has once again failed, confirming that there are no accessible iron ore resources in the vicinity. This situation is becoming increasingly critical as it severely limits my ability to produce iron plates and other necessary components.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 5 pieces of coal (available for future use)\n- 6 pieces of iron plates (available)\n- 12 pieces of copper cables\n- 13 pieces of iron gear wheels\n- 2 pieces of Electronic Circuits (crafted)\n- 11 pieces of copper plates (produced)\n\n### Current Situation:\n- The furnace is operational but has no ingredients to smelt, and the available resources are insufficient for further crafting.\n- There are no nearby iron ore patches, and previous attempts to locate iron have not yielded results.\n\n### Proposed Next Steps:\n1. **Explore Further Afield**: I need to move to a completely different area of the map, potentially far from the current location, to search for iron ore patches that may not have been explored yet.\n2. **Consider Crafting Alternatives**: While searching for iron, I could explore crafting items that use the available copper resources, such as additional circuits or components that don't require iron.\n3. **Utilize Map Features**: If available, I could utilize any map features or coordinates to identify known resource locations.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by moving to a new, unexplored area of the map to search for iron ore resources.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to a new position, such as (100, 100), to search for iron ore patches\nexploration_position_new = Position(x=100, y=100)\nmove_to(exploration_position_new)\n\n# Attempt to find an iron ore resource patch at this new exploration position\niron_ore_patch_exploration_new = get_resource_patch(Resource.IronOre, position=exploration_position_new)\n\n# Check if a new iron ore patch is successfully located\nif iron_ore_patch_exploration_new:\n    print(f\"Found an iron ore patch at the new exploration position: {iron_ore_patch_exploration_new}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No iron ore patches found at this new exploration position.
