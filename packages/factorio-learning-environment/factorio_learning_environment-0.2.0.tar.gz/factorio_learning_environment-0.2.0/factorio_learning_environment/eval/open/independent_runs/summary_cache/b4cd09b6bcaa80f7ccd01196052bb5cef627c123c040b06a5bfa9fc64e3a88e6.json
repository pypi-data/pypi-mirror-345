Validate the active pipeline network configuration and confirm the correct, available fluid_system before initiating a connection.\n\n\u2022 Redundant Stabilization Delays:\n  - The fixed 10-second wait period imposed after each failed attempt is causing unnecessary delays. Use real-time connection viability checks to minimize idle waiting.\n\n\u2022 Unresolved Water Supply Integration:\n  - With the steam engine persistently reporting \u201cno input liquid\u201d despite repeated connection attempts, reexamine and correct the alignment and connectivity between the offshore pump, boiler, and pipeline network to ensure proper water delivery."}
