{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0): Extracts coal from the nearby coal patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5): Stores coal extracted by the burner mining drill.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates. Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like burner mining drills, stone furnaces, or wooden chests.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Crafting complex items like burner mining drills requires intermediate items (e.g., iron plates, iron gear wheels). Ensure you have all necessary sub-ingredients before attempting to craft.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities without having the items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items (e.g., coal) in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like burner mining drills.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without sufficient resources\n- Double-check the resource requirements for crafting items. For example, crafting a burner mining drill requires 5 stone, 3 iron plates, and 3 iron gear wheels. Gather all necessary resources before attempting to craft.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without ingredients\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel (e.g., coal) and smeltable ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to operate."}
