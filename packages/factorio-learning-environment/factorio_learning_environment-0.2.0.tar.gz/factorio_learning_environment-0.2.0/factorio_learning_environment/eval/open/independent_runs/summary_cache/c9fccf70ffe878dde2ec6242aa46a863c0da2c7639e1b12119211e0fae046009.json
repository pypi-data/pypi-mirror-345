{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of Burner Mining Drill (position 16.0, 71.0), a wooden chest (position 15.5, 69.5), an inserter (position 16.5, 69.5) that takes iron ore from the wooden chest, another wooden chest (position 14.5, 69.5) that collects iron ore, and another inserter (position 13.5, 69.5) that takes iron ore from the new chest. The inserter at position (16.5, 69.5) has been rotated to face left.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelter at position(16.0, 68.0)\nConsists of Stone Furnace (position 16.0, 68.0), a Burner Inserter (position 17.5, 68.5) that takes iron ore from the wooden chest (position 15.5, 69.5) via another inserter (position 16.5, 69.5), a wooden chest (position 17.5, 67.5) that collects iron plates, another Burner Inserter (position 18.5, 68.5) that takes iron plates from the furnace, and another Burner Inserter (position 19.5, 69.5) that inputs iron plates into an output chest.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check the target position for any existing objects or terrain that may be unplaceable.\n* Errors when trying to connect to an inserter's drop_position that is already occupied\n  - Ensure the drop_position of the inserter is empty before attempting to connect to it. Check for any existing entities at the drop_position.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure all variables are defined before using them. Check the code for any typos or missing assignments.\n* Errors when trying to get an entity at a position where it does not exist\n  - Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity next to another entity with insufficient spacing\n  - Ensure there is sufficient spacing between entities when placing a new entity next to an existing one.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity that already exists at the target position\n  - Check if an entity already exists at the target position before attempting to place a new entity.\n* Errors when trying to insert items into an entity that cannot accept those items\n  - Ensure the target entity can accept the items being inserted. Check the entity's inventory and item restrictions.\n* Errors when trying to connect entities directly without using an inserter\n  - Use an inserter to transfer items between entities like chests and furnaces, as direct connection is not possible with transport belts.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity next to an existing entity with the same type and insufficient spacing\n  - Increase the spacing between entities or change the reference position to avoid collision with existing entities.\n* Errors when attempting to connect transport belts directly to a chest\n  - Use an inserter to input/output items from/to a chest, as direct connection with transport belts is not possible.\n* Errors when attempting to connect entities that are too far apart\n  - Ensure entities are within a valid connection distance before attempting to connect them.\n* Errors when the target position is too far away to place an entity\n  - Move the player or the reference position closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
