{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) via a transport belt group.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -66.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) moving items from a Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) to a Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) moving items from a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-25.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -65.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-24.5, -64.5) to (-22.5, -64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using transport belts\n- Ensure that the transport belt objects are properly initialized and connected. The error indicates a 'NoneType' object issue, which suggests that the belt objects may not be correctly instantiated or linked.\n\n### Errors when adjusting transport belts\n- Before attempting to adjust transport belts, verify that the belt entities are properly defined and have the necessary attributes. The error suggests that the belt objects might be missing the 'tile_dimensions' attribute, indicating incomplete initialization."}
