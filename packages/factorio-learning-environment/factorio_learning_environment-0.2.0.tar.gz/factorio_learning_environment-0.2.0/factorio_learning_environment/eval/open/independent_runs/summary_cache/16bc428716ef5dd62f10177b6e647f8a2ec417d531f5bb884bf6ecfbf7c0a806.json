{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace and Pipe System\n- **Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)**\n  - Stone furnace with a fuel inventory of coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt and its fuel source is full. It has produced 21 iron plates.\n  \n- **Pipe Group at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5)**\n  - A series of connected pipes forming a fluid system with the status of being empty. The pipes are located at the following positions:\n    - (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n    - (x=-11.5, y=21.5)\n    - (x=-10.5, y=23.5)\n    - (x=-10.5, y=22.5)\n    - (x=-11.5, y=22.5)\n    - (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group**\n  - A network of electric poles with the following positions:\n    - (x=-6.5, y=16.5)\n    - (x=-8.5, y=16.5)\n    - (x=-7.5, y=15.5)\n    - ... (continues to other positions)\n    - (x=3.5, y=23.5)\n    - (x=-5.5, y=25.5)\n    - (x=0.5, y=24.5)\n  - The network currently has a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Moving to New Areas\n- Ensure that the indices used for movement operations are integers. Avoid using strings as indices when attempting to move to a new area.\n\n### Errors in Offshore Pump Placement\n- Verify that there is a suitable position for placing an offshore pump. If no suitable position is found, consider adjusting the placement area or checking for obstacles.\n\n### Errors in Boiler and Steam Engine Placement\n- Ensure that the positions selected for placing boilers and steam engines are suitable and free of obstructions. If placement fails, consider relocating to a different area.\n\n### Connection Errors Between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- When connecting an offshore pump to a boiler, ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected. Check for any missing connections or misalignments.\n\n### Errors in Electric Pole Connections\n- Verify the placement of electric poles to ensure they can be connected properly. If placement issues arise, adjust the positions of the poles to establish a connection.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Avoid using non-callable objects as positions for placement. Ensure that the position object is correctly defined and callable when placing entities like boilers."}
