{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel and currently operational. It has a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5) where it deposits extracted resources into a wooden chest.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore (9 units). It is currently full and prevents further extraction from the burner mining drill.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal (3 units) and currently operational, producing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Not enough coal in the new Wooden Chest to refuel the Burner Mining Drill.**\n  - Ensure that the wooden chest contains sufficient coal before attempting to refuel the burner mining drill.\n  \n- **Could not extract iron-ore from wooden-chest.**\n  - Check that the wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) contains iron ore before attempting to extract it. If the chest is full, consider emptying it to allow for more extraction.\n\n- **Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.**\n  - Verify that you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the stone furnace. If you lack iron ore, consider extracting from the wooden chest first.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, original_chest, quantity=3)`: Failed due to the wooden chest not containing the required iron ore.\n  - `insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=1)`: Failed multiple times due to lack of iron ore in inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `original_chest`: Entity (Wooden Chest at position -14.5, -48.5)\n  - `furnace`: Entity (Stone Furnace at position 0.0, 0.0)\n  - `quantity`: Integer (3 for extraction, 1 for insertion)"}
