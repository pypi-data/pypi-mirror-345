{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at (15.5,70.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) facing DOWN (connected to power)\n- Stone furnace at (16.0,73.0) (out of fuel, no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at (17.5,70.5) (facing furnace, has fuel)\n- Wooden chest at (16.5,76.5) (output storage)\n- Output inserter at (16.5,75.5) (connects furnace to chest)\n\n### Power Generation System at (-11.5,69.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Offshore pump at (-11.5,69.5) (working, producing water)\n- Boiler at (-6.5,70.0) (out of fuel)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5,70.5) (not connected to power network)\n- Pipe network connecting water system (positions: (-11.5,68.5), (-10.5,68.5), (-9.5,68.5), (-9.5,69.5), (-8.5,69.5), (-8.5,70.5))\n- Steam pipe network (positions: (-5.5,67.5), (-4.5,67.5), (-3.5,67.5), (-2.5,67.5), (-6.5,68.5), (-5.5,68.5))\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement distance errors\n- Repeated attempts to place entities too far from player position (steps 9,11,13)\n- Solution: Always move to target area before placing entities (max placement distance is 10 tiles)\n\n### Entity placement collision errors\n- Multiple failed attempts to place chests/inserters at (15.5,73.5) due to existing furnace (steps 12,14,15)\n- Solution: \n  - Check for existing entities before placement\n  - Choose different positions when collisions occur\n  - Increase spacing between components\n\n### Power system issues\n- Steam engine not connected to power network despite having pipes\n- Solution:\n  - Ensure proper pipe connections between boiler and engine\n  - Add fuel to boiler to generate steam\n  - Verify power pole connections\n\n### Transport belt connection errors\n- Still attempting direct furnace-to-belt connections (step 8)\n- Solution: Always use inserters between furnaces and belts\n\n### Setup function failures\n- Multiple mining setup functions failing due to placement issues (steps 14,15)\n- Solution: \n  - Add collision checks to setup functions\n  - Implement error handling for placement failures\n  - Verify all required positions are clear before placement"}
