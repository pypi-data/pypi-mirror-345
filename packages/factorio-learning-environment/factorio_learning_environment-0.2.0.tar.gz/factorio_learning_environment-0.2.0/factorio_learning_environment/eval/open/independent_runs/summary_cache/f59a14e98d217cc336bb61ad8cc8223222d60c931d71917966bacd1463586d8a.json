Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position if an entity already occupies the target position.\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. Ensure that burner-inserters or other required items are available in your inventory to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function correctly. Check the supply chain and ensure that materials are being delivered to the inserters' source positions."}
