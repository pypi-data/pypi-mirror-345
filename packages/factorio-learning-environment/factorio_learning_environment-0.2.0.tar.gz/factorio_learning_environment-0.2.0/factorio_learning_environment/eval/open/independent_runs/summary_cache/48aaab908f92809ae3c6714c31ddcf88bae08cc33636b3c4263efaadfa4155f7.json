{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the execution logs provided:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (41, -85)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (41, -85) extracting coal\n- Burner inserter (42.5, -83.5) moving coal from drill to chest\n- Wooden chest (43.5, -83.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production System 1 at (-20, -54)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-20, -54) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace (-19, -52) smelting iron plates\nNote: Output is currently blocked due to missing inserter\n\n### Iron Plate Production System 2 at (-14, -56)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-14, -56) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace (-13, -54) smelting iron plates\nNote: Output is currently blocked due to missing inserter\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing inserters, ensure there is sufficient space and no existing entities at the target location\n- Check for collisions with existing structures before placement\n- Consider the entity's size and required clearance when placing near other structures\n- When placing entities next to each other, verify the direction and spacing parameters are compatible with the layout\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in inventory before attempting to insert into entities\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Structure Design\n- Plan the layout of mining-furnace-inserter systems carefully to ensure all components can be properly placed\n- Consider the direction and spacing of entities during initial placement to allow for inserters and belts\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to(entity_type, reference_pos, spacing, direction): Attempts to place an entity relative to a reference position\n- place_entity(entity_type, position): Places an entity at specific coordinates\n- insert_item(item_type, target_entity, quantity): Inserts items into an entity\n- extract_item(source_entity): Extracts items from an entity\n\nVariables:\n- inserter1, inserter2: BurnerInserter\n- drill1, drill2: BurnerMiningDrill\n- furnace1, furnace2: Furnace\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- place_entity_next_to: Fails when target position is blocked or invalid\n- insert_item: Fails when source inventory lacks required items\n- place_entity: Fails when target position is occupied"}
