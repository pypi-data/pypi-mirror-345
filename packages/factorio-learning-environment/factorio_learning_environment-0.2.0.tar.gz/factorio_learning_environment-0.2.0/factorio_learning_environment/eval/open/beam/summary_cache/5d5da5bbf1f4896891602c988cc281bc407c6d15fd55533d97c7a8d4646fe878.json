Since both furnaces are operational, we should monitor their production.\n2. Consider gathering more iron ore and coal to ensure continuous operation without interruptions.\n3. Once we accumulate a significant number of iron plates, we can plan for crafting additional entities or expanding our factory.\n\nLet's continue monitoring the production process and see how many iron plates are produced over time.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the furnaces to process their iron ore\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration as needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-92]"}
