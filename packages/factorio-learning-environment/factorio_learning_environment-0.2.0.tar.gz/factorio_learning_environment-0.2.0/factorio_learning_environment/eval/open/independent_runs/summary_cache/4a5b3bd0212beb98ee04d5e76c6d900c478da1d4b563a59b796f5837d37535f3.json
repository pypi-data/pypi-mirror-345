{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (5.5, 21.5) connected to small electric poles and pipes, currently working.\n- **Boiler** at position (-1.5, 24.0) fueled with coal, connected to pipes, currently working.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) connected to pipes, currently working.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, facilitating water and steam flow.\n\n### Lab Facility at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Lab** at position (2.5, 0.5) currently working on Automation research, connected to the electricity network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials before attempting to craft items like copper cables and small electric poles. Check your inventory for required resources.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like steam engines and labs using electric poles.\n- Ensure correct placement and connection of pipes between entities like offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Double-check the existence and position of entities like labs before attempting operations on them.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Ensure all variables are correctly defined and initialized before use. For example, define 'copper_cable_needed_for_poles' before using it in calculations.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Regularly check the status of critical entities like steam engines to ensure they are working as expected. Address any issues promptly to maintain functionality.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in entities like boilers and ensure sufficient coal is available to keep them operational. Regularly mine and refuel as necessary."}
