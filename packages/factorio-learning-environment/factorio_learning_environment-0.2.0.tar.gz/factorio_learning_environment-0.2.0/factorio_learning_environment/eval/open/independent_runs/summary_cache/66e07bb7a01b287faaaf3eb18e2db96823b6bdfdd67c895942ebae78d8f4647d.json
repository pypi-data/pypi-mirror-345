{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from chests to a furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently full with 100 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring items between chests and the furnace. Currently out of fuel.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) also smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently full with 100 iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) storing 700 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to storage. Currently waiting for source items.\n\n### Auxiliary Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) currently empty.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing 1 iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest, furnace) has items available for the inserter to transfer.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure the destination entity (e.g., chest, furnace) has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and clear the inventory of furnaces and chests to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Errors with Undefined or Missing Entities\n- Verify the existence and correct naming of entities before attempting to interact with them. Ensure that all entities are properly placed and defined in the game environment.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel inserters to ensure they continue operating efficiently. Keep track of fuel levels and replenish as necessary."}
