{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, ensuring water and steam flow.\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n#### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=20.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for copper ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n#### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for crafting copper cables.\n- Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) that moves items into the assembling machine.\n- Belt group connecting the furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) to the assembling machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, coal was missing when trying to insert into the boiler.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be resolved by ensuring that the production chain is not interrupted and that resources are continuously supplied.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the destination entity for the inserter to place items. This can be managed by regularly clearing out or expanding storage capacities.\n\n#### Assembling Machine Ingredient Shortage\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for the assembling machine to function. For instance, the assembling machine was missing copper plates needed to produce copper cables."}
