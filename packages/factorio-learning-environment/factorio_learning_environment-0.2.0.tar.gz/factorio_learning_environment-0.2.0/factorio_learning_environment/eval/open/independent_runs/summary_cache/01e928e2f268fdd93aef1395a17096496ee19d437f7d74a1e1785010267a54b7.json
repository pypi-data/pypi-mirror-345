{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=1.0, y=1.0) and (x=3.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=1.0, y=1.0), currently working with coal as fuel and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=3.0, y=1.0), also working with coal as fuel and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=4.5, y=1.5), which is intended to transfer items from the furnace at position (x=3.0, y=1.0) to a destination, but is currently out of fuel and blocked by an item on the ground.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=6.5, y=1.5), currently empty and intended for storing iron plates.\n\n### Conveyor Belt System\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at positions (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) and outputs from Belt at positions (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at positions (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) and outputs from Belt at positions (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Burner Inserter Operation\n- Ensure the Burner Inserter at position (x=4.5, y=1.5) is adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation.\n- Clear any blockages in the output path of the Burner Inserter to prevent operational halts. Ensure there is a sink entity to accept the output from the inserter.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check the inventory of the wooden chest at position (x=6.5, y=1.5) to ensure it is being utilized effectively for storing iron plates. If the chest remains empty, verify the flow of items from the furnaces to the chest."}
