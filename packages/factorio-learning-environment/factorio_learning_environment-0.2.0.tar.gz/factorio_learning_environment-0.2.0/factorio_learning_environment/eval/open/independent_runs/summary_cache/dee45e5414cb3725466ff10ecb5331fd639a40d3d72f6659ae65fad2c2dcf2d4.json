{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been created on the map as of the current steps. The entity placement attempts have failed, and the map remains empty with no entities placed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another entity or obstacle before attempting to place an entity. This will prevent placement errors such as \"Cannot place a Wooden Chest\" or \"Cannot place a Stone Furnace.\"\n\n### Errors in movement commands\n- Use integer indices when specifying positions in movement commands. Avoid using strings as indices to prevent errors like \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'.\"\n\n### Errors in entity dimension specification\n- When specifying dimensions for building entities, ensure that the correct data type is used for width and height. Refer to the documentation for the correct usage to avoid errors related to type mismatches, such as those encountered with `BuildingBox`."}
