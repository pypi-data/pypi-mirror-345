This includes checking for existing entities or obstacles that may prevent placement.\n- Specific errors include:\n  - Attempting to place a Wooden Chest at positions (0.0, 10.0), (10.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0), and (20.0, 20.0).\n  - Attempting to place a Burner Inserter at position (-100.0, 100.0).\n  - Attempting to place a Stone Furnace at position (50.0, 50.0).\n  - Multiple positions around (0.5, 0.5) and other coordinates were not clear for placement.\n\n### General Placement Tips\n- Before placing any entity, verify that the intended location is free of other entities and is a valid position for the type of entity being placed.\n- Consider using the map or a planning tool to visualize and confirm clear spaces for construction.\n- Regularly check the map for any changes or updates that might affect placement decisions."}
