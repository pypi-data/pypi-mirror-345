{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) which is currently working and supplying iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) which is currently working and producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, attempting to place a burner-mining-drill without having one in inventory will result in an error.\n- Verify that the location is suitable and unoccupied before placing an entity such as a Wooden Chest, Transport Belt, or Burner Inserter. Attempting to place these entities in occupied or unsuitable locations will cause placement errors.\n\n### Furnace not producing iron plates\n- Ensure that the furnace setup is correct, with the necessary inputs and fuel, to maintain continuous production of iron plates. Check connections and supply lines to avoid production halts."}
