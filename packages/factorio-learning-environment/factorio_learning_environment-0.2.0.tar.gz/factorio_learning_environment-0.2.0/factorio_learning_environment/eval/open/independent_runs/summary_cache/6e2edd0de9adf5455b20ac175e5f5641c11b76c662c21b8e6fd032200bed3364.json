{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal, currently holding 51 iron plates.\n- Inserter at position (x=17.5, y=0.5) with no power, waiting for source items, connected to a small electric pole at (x=17.5, y=-0.5).\n- Inserter at position (x=16.5, y=0.5) with no power, connected to the furnace and a small electric pole.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=5.5, y=0.5) and another at position (x=18.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-1.5, y=17.5) with several pipe segments.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=0.5, y=16.5) with several pipe segments.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5) with several pipe segments.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=20.5) with a single pipe segment.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-4.5, y=23.5) with several pipe segments.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of an ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (x=11.5, y=6.5), (x=7.5, y=10.5), and (x=17.5, y=-0.5), but currently not supplying power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity such as an offshore pump, boiler, or steam engine.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors in movement commands\n- Ensure that the move_to command uses integer indices for positions, not strings.\n\n### Errors in checking component status\n- Verify the presence of entities at specified positions before attempting to access their status to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Errors in electricity supply\n- Ensure that all necessary connections are made and that power sources are active to supply electricity to inserters and other entities."}
