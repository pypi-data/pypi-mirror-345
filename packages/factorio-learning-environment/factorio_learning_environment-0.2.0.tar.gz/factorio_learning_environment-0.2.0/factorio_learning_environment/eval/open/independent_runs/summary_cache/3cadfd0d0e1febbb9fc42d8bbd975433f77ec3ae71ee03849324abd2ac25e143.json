{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0):** \n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Inventory: 26 iron plates\n  - Fuel: 7 units of coal\n- **Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0):** \n  - Status: Working\n  - Inventory: 25 iron plates\n  - Fuel: 6 units of coal\n- **Wooden Chests:**\n  - Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) with 5 units of coal\n  - Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) with 5 units of coal\n  - Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) with 5 units of coal\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0):**\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: 12 units of coal\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5)\n    - Burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5)\n    - Wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5)\n- **Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5):**\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: 1 unit of coal\n  - Neighbours:\n    - Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5)\n    - Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n    - Wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5)\n- **Wooden Chests:**\n  - Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with 787 units of coal\n  - Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) is empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source entity.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to maintain production. Regularly check and refill the ingredient supply to avoid production halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined in the current logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n  - `entities`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities on the map, including their positions, statuses, and inventories."}
