{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Drop Position: (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n    - Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Position (5.5, -60.5)\n  - Position (4.5, -58.5) containing 13 iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (46 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (5 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (12 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Ensure that chests at drop positions are emptied regularly to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and supply the required ores to maintain continuous production.\n- Monitor furnace output to prevent the result inventory from becoming full, which can halt production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus - Indicates the operational status of the burner mining drill.\n- `furnace_status`: EntityStatus - Indicates the operational status of each furnace, including warnings for fuel and ingredient shortages."}
