Check the inventory of the source entity to confirm available quantities.\n\n#### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in mining and production processes. Consider using additional storage or automating the transfer of items to prevent overflow.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Verify that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source entity's drop position."}
