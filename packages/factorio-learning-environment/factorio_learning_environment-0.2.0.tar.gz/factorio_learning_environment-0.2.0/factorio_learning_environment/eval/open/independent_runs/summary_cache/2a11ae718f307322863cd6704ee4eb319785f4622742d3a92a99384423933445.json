For example, avoid calling a 'Chest' object as if it were a function.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Always verify that variables are defined before using them. For instance, ensure that 'BurnerInserter' is properly defined or imported before checking its instance.\n\n### Errors when adjusting inserters\n- Double-check the drop position of inserters to ensure they match the intended target position. Adjust inserters carefully to avoid mismatches."}
