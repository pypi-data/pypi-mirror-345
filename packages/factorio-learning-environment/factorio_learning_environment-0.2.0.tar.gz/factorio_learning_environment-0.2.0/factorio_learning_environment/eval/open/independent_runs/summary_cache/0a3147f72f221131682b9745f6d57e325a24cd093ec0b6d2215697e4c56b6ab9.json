There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity such as a Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, or Transport Belt.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to a new location\n- Verify that the destination location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move entities like the Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by checking the map for the entity's presence.\n\n### Errors when extracting from drills with blocked outputs\n- Ensure that the output of the drill is clear and that there is a sink entity available to accept the output to avoid blockage warnings."}
