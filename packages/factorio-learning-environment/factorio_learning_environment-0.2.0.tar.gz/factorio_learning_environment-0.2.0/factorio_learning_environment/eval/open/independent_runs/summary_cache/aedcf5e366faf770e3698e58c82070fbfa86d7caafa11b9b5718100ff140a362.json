{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at (-41, -80)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest\n- Transport belt system:\n  - First belt at (43.5, -80.5)\n  - Second belt at (44.5, -80.5)\n- Stone furnace at (46.0, -80.0)\n\nThe system is designed to mine coal and transport it via belts to a furnace, though currently experiencing some operational issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Verify terrain compatibility before placing structures - multiple attempts to place furnace failed due to water or blocked terrain\n- Clear any items or entities from target location before attempting to place new structures\n\n### System Design Issues\n- Transport belt blockage causing upstream congestion - need to ensure proper item flow through the system\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining equipment - mining drill ran out of fuel during operation\n\n### Entity Configuration Issues\n- Ensure proper alignment between inserters and their target entities\n- When using transport belts, verify the entire logistics chain is properly connected and aligned\n- Pay attention to rotation of inserters relative to input/output positions\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- furnace: Entity (stone-furnace)\n- belt: Entity (transport-belt)\n\n### System States\n- Mining drill status transitions: WORKING \u2192 NO_FUEL\n- Inserter status: WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- Belt status: WORKING\n- Furnace status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\nThe logs show multiple attempts to reconfigure a coal mining and transport system, with several iterations trying to resolve placement and alignment issues between the inserter, transport belts, and furnace components."}
