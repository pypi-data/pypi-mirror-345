Ongoing issues with pipe placement and connection have left the steam engine unplaced and the steam delivery network unmerged.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Pipeline Placement & Connection:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing a pipe. Repeated failures at positions (-6.5, 24.5), (-5.5, 24.5), (-3.5, 24.5), (-2.5, 24.5), and (-1.5, 24.5) indicate conflicts with existing objects.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that connecting endpoints are correctly aligned and carry compatible fluid types; mismatches can lead to rejected connections, as seen when attempting to link steam output to the engine.\n\u2003\u2013 When attempting offset placements (e.g. shifting a pipe from the boiler\u2019s steam output), confirm that the new position does not already host another entity (such as a boiler).\n\n\u2022 Entity Repositioning & Placement:\n\u2003\u2013 Always move the player within the allowable range before attempting to reposition an entity. Failures to place the steam engine at (-5.0, 28.0) resulted from exceeding the maximum distance.\n\u2003\u2013 Assess the buildable area for obstacles such as water; vertical pipe placements failed repeatedly due to overlapping water footprints.\n\n\u2022 Fluid Network Integration:\n\u2003\u2013 Before merging or connecting fluid systems, confirm that valid pipe groups exist at both the source and target. The inability to find expected pipe groups indicates misalignment or missing components.\n\u2003\u2013 Check that fluid types at connection points match the receiving machine\u2019s requirements to avoid mismatches and connection errors.\n\n\u2022 Utility Usage & Code Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 When retrieving positional data (e.g. calculating a center point), ensure that attributes are accessed correctly rather than called as functions. The TypeError encountered when invoking center() on a Position object indicates a misuse of the attribute access methodology."}
