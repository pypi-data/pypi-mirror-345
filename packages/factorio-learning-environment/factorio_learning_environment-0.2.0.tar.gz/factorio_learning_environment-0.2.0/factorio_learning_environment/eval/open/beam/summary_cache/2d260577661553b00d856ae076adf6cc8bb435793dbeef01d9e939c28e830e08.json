{"content": "The error indicates that there is no boiler in the inventory. Let's address this by crafting the necessary items before attempting to place them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Craft the Required Items:**\n   - Ensure you have the resources to craft both the Offshore Pump and the Boiler. Typically, these require iron plates and other materials.\n\n2. **Craft an Offshore Pump:**\n   ```python\n   crafted_pumps = craft_item(Prototype.OffshorePump, quantity=1)\n   assert crafted_pumps > 0, \"Failed to craft an Offshore Pump.\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Craft a Boiler:**\n   ```python\n   crafted_boilers = craft_item(Prototype.Boiler, quantity=1)\n   assert crafted_boilers > 0, \"Failed to craft a Boiler.\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Locate Water and Place the Offshore Pump:**\n   - Find the nearest water resource.\n   - Move to the water position.\n   - Place the Offshore Pump.\n\n5. **Place the Boiler Next to the Offshore Pump:**\n   - Determine the position adjacent to the Offshore Pump.\n   - Place the Boiler.\n\n6. **Insert Coal into the Boiler:**\n   - Ensure the Boiler has fuel to start generating steam.\n\n7. **Place the Steam Engine:**\n   - Craft a Steam Engine if not already available.\n   - Place it adjacent to the Boiler.\n\n8. **Connect the Power Grid:**\n   - Use Electric Poles to connect the Steam Engine to the power grid or directly to the Assembling Machine.\n\n### Example Code:\n```python\n# Craft necessary items\ncrafted_pumps = craft_item(Prototype.OffshorePump, quantity=1)\nassert crafted_pumps > 0, \"Failed to craft an Offshore Pump.\"\n\ncrafted_boilers = craft_item(Prototype.Boiler, quantity=1)\nassert crafted_boilers > 0, \"Failed to craft a Boiler.\"\n\ncrafted_engines = craft_item(Prototype.SteamEngine, quantity=1)\nassert crafted_engines > 0, \"Failed to craft a Steam Engine.\"\n\n# Place Offshore Pump\nwater_position = nearest(Resource.Water)\nmove_to(water_position)\noffshore_pump = place_entity(Prototype.OffshorePump, position=water_position)\nassert offshore_pump, \"Failed to place offshore pump.\"\n\n# Place Boiler\nboiler_position = offshore_pump.position.right()\nboiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\nassert boiler, \"Failed to place the boiler.\"\n\n# Insert coal into the boiler\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=5)\n\n# Place Steam Engine\nsteam_engine_position = boiler.position.right()\nsteam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=steam_engine_position)\nassert steam_engine, \"Failed to place a steam engine.\"\n\n# Connect to power grid\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after infrastructure: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Resource Check:** Always ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before crafting.\n- **Inventory Management:** Regularly check your inventory to avoid running out of essential items.\n- **Positioning:** Be mindful of the positioning of entities to ensure efficient space usage and connectivity.", "summary_range": "[1-148]"}
