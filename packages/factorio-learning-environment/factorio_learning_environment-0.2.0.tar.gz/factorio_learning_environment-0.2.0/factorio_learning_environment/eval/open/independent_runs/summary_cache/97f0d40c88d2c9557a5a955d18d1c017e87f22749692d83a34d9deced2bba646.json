{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. Although existing furnaces were referenced during smelting (e.g. a furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)), no new building or assembly\u2014such as a Lab\u2014was created.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n\u2003\u2013 When invoking get_entities, use its correct signature. Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (such as 'radius') and ensure that the number of positional arguments matches the function\u2019s definition.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Validations\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that a required structure (for example, a Lab) is available in the inventory before attempting to place it. Lack of proper inventory leads to placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Dependency Management\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all sub-ingredients for complex items (e.g. labs) are available in sufficient quantity. Failures citing missing items like iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, or copper-cables indicate that the production chain and resource acquisition need to be secured before initiating crafting.\n\n\u2022 None Iteration Safeguards\n\u2003\u2013 When processing results from entity queries, check that the returned value is not None (or provide a fallback, such as an empty list) to prevent iteration errors."}
