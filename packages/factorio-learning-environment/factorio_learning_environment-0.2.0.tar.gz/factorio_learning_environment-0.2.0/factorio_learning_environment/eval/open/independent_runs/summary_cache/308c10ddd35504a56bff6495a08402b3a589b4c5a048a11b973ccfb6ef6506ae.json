{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) and (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) connected to stone furnaces\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) storing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5) storing iron plates\n- Transport Belt connecting furnaces to wooden chests\n\n#### Electricity Generation Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5)\n- Pipe network connecting offshore pump to boiler and steam engine\n\n#### Iron Plate Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Transport Belts from position (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) and from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) storing iron plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the entities are correctly aligned and compatible before attempting to connect them. Specifically, when connecting pipes, ensure they are placed correctly to connect the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of items to pick up. Check the input source and ensure it is not blocked or empty.\n\n#### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter's output is not full or blocked. Consider adding additional storage or processing capacity to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n#### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to ensure they remain operational. Consider automating the refueling process to prevent downtime."}
