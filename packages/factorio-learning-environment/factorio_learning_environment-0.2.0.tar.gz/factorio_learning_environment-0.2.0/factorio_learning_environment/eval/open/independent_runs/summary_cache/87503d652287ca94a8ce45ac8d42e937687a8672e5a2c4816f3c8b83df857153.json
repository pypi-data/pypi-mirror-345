{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully placed on the map. The agent repeatedly attempted to establish a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but all placement and crafting attempts failed due to missing inventory items and insufficient resources. Although log messages reference smelting operations at furnaces (for example, a furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) used for additional iron plate production and a \u201ccopper furnace\u201d at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper plate smelting), these actions were performed on pre\u2010existing entities and did not result in the creation of new, connected production structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API Invocation for Entity Retrieval  \n\u2003\u2013 Pass arguments to get_entities according to its defined signature. Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or providing unexpected positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting to place a Lab at a target location.\n\n\u2022 Iteration on None Values  \n\u2003\u2013 Validate that any function returning a list (or collection) does not instead return None before attempting to iterate over it.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Sub\u2010Ingredient Availability for Lab Crafting  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all prerequisite components (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are sufficiently produced. Establish complete resource chains\u2014including successful smelting operations\u2014so that crafting requirements for complex items like Labs are met."}
