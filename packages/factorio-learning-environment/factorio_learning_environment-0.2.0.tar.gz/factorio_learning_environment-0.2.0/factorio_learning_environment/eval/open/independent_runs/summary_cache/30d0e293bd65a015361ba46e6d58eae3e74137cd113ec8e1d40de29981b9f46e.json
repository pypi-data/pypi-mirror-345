{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Storage chest at (23.5, -16.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Storage chest at (-14.5, 21.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Complex at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Two burner mining drills:\n  - First drill at (20.0, 20.0) with chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n  - Second drill with chest at (22.5, 21.5)\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing copper plates\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items between furnace and output chest\n  - Second inserter at (22.5, 22.5) for input handling\n\n### Inactive Iron Processing Station at (-10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Fuel Management Issues\n- Check furnace fuel capacity before attempting to insert coal\n- Monitor furnace fuel levels to avoid overfilling (50 item limit reached in furnace at x=24, y=20)\n\n### Resource Availability Errors\n- Ensure required resources (like coal) are in inventory before attempting insertion operations\n- Consider implementing inventory checks before executing resource-dependent operations\n\n### System Design Considerations\n- When designing processing systems, ensure proper resource flow planning\n- Consider implementing buffer checks to prevent overfilling of furnaces and storage units"}
