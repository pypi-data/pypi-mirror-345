{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-23.0, -66.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) via a transport belt group starting at position (-25.5, -65.5) and ending at (-23.5, -65.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -66.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) via a Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using transport belts\n- Ensure that transport belts are correctly connected. The error \"Failed to connect transport belts: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'\" suggests a connection issue. Verify the positions and continuity of belts.\n\n### Errors when interacting with full or blocked entities\n- Check the capacity and status of entities like furnaces and chests before attempting to add more items. The error \"Furnace is full or unable to accept more iron ore.\" suggests that the furnace's input is blocked or full.\n\n### Errors when picking up entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. The error \"Could not pickup: Couldn't find transport-belt at position (-25.5, -65.5) to pick up.\" indicates that the entity was not found at the given position. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity is present.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is an available sink entity for outputs from drills or other production machines. The warning \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\" indicates that the output path is obstructed or lacks a receiving entity."}
