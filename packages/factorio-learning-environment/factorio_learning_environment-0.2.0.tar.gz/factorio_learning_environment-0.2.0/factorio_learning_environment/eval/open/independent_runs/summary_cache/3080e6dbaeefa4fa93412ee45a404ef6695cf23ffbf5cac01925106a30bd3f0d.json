{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Steam engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes and small electric poles forming an electricity network\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for coal storage\n- Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for additional storage\n- Burner inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) for transferring items\n- Belt group facilitating coal movement\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Iron chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Iron chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) containing coal\n- Iron chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) containing coal\n\n### Laboratory at Unspecified Position\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently without power\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple pipe groups facilitating fluid transport, with some sections currently empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Electricity Network Connection\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity network are properly connected and supplied with necessary resources to avoid repeated connection attempts.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers and mining drills to maintain continuous operation and avoid interruptions due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Monitor chest inventories to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Regularly empty or manage inventory to ensure smooth operation.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established and that there are no empty sections in the pipe network to maintain efficient fluid transport.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Verify that inserters have a clear path and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items as intended."}
