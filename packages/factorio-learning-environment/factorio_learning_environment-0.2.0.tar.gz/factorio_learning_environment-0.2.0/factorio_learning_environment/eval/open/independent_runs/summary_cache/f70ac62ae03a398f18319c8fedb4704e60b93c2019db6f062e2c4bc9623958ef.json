{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-16.5, -44.5) for transferring items.\n\n#### Inserter Setup at Position (-16.5, -44.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-16.5, -44.5) for item transfer.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -44.5) for item transfer.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -44.5) for item transfer.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear and buildable before attempting to place entities like wooden chests or transport belts. Repeated attempts to place entities at positions like (-17.5, -44.5) and (-16.5, -44.5) failed due to non-buildable tiles.\n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables in code\n- Avoid using undefined variables like `chest` or `transport_belt` in conditional statements. Always ensure variables are properly defined before referencing them. This error occurred multiple times in steps 224, 226, 229, 231, 232, 234, and 237.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Check if a tile is already occupied by another entity before placing a new one. Attempts to place a wooden chest at (-16.5, -45.5) and (-20.5, -44.5) failed because the tiles were not buildable."}
