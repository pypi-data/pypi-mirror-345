{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 24.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid, while the boiler is full of output.\n\n### Lab at position(0, 0)\nConsists of a lab (position 0, 0) that is currently not powered and is set to research automation.\n\n### Copper plate furnace at position(5, 5)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 5, 5) that is currently not smelting due to no ingredients.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups that are used for fluid transportation, with various positions and statuses indicating they are empty or full output.\n\n### Electric pole group\nConsists of multiple small electric poles located at various positions, including (2.5, -18.5), (1.5, -12.5), and others, forming a network for electricity distribution.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles to steam engines\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect electric poles to steam engines. Check the surrounding area for any entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
