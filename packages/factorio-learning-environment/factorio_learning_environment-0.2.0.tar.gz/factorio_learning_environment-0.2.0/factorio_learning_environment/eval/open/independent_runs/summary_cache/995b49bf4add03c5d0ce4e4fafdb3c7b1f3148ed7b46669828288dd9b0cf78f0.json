{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-1.5, 27.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (0.5, 30.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserter at Position (16.5, 0.5) and Inserter at Position (17.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (18.5, 0.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups connecting various entities for fluid transfer, including:\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 18.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-11.5, 19.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-9.5, 23.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-7.5, 24.5) (water)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 29.5) (water)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (5.5, 31.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (8.5, 34.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Check for existing objects that might obstruct placement.\n\n### Errors with Unconnected Power Network\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to the power network. Use small electric poles to connect entities like inserters and steam engines.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid-requiring entities, such as boilers and steam engines, have the necessary fluid connections. Check for missing pipes or incorrect pipe placements.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Electricity\n- Make sure inserters are connected to the power network and that the network is active. Check for any disconnected poles or missing connections."}
