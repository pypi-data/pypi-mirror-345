{"content": "The error indicates that there is no Steam Engine available in the inventory to place. Let's address this by crafting a Steam Engine, ensuring we have the necessary materials, and then proceeding with the placement.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Check Inventory for Required Materials:**\n   - Ensure you have enough iron plates and iron gear wheels to craft a Steam Engine.\n\n2. **Craft the Steam Engine:**\n   - If the materials are available, craft the Steam Engine.\n\n3. **Place the Steam Engine:**\n   - Move to the correct position and place the Steam Engine next to the Boiler.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check for required materials\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\niron_plates_needed = 5\niron_gear_wheels_needed = 5\n\n# Ensure enough iron plates and gear wheels are available\nif inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) < iron_plates_needed:\n    print(\"Not enough iron plates. Please smelt more iron ore.\")\nif inventory.get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0) < iron_gear_wheels_needed:\n    print(\"Not enough iron gear wheels. Please produce more using the assembling machine.\")\n\n# Step 2: Craft the Steam Engine\nif inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= iron_plates_needed and inventory.get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0) >= iron_gear_wheels_needed:\n    crafted_engine = craft_item(Prototype.SteamEngine, quantity=1)\n    assert crafted_engine > 0, \"Failed to craft a Steam Engine.\"\n\n# Step 3: Move closer to the target position for placing the Steam Engine\nmove_to(engine_position)\n\n# Step 4: Place the Steam Engine next to the Boiler\nsteam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=engine_position)\nassert steam_engine, \"Failed to place Steam Engine.\"\n\n# Step 5: Connect the Steam Engine to the Assembling Machine using Electric Poles\nconnected_poles = connect_entities(steam_engine, assembling_machine, Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nassert connected_poles, \"Failed to establish the electric connection.\"\n\n# Verify the setup\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after setting up power: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- Always ensure you have the necessary materials before attempting to craft an item.\n- Use the assembling machine to efficiently produce intermediate items like iron gear wheels.\n- Verify your inventory and resource availability frequently to avoid interruptions in crafting and building processes.", "summary_range": "[1-178]"}
