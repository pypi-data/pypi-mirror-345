{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0)\n  - **Drop Position**: Wooden chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5)\n  - **Warnings**: Out of fuel, chest at drop position is full\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (4.5, y=-56.5) with iron ore (800/800 items)\n  - Wooden chest at position (6.5, y=-56.5) with iron ore (8 items)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\n- **Chests**:\n  - Multiple wooden chests at positions (5.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5), (8.5, y=-60.5) each containing iron plates (183 items)\n  - Iron chest at position (-3.5, y=-52.5) with iron plates (1476 items)\n  - Wooden chest at position (-2.5, y=-52.5) with iron ore (200) and iron plates (1200)\n  - Various other chests with varying amounts of iron plates distributed across positions (-16.5, y=-54.5) to (-6.5, y=-50.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal (26) and iron plates (83)\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal (22) and iron plates (83)\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal (19) and iron plates (100)\n  - **Warnings**: No ingredients to smelt, furnace result is full\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- **Full Inventory Issues**: \n  - Ensure that the target chest has enough space before attempting to transfer items. This will prevent failed transfer attempts due to full inventory.\n  \n### Placement Errors\n- **Entity Placement Conflicts**:\n  - Verify that the target position is unoccupied before placing a new entity to avoid placement failures.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wooden-chest`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int"}
