{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -50.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-19.0, -54.0) connected to **Wooden Chest** at (-18.5, -52.5)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -54.0) connected to **Wooden Chest** at (-14.5, -54.5)\n- **Inserter** at position (-18.5, -51.5) transferring ore from **Burner Mining Drill** to **Furnace**\n- **Inserter** at position (-14.5, -53.5) transferring ore from **Burner Mining Drill** to **Furnace**\n\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore, transfer it to furnaces, and smelt it into iron plates. The furnaces are currently idle due to a lack of iron ore.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like **Burner Mining Drills** or **Wooden Chests**.\n- Example: Attempting to place a **Burner Mining Drill** without having it in inventory.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities without sufficient inventory\n- Always check your inventory before inserting items into entities like **Inserters** or **Furnaces**.\n- Example: Attempting to insert coal into an inserter without having coal in your inventory.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without sufficient resources or crafting machines\n- Ensure you have all required ingredients and access to the appropriate crafting machines (e.g., furnaces for smelting) before attempting to craft items.\n- Example: Attempting to craft **Iron Gear Wheels** without sufficient **Iron Plates** or a crafting machine.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid positions\n- Check for collisions with existing entities or invalid placement areas (e.g., water) before placing new entities.\n- Example: Attempting to place an inserter next to a chest but colliding with a nearby **Burner Mining Drill**.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without sufficient ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and the required ingredients (e.g., iron ore) before starting the smelting process.\n- Example: Furnaces are idle due to a lack of iron ore despite having coal.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills cannot drop items\n- Ensure the drop position of mining drills is clear and connected to a chest or belt to avoid warnings like \"chest at drop position is full.\"\n- Example: **Burner Mining Drill** at (-16.0, -54.0) has a full chest at its drop position.\n\n#### Errors when using incorrect API calls\n- Ensure API calls are correctly formatted and use valid parameters, such as proper entity positions and directions.\n- Example: Attempting to subscript a `BoundingBox` object directly instead of accessing its properties."}
