{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-0.5, 25.5) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 25.0) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5) (Status: WORKING)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at various positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 22.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (15.0, 0.0) (Status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Inserters at Positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) (Status: NO_POWER)\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (17.5, -0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that underground pipes are placed correctly and that their ends are not obstructed by other entities or terrain. Adjust the placement to ensure connectivity.\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Verify that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to the water supply and each other. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes that could interrupt the fluid flow.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Place electric poles within range to provide power to the inserters.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Supply\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain to ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnace."}
