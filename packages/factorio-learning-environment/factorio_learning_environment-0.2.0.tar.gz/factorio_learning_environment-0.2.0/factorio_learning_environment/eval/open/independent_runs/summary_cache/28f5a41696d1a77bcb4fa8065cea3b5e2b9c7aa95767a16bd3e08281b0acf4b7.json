{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of boiler (position -11.5, 25.0) and steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5). The boiler is responsible for heating water to produce steam, while the steam engine converts steam into mechanical energy, which can be used to generate electricity.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### Lab at position(x)\nConsists of lab (position x) which is used for research purposes.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nThis structure is responsible for pumping water from the ocean to the boiler for steam generation. \n\n### Small electric pole at position(-11.5, 26.5)\nThis structure is used to provide electricity to nearby entities, including the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nThis structure is used to smelt ores into plates.\n\n### Furnace at position(5, 5)\nThis structure is used to smelt ores into plates.\n\n### Pipe connections\nPipes are used to connect the boiler and steam engine for the transfer of steam and water.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to pick up pipes\n- Ensure you are at the correct position of the pipe before attempting to pick it up. If the pipe has already been removed or is not present, you will receive an error.\n\n### Errors when reconnecting boiler to steam engine\n- Verify that the positions you are trying to connect are valid and that there are no obstacles preventing the connection. Ensure that the pipes are placed correctly to allow for fluid transfer.\n\n### Errors when the lab is not receiving power\n- Check the connections of the electricity generator and ensure that all entities are properly connected to the power network. If the generator is not connected, the lab will not receive power.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. If the tile is occupied, you will not be able to place the new entity."}
