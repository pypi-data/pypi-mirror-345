{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components for water and steam transportation\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) (currently inactive due to no ingredients)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) (currently inactive due to no ingredients)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) (currently inactive due to no ingredients)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) with a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) for output storage\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) (currently empty)\n- Lab with no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into the boiler without having coal in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors with Full Output Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities such as chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full output storage.\n\n### Errors with Inactive Production\n- Ensure that all production facilities have the necessary ingredients to operate. Stone furnaces are currently inactive due to a lack of ingredients. Regularly supply them with the required resources to maintain continuous production."}
