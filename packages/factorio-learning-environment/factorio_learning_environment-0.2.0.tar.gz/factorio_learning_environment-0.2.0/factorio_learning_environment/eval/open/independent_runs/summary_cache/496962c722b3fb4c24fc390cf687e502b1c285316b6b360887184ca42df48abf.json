{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Station at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-23.5, -16.5) containing 112 coal\n\n###Iron Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) containing 583 iron ore\n\n###Iron Smelting Station at (-10.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0), both fueled with 23 coal each\n\n###Copper Processing Line at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0)\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n- Middle wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5) containing 380 copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving items from input chest to middle chest\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0) fueled with 50 coal\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Errors when placing inserters\n- Before placing a new inserter, verify that there isn't already an inserter at the target position\n- When using place_entity_next_to(), consider adjusting the spacing parameter if the default spacing results in conflicts\n- Check the direction parameter when placing inserters to ensure proper orientation for item movement\n\n###Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - implement regular fuel checking and refilling\n- Furnaces showing NO_INGREDIENTS status - ensure proper input material flow through the production line\n- Inserters showing WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS - verify the supply chain is properly connected and supplied"}
