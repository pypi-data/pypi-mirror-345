Check the positions of the poles to confirm they can supply power.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors related to unpowered entities\n- Verify that all entities requiring power (like the lab and assembling machine) are connected to a power source and that the power source is operational."}
