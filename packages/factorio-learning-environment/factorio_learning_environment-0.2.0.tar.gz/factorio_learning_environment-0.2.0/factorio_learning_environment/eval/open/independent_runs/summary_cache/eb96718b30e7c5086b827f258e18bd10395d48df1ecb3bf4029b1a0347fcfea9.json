{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0)\n\nThis facility is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The stone furnace has been consistently refueled with coal and supplied with iron ore. It intermittently produces iron plates, which are extracted when available.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Placement\n- Ensure that the required item is available in the inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, the attempt to place a stone furnace failed initially because there was no stone furnace in the inventory.\n- The agent attempted to place a burner inserter at position (-9.0, -50.0) without having a burner inserter in the inventory. Always verify the availability of the entity in the inventory before placement.\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Ingredients for Crafting\n- Verify that all necessary ingredients are available before crafting. The agent could not craft a stone furnace initially due to a lack of stone.\n- The agent attempted to craft burner inserters and iron gear wheels without having enough iron plates. Ensure sufficient resources are gathered before crafting.\n- The agent repeatedly attempted to craft a burner mining drill without having enough iron plates and iron gear wheels. Ensure you gather the necessary resources before crafting.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity contains the item you wish to extract before attempting extraction. The agent encountered an error when trying to extract iron plates from the furnace because the furnace did not contain any iron plates at that time.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Inventory\n- Confirm that the items you wish to insert are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. The agent faced an error when trying to insert iron ore into the furnace without having iron ore in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Fuel without Inventory\n- Ensure that the fuel you wish to insert is present in your inventory before attempting to refuel an entity. The agent encountered an error when trying to insert coal into the furnace without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to Furnace Running Out of Fuel or Ingredients\n- Regularly check the fuel and ingredient levels in the furnace to ensure continuous operation. The agent experienced multiple instances where the furnace was out of fuel or lacked ingredients to smelt, leading to production delays. Consider maintaining a steady supply of coal and iron ore to the furnace.\n- The furnace frequently ran out of ingredients, causing production delays. Ensure a consistent supply of iron ore to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors due to Furnace Fuel Source Being Full\n- Monitor the furnace's fuel source to ensure it doesn't become full, which can prevent additional fuel from being added when needed.\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- The agent repeatedly encountered issues with crafting due to insufficient resources. Ensure that you gather enough resources, such as iron plates and iron gear wheels, before attempting to craft items like burner mining drills."}
