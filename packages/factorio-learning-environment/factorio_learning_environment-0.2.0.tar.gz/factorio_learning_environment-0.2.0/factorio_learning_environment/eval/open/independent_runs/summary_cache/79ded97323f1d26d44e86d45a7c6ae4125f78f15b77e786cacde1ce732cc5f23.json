{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position x=-15.0, y=-49.0) fueled by coal, currently processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Transport and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring items into an Iron Chest (position x=42.5, y=-80.5).\n- Wooden Chest (position x=40.5, y=-81.5) used for storage.\n- Iron Chest (position x=42.5, y=-80.5) used for storage.\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various positions for item transport:\n  - BeltGroup connecting positions (x=41.5, y=-85.5) to (x=41.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5) to (x=41.5, y=-82.5).\n  - Additional BeltGroups facilitating item movement across the map.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at position (40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=40.0, y=-84.0) extracting coal.\n- Transport Belts and Burner Inserters facilitating the movement of coal from the mining drill to storage or processing locations.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. For instance, the attempt to place a wooden chest at position (40.5, -82.5) failed due to an existing object.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- Verify the presence of the required entity at the specified position before attempting operations. For example, the error \"Could not get Prototype.WoodenChest at position x=42.5 y=-81.5\" indicates that the entity was not found at the expected location.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities. The error \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" suggests a lack of iron ore in the inventory."}
