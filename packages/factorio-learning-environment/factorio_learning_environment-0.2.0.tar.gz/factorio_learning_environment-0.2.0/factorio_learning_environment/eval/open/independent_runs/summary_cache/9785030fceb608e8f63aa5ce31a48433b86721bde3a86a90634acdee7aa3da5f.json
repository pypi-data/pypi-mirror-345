{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) which moves iron ore from the chest to another storage chest at position (-14.5, -46.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -48.5) which stores iron plates. It currently contains 1527 iron plates.\n\n### Secondary Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nThis facility is a backup or secondary smelting line for iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) which is currently not in use due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) which is waiting for source items to transfer to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. Check if the source chests or belts are adequately stocked and not blocked.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Belt at Drop Position Being Blocked\n- Ensure that the drop position for inserters is clear and that there is enough space for items to be placed. Regularly check and clear any blockages in the production line.\n\n### Incorrect Use of API for Inventory Inspection\n- When inspecting inventory, ensure that the first argument is an Entity or Position object, not an integer or any other type.\n\n### Errors with Coal Insertion\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into machines. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to avoid interruptions in production."}
