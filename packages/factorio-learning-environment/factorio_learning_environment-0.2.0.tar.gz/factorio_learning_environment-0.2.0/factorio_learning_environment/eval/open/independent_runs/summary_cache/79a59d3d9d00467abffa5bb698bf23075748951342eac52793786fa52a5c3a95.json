{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) fueled by coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) fueled by coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) fueled by coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) waiting for source items and transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5) generating electricity.\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0) fueled by coal and heating water.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions [(1.5, 2.5), (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 14.5), (1.5, 6.5), (1.5, 10.5)] providing power to connected entities.\n\n### Laboratory Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (2.5, 0.5) connected to the power network but not receiving power due to connection issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a valid source entity with items to pick up. Check the configuration of inserters to ensure they are correctly aligned with the source entity.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Blocked Outputs\n- Ensure that there is a valid destination entity for the inserters to place items into. Avoid placing items directly onto the ground without a receiving entity.\n\n### Errors with Research Initiation\n- Verify that the lab is properly connected to the power network and that there are sufficient science packs available for research initiation.\n\n### Errors with Power Connections\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the electricity network. Check the connections and ensure that there are no gaps in the power poles.\n\n### Errors with Item Insertion\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to insert them into another entity. Check the source inventory before performing an insert operation.\n\n### Errors with Connecting Belts to Furnaces\n- Use inserters to input items into furnaces instead of trying to connect belts directly to furnaces. Ensure proper use of inserters for item transfer."}
