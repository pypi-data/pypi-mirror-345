{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) for storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) moving items from furnace to chest\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of Transport Belts and a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Multiple BeltGroups facilitating the movement of copper ore from the mining drill to storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) for moving iron ore from chest to belt\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storing resources like coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure there are no gaps between belts when connecting them. Check the alignment and continuity of belts to avoid gaps at positions such as (-21.5, -65.5) and (-20.5, -65.5).\n\n### Fuel Management for Drills and Inserters\n- Regularly check and refuel Burner Mining Drills and Burner Inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Ingredient Supply for Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of ingredients to smelt. Address warnings like 'no ingredients to smelt' by maintaining a steady input of raw materials.\n\n### Inserter Operation\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Adjust their placement if they are waiting for source items without any available."}
