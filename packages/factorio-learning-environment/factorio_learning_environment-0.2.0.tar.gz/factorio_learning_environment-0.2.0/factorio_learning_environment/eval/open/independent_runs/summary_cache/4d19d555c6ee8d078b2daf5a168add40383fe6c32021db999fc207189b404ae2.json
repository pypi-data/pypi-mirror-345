Multiple attempts were made to craft and place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs; however, all such attempts failed. Although the agent interacted with existing furnaces (for smelting iron and copper plates) by retrieving them (e.g. at positions (5.0, 5.0) and (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)), these operations used pre\u2010existing entities rather than constructing a new structure.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Errors with get_entities\n  \u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. 'radius') or extra positional arguments.\n  \u2013 Confirm the function\u2019s signature and call get_entities with the expected parameters.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n  \u2013 Validate inventory before attempting to place a Lab to prevent errors such as \u201cNo lab in inventory.\u201d\n  \u2013 Check that the result of entity-retrieval calls is not None before iterating over it.\n  \u2013 Ensure that all prerequisite resources and sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are available or can be produced before attempting Lab crafting.\n  \u2013 Review and complete necessary production or smelting steps so that resource transformation processes meet the Lab\u2019s recipe requirements."}
