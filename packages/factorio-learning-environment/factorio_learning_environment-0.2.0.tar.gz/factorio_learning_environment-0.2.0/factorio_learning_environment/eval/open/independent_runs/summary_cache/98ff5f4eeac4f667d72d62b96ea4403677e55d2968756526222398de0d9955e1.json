{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-11.5, 69.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-11.5, y=69.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.5, y=72.0)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=76.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric poles distributing power\n\nThis structure generates electricity by pumping water from a water source, heating it in the boiler using coal to produce steam, which then powers the steam engine to generate electricity.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position(17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=17.5, y=72.5)\n- Wooden chest (position x=17.5, y=74.5) collecting iron ore\n- Inserter (position x=17.5, y=75.5) moving ore from chest\n- Stone furnace (position x=17.0, y=78.0) for smelting\n- Inserter (position x=18.5, y=77.5) for output from furnace\n- Inserter (position x=17.5, y=79.5) for moving items from furnace to belt\n- Transport belt (position x=17.5, y=80.5)\n\nThis structure mines iron ore, collects it in a chest, and attempts to process it into iron plates in the furnace.\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Assembly at Position(22.5, 79.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position x=22.5, y=79.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Inserter (position x=20.5, y=79.5) to feed iron plates into the assembler\n\nThis structure is set up to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, but is currently missing input materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to an assembling machine. Use an inserter as the target entity instead.\n- When connecting entities with belts, ensure there is a valid path between the start and end positions.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid locations\n- Check for existing entities or items on the ground before placing new entities.\n- Ensure the target location is valid terrain (not water) and has enough space for the entity.\n- When placing entities next to each other, adjust the spacing parameter if the default spacing results in collisions.\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- When using `place_entity_next_to()`, verify that the resulting position isn't already occupied.\n- Consider different directions or increased spacing when the default placement fails.\n- Check that the inserter's pickup and drop positions align with the intended source and destination entities.\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Ensure all electrical entities are connected to the power network via electric poles.\n- The report shows one inserter is not connected to power, which prevents it from functioning."}
