{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) fueled by coal. Currently has no ingredients to smelt and contains 51 iron plates.\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) which are not receiving electricity. These inserters are responsible for moving items between the furnace and adjacent chests.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage purposes.\n\n### Power Infrastructure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 18.5) and (-9.5, 23.5) which are empty, indicating a lack of fluid flow.\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, indicating a power grid setup. However, the voltage is currently 0, indicating no active power supply.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using undefined entities\n- Ensure that all entities such as 'mining_drill' and 'ore_chest' are defined and available in your current context before attempting to use them.\n\n### Errors in connecting power infrastructure\n- Verify the connectivity between pipes and ensure that all connections from the offshore pump to the boiler are correctly established. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes.\n\n### Errors when verifying power grid\n- Confirm the presence of steam engines at the specified positions to ensure they are correctly placed and connected to the power grid.\n\n### Errors due to existing entities\n- Before placing new entities like small electric poles, check if they already exist at the desired position to avoid duplication.\n\n### Errors due to inserters not receiving power\n- Ensure that all inserters are connected to a power source and that the power grid is active to avoid issues with inserters not functioning due to lack of electricity."}
