{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), currently working with energy 15000.0.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), currently out of fuel, with warnings of 'out of fuel'.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), currently working.\n- Pipe Group connecting the steam engine and boiler, with various pipes positioned between (x=3.5, y=17.5) and (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n- Pipe Group for water supply from the offshore pump, with pipes positioned between (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n- Electricity Group with poles positioned at various coordinates, providing electrical connectivity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the correct type of pipes (UndergroundPipe, Pipe) are used and that they are properly aligned to connect entities such as boilers and steam engines. Verify the positions and connection points before attempting to connect.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(boiler.steam_output_point, steam_engine, {Prototype.UndergroundPipe, Prototype.Pipe})`: Failed to connect due to incorrect pipe alignment or positioning. Ensure the entities are correctly positioned and the right types of pipes are used.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of pipes used for connecting entities.\n- `boiler`: Boiler entity at position (x=1.5, y=23.0).\n- `steam_engine`: Steam engine entity at position (x=17.5, y=20.5).\n- `offshore_pump`: Offshore pump entity at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)."}
