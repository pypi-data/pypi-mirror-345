Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities effectively. Adjust their position and direction as necessary."}
