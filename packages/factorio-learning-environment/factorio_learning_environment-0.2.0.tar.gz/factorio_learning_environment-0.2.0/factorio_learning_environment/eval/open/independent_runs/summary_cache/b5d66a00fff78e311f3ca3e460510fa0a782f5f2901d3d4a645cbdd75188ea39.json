{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled by coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to another storage chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing the produced iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution\nThis section is responsible for storing and distributing iron plates:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) storing various amounts of iron plates.\n\n### Additional Furnaces\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Inserters and Additional Storage\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-11.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) are set up for transferring items between entities but are currently waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -47.5) and (-6.5, -47.5) are set up for additional storage but are currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the necessary source items to function properly. Check the supply chain to ensure all necessary resources are available upstream.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Regularly check and realign inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned for picking up and dropping items.\n\n### Errors with Coal Supply\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and other coal-dependent entities. Monitor coal levels and replenish as necessary to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regular checks on the supply of raw materials to furnaces can prevent downtime.\n\nBy addressing these errors and maintaining a steady supply of resources, you can optimize the efficiency of your production lines."}
