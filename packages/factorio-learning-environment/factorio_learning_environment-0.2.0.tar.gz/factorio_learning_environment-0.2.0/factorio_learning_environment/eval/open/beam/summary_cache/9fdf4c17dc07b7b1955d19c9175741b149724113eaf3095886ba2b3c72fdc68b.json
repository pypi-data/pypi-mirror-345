{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Coal mine at position (40.5, -82.5)\nConsists of:\n- Coal deposit (position 40.5, -82.5)\n\n### Iron ore mine at position (-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of:\n- Iron ore deposit (position -15.5, -50.5)\n\n### Copper ore mine at position (unknown)\nConsists of:\n- Copper ore deposit (position unknown)\n\n### Stone deposit at position (60.5, -54.5)\nConsists of:\n- Stone deposit (position 60.5, -54.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to missing entities in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entities in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, you cannot place an offshore pump or stone furnace if they are not present in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. For example, you cannot place a stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) because that position is already occupied.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace. For example, you cannot insert iron ore or coal if they are not present in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when smelting\n- Check that you have enough fuel and ingredients for the smelting process. If there are no ingredients to smelt or the furnace is out of fuel, it will result in a smelting timeout error.\n\n### Errors when setting the recipe for the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace is correctly placed and operational before attempting to set its recipe. If no building is found, it indicates that the furnace may not be recognized.\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items that are not in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace. If you receive an error stating \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory,\" it indicates that you do not have the necessary items available.\n\n### Errors related to furnace inventory management\n- Regularly check the inventory of the furnace to ensure it has the necessary materials for smelting. If the furnace has insufficient materials, it may lead to errors during the smelting process.\n\n### Errors related to smelting timeout\n- Ensure that the furnace has enough fuel and the required input materials before starting the smelting process. If you encounter a smelting timeout error, it indicates that either the fuel or input materials are insufficient.\n\n### Errors when attempting to set the furnace recipe\n- Make sure the furnace is operational and correctly placed before trying to set its recipe. If you see an error stating \"No building found that could have its recipe set,\" it suggests that the furnace is not recognized or is not in a valid state.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient iron ore for insertion\n- Ensure that you have iron ore available in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. If you receive an error stating \"No iron ore available to insert into the furnace,\" it indicates that you do not have any iron ore to use."}
