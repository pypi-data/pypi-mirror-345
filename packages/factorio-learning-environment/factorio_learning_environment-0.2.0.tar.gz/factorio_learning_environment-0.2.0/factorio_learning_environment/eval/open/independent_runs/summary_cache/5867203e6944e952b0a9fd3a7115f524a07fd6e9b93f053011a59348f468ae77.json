{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and the Boiler to the Steam Engine\n- Electricity Group at position (-5.4, 20.0) which is not yet plugged into the electric network\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine. Check for any obstacles or misalignments in the expected pipe paths.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Make sure to keep the Boiler fueled with coal to maintain its operation. Regularly check and replenish the fuel supply as needed.\n\n### Errors in Electric Network Connection\n- Ensure that the Electricity Group is properly connected to the electric network. Verify the placement and availability of Small Electric Poles to facilitate this connection.\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Before attempting to place entities like Small Electric Poles, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory. Craft or gather necessary items beforehand.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended entity before attempting to place it."}
