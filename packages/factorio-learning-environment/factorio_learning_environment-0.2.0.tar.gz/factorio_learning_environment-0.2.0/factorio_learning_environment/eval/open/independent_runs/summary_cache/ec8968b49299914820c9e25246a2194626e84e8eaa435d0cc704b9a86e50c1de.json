{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of 50 coal. The furnace has warnings of 'no ingredients to smelt' and 'furnace fuel source is full', indicating it is not currently operational.\n\n### Pipe Group at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipes connecting positions (-12.5, 21.5), (-11.5, 21.5), (-11.5, 22.5), (-10.5, 22.5), (-10.5, 23.5), and (-9.5, 23.5). The pipe group is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric poles at various positions including (-7.5, 18.5), (-7.5, 17.5), (-8.5, 16.5), and others extending to (-3.5, 22.5), (-0.5, 22.5), (-1.5, 22.5). The electricity group is not currently operational as indicated by a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure there is a suitable water source available and that the offshore pump is placed adjacent to it. Repeated attempts to place the offshore pump failed due to unsuitable positions.\n\n### Errors in Boiler and Steam Engine Placement\n- Verify the terrain and space availability before placing boilers and steam engines. Attempts to place these entities at positions (-4.5, 24.5) and (0.5, 24.5) were unsuccessful due to unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Connection Failures Between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Multiple attempts to connect these entities failed, indicating possible misalignment or obstruction.\n\n### Electric Pole Connection Issues\n- Check the spacing and alignment of electric poles to ensure they can connect properly. Placement issues have prevented successful electric network connections.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Usage in API Calls\n- When picking up entities, ensure that the second argument is a valid Position object. An error occurred due to incorrect argument usage."}
