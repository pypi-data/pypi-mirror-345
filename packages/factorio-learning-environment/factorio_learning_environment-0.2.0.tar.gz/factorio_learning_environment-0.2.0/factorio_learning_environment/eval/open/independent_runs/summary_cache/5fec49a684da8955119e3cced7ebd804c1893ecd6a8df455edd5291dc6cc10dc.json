{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Connected Pipe Network facilitating fluid transport\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) storing iron ore\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) extracting iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) facilitating item movement between entities\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Copper Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs but currently no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into the boiler failed due to lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors While Setting Research\n- Ensure that research is properly configured and that the necessary science packs are available in the lab to initiate research.\n\n### Errors with Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement."}
