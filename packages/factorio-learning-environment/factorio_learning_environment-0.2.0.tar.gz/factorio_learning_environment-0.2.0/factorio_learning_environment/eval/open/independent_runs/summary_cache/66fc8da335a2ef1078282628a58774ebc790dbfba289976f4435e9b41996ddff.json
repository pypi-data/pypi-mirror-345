{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has not successfully placed any entities or constructed any structures based on the provided execution logs. \n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities like Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts is buildable. Check the terrain and clear any obstacles before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Make sure that there are enough resources available to supply to entities like Furnaces once they are placed. Ensure coal or other necessary resources are available and accessible.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the tile is not occupied by another entity or is not restricted for building before placing an entity. This will prevent placement errors and ensure efficient use of space.\n\n### General Inventory Management\n- Regularly check the inventory to ensure that you have the necessary items available for construction and expansion. Keep track of the number of each item to avoid running out during crucial building phases."}
