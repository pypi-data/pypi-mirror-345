{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) - Status: NO_FUEL / WORKING\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED / WORKING\n- Pipe Group connecting entities:\n  - Pipe at position (-4.5, 16.5) - Status: EMPTY / WORKING\n  - Pipe at position (-9.5, 23.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT / WORKING\n- Electricity Group at position (-6.625, 20.375) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fuel and Connection\n- Ensure the boiler has sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and insert coal or other fuel types as needed.\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Ensure there are enough pipes in inventory to complete these connections.\n\n### Errors with Inventory and Placement\n- Before attempting to place an entity, ensure it is available in your inventory. Craft or gather necessary items like small electric poles before placing them.\n- Check that the target position for placing entities is not already occupied by another entity to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network\n- Ensure that the electricity group is properly connected to the electric network. Place electric poles strategically to connect all necessary components.\n\n### General Connection Errors\n- When connecting entities, ensure that the connection path is clear and that the correct type and number of pipes are used. Craft additional pipes if necessary to complete connections.\n\n### Index Errors\n- When accessing lists or arrays, ensure that the index is within the valid range to avoid out-of-range errors."}
