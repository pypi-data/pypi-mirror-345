{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n\nThis setup is responsible for extracting iron ore and processing it into iron plates. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore and transfers it to the stone furnace, which then smelts the ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, the error \"Could not place burner-mining-drill at (-21.0, -52.0), No burner_mining_drill in inventory\" indicates a missing item in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing an entity is clear and valid. Errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the desired location\" and \"Cannot place Transport Belt at the desired location\" suggest that the chosen tile is already occupied or not suitable for placement.\n\n### Furnace not producing iron plates\n- Verify the setup of the furnace to ensure it has the necessary resources and fuel to operate. The repeated message \"The furnace is not producing iron plates. Check the setup\" indicates a potential issue with the furnace's configuration or resource supply.\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserters\n- Similar to other placement errors, ensure that the location for placing a burner inserter is valid and not occupied by another entity. The message \"Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location\" suggests an issue with placement."}
