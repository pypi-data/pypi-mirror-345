{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Boiler at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position x)\n- Pipe (position -24.5, -51.5)\n- Pipe (position -10.5, 23.5)\n- Pipe (position -2.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe (position -36.5, 29.5)\n\n### Assembling Machine Factory at position(y)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position y)\n- Small electric pole (position z)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to PipeGroup attributes\n- Ensure that you are accessing the correct attributes of the PipeGroup object. The error indicates that 'fluid_system' is not an attribute of the PipeGroup. Verify the documentation for the correct attributes available for this object.\n\n### Errors when pipes are not connected\n- Check the connections of the pipes to ensure they are properly linked to a fluid source. The boiler status indicates it is not connected, which suggests that the pipes may not be set up correctly. Review the layout and connection points of your piping system.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
