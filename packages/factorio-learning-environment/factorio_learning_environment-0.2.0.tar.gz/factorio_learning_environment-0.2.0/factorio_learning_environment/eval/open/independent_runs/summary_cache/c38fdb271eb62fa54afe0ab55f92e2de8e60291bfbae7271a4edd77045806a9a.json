For example, ensure coal is available before inserting it into an inserter or other machinery.\n\n### Chest Overcapacity\n- Regularly check and clear out chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. Specifically, ensure the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) is emptied to continue mining operations effectively."}
