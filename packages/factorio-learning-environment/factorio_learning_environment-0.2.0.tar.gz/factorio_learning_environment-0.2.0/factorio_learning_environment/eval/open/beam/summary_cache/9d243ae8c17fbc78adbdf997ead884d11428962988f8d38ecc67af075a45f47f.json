{"content": "Great! You've successfully placed the Offshore Pump. Now, let's continue setting up the power infrastructure by adding a boiler and a steam engine to generate electricity, and then connect these to the assembling machine.\n\n# Step 1: Place the Boiler\n- Move to a position close to the Offshore Pump.\n- Place the Boiler adjacent to the Offshore Pump to ensure it receives water.\n\n```python\nboiler_position = offshore_pump.position.down(1)  # Adjust position as needed\nboiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\n```\n\n# Step 2: Fuel the Boiler\n- Insert coal into the Boiler to start generating steam.\n\n```python\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=10)\n```\n\n# Step 3: Place the Steam Engine\n- Place the Steam Engine adjacent to the Boiler to convert steam into electricity.\n\n```python\nsteam_engine_position = boiler_position.right(1)  # Adjust position as needed\nsteam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=steam_engine_position)\n```\n\n# Step 4: Connect the Power Network\n- Use Small Electric Poles to connect the Steam Engine to the Assembling Machine.\n\n```python\n# Find the existing small electric pole\nsmall_pole = next((entity for entity in get_entities() if entity.name == \"small-electric-pole\"), None)\n\n# Connect the steam engine to the existing power network\nconnect_entities(small_pole, steam_engine, Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\n\n# Ensure the assembling machine is connected to the power network\nfinal_pole = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, assembling_machine.position)\nconnect_entities(final_pole, assembling_machine)\n```\n\n# Step 5: Verify Power Supply\n- Check the status of the Assembling Machine to ensure it is receiving power and can produce copper cables.\n\n```python\nfor entity in get_entities():\n    print(f\"Entity: {entity.name}, Status: {entity.status}\")\n```\n\nThis setup should provide power to your assembling machine, allowing it to operate and produce items as needed. If any issues persist, ensure all connections are correctly established and all components are properly fueled and positioned.", "summary_range": "[1-154]"}
