class AnthropicLMInvoker(BaseLMInvoker):
    '''A language model invoker to interact with Anthropic language models.

    Attributes:
        client (AsyncAnthropic): The Anthropic client instance.
        model_name (str): The name of the Anthropic language model.
        default_hyperparameters (dict[str, Any]): Default hyperparameters for invoking the model.
        valid_extensions_map (dict[str, set[str]]): A dictionary mapping for validating the content type of the
            multimodal inputs. The keys are the mime types (e.g. "image") and the values are the set of valid
            file extensions (e.g. {".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg"}) for the corresponding mime type.
        valid_extensions (set[str]): A set of valid file extensions for the multimodal inputs.
        tools (list[Tool]): Tools provided to the model to enable tool calling.
        response_schema (ResponseSchema | None): The schema of the response. If provided, the model will output a
            structured response as defined by the schema. Supports both Pydantic BaseModel and JSON schema dictionary.
        output_analytics (bool): Whether to output the invocation analytics.
        use_thinking (bool): Whether to enable thinking.
        thinking_budget (int): The tokens allocated for the thinking process. Ignored if `use_thinking = False`.
        output_thinking (bool): Whether to output the thinking token. Ignored if `use_thinking = False`.

    Input types:
        The `AnthropicLMInvoker` supports the following input types:
        1. Text.
        2. Image: ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", and ".webp".

        Non-text inputs must be of valid file extensions and can be passed as either:
        1. Base64 encoded bytes.
        2. Remote URLs, with a valid `http` or `https` scheme.
        3. Existing local file paths.

        Usage example:
        ```python
        text = "What animal is in this image?"
        image = "path/to/local/image.png"

        prompt = [(PromptRole.USER, [text, image])]
        result = await lm_invoker.invoke(prompt)
        ```

    Tool calling:
        Tool calling is a feature that allows the language model to call tools to perform tasks.
        Tools can be passed to the via the `tools` parameter as a list of LangChain\'s `Tool` objects.
        When tools are provided and the model decides to call a tool, the tool calls are stored in the
        `tool_calls` attribute in the output.

        Usage example:
        ```python
        lm_invoker = AnthropicLMInvoker(..., tools=[tool_1, tool_2])
        ```

        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(
            response="Let me call the tools...",
            tool_calls=[
                ToolCall(id="123", name="tool_1", args={"key": "value"}),
                ToolCall(id="456", name="tool_2", args={"key": "value"}),
            ]
        )
        ```

    Structured output:
        Structured output is a feature that allows the language model to output a structured response.
        This feature can be enabled by providing a schema to the `response_schema` parameter.
        The schema must be either a JSON schema dictionary or a Pydantic BaseModel class.

        Structured output is achieved by providing the schema name in the `tool_choice` parameter. This forces
        the model to call the provided schema as a tool. Thus, structured output is not compatible with:
        1. Tool calling, since the tool calling is reserved to force the model to call the provided schema as a tool.
        2. Thinking, since thinking is not allowed when a tool use is forced through the `tool_choice` parameter.
        The language model also doesn\'t need to stream anything when structured output is enabled. Thus, standard
        invocation will be performed regardless of whether the `event_emitter` parameter is provided or not.

        When enabled, the structured output is stored in the `structured_output` attribute in the output.
        1. If the schema is a JSON schema dictionary, the structured output is a dictionary.
        2. If the schema is a Pydantic BaseModel class, the structured output is a Pydantic model.

        # Example 1: Using a JSON schema dictionary
        Usage example:
        ```python
        schema = {
            "title": "Animal",
            "description": "A description of an animal.",
            "properties": {
                "color": {"title": "Color", "type": "string"},
                "name": {"title": "Name", "type": "string"},
            },
            "required": ["name", "color"],
            "type": "object",
        }
        lm_invoker = AnthropicLMInvoker(..., response_schema=schema)
        ```
        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(structured_output={"name": "Golden retriever", "color": "Golden"})
        ```

        # Example 2: Using a Pydantic BaseModel class
        Usage example:
        ```python
        class Animal(BaseModel):
            name: str
            color: str

        lm_invoker = AnthropicLMInvoker(..., response_schema=Animal)
        ```
        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(structured_output=Animal(name="Golden retriever", color="Golden"))
        ```

    Analytics tracking:
        Analytics tracking is a feature that allows the module to output additional information about the invocation.
        This feature can be enabled by setting the `output_analytics` parameter to `True`.
        When enabled, the following attributes will be stored in the output:
        1. `token_usage`: The token usage.
        2. `duration`: The duration in seconds.
        3. `finish_details`: The details about how the generation finished.

        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(
            response="Golden retriever is a good dog breed.",
            token_usage=TokenUsage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=50),
            duration=0.729,
            finish_details={"stop_reason": "end_turn"},
        )
        ```

    Thinking:
        Thinking is a feature that allows the language model to have enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks,
        while also providing transparency into its step-by-step thought process before it delivers its final answer.
        This feature is only available for certain models (As of March 2025, only Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and can be enabled
        by setting the `use_thinking` parameter to `True`.

        When thinking is enabled, the amount of tokens allocated for the thinking process can be set via the
        `thinking_budget` parameter. The `thinking_budget`:
        1. Must be greater than or equal to 1024.
        2. Must be less than the `max_tokens` hyperparameter, as the `thinking_budget` is allocated from the
           `max_tokens`. For example, if `max_tokens=2048` and `thinking_budget=1024`, the language model will
           allocate at most 1024 tokens for thinking and the remaining 1024 tokens for generating the response.

        When enabled, the `output_thinking` parameter can be set to `True` to store the thinking in the `reasoning`
        attribute in the output.

        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(
            response="Golden retriever is a good dog breed.",
            reasoning=[Reasoning(type="thinking", reasoning="Let me think about it...", signature="x")],
        )
        ```

        When streaming is enabled along with thinking, the thinking token will be streamed with the `EventType.DATA`
        event type.

        Streaming output example:
        ```python
        {"type": "data", "value": "Let me think ", ...}  # Thinking token
        {"type": "data", "value": "about it...", ...}  # Thinking token
        {"type": "response", "value": "Golden retriever ", ...}  # Response token
        {"type": "response", "value": "is a good dog breed.", ...}  # Response token
        ```

        When both thinking and tool calling are enabled, the `output_thinking` parameter is required to be `True`.
        Otherwise, feeding back the tool results to the model after the tool calls are executed would throw an error,
        as it\'s required by Anthropic.

    Output types:
        The output of the `AnthropicLMInvoker` is of type `MultimodalOutput`, which is a type alias that can represent:
        1. `str`: The text response if no additional output is needed.
        2. `LMOutput`: A Pydantic model with the following attributes if any additional output is needed:
            2.1. response (str): The text response.
            2.2. tool_calls (list[ToolCall]): The tool calls, if the `tools` parameter is defined and the language
                model decides to invoke tools. Defaults to an empty list.
            2.3. structured_output (StructuredOutput | None): The structured output, if the `response_schema` parameter
                is defined. Defaults to None.
            2.4. token_usage (TokenUsage | None): The token usage information, if the `output_analytics` parameter is
                set to `True`. Defaults to None.
            2.5. duration (float | None): The duration of the invocation in seconds, if the `output_analytics`
                parameter is set to `True`. Defaults to None.
            2.6. finish_details (dict[str, Any]): The details about how the generation finished, if the
                `output_analytics` parameter is set to `True`. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
            2.7. reasoning (list[Reasoning]): The reasoning objects, if the `use_thinking` and `output_thinking`
                parameters are set to `True`. Defaults to an empty list.
