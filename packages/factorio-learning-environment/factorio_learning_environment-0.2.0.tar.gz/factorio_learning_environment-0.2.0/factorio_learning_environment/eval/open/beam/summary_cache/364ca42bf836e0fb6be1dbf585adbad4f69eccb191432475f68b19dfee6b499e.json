{"content": "# The Burner Mining Drill has been placed successfully, but it is currently facing two issues:\n1. **No Fuel**: The drill is reporting \"EntityStatus.NO_FUEL\" and has 4 coal left, which means it needs more coal to operate effectively.\n2. **Waiting for Space in Destination**: The drill is also indicating that it is \"waiting for space in destination as the output is full.\" This means that the output area for the drill is blocked, and it cannot deposit the mined resources.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Add More Coal**: I will insert additional coal into the Burner Mining Drill to ensure it has enough fuel to operate.\n2. **Create a Storage Solution**: I need to place a storage container (like a chest) or a sink nearby to allow the drill to offload the mined resources.\n\n### Actions:\n1. **Insert More Coal**:\n   - I will insert 5 more coal into the drill to ensure it has enough fuel.\n\n2. **Place a Storage Container**:\n   - I will craft a wooden chest to store the mined resources. \n\n### Insert More Coal:\n```python\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, mining_drill_entity, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 more coal into the drill\n```\n\n### Craft a Wooden Chest:\n```python\n# Check if I have enough materials to craft a Wooden Chest\nchest_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.WoodenChest)\nassert inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Wood, 0) >= 4, \"Not enough wood to craft a Wooden Chest.\"\n\n# Craft the Wooden Chest\ncrafted_chest_amount = craft_item(Prototype.WoodenChest)  # Craft one Wooden Chest\nassert crafted_chest_amount == 1, \"Failed to craft a Wooden Chest due to insufficient materials.\"\n\n# Place the Wooden Chest near the drill\nchest_position = Position(x=-11.5, y=18.5)  # Positioning the chest next to the drill\nplace_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, position=chest_position)  # Place the chest\n```\n\n### Verify the Drill's Status Again:\nAfter performing these actions, I will check the drill's status again to ensure it is working properly and can deposit its mined resources. \n\n### Final Check:\n```python\nprint(f\"Drill status after adding coal and placing chest: {mining_drill_entity.status}, Warnings: {mining_drill_entity.warnings}\")\nprint(f\"Inventory after actions: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")\n``` \n\nLet's execute these actions and check the results.", "summary_range": "[1-24]"}
