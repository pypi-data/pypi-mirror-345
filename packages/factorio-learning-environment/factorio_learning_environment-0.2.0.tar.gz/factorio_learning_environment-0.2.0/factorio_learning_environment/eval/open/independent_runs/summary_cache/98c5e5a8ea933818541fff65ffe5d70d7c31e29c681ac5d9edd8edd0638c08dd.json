This structure was employed to boost the available iron plate count needed for advanced crafting tasks such as Lab production.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of a furnace used for processing copper ore (with coal) into copper plates. Its output supports the production of copper cables and other intermediate components required in multi\u2010tier crafting recipes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage \u2013 get_entities:\n  - Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) to prevent unexpected parameter errors.\n  - Supply arguments in line with the function\u2019s signature; do not pass positional arguments if none are expected.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting:\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab at a specific position (e.g., (0.5, 2.5)), confirm that the Lab item is available in the inventory.\n  - Validate that all sub-ingredient dependencies (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available and that their production chains are fully supported by available machines or furnaces.\n\n\u2022 Handling Non-Iterable Returns:\n  - When functions like get_entities may return None, incorporate a fallback (such as defaulting to an empty list) before iterating to avoid TypeErrors.\n\n\u2022 Resource Conversion Dependencies:\n  - Ensure that necessary raw materials (iron ore, copper ore, coal) are properly processed in the respective furnaces so that intermediate products meet the requirements for subsequent crafting recipes."}
