{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Furnace** at position (61.0, -54.0)\n  - Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Fueled by coal with 6 units remaining.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)\n  - Out of fuel and unable to continue mining because the chest at drop position (40.5, -83.5) is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5)\n  - Contains 159 units of coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (44.5, -83.5)\n  - Contains 650 units of coal and 300 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Storage Facility\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (61.5, -52.5)\n  - Contains 10 stone bricks, 6 wood, 650 coal, and 5 stone.\n\n### Transportation Network\n- Multiple **BeltGroups** connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of resources across the map.\n\n### Inserters\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (62.5, -53.5)\n  - Fueled with 24 units of coal, waiting for source items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (50.5, -49.5)\n  - Out of fuel, waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management\n- **Full Inventory Issues**: Multiple attempts to store items in chests failed due to full inventory. Regularly check and clear inventory space to avoid blockage.\n- **Crafting Failures**: Crafting attempts failed due to full inventory. Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before crafting.\n\n### Resource Gathering\n- **Harvesting Failures**: Unable to harvest iron ore due to full inventory. Ensure inventory has space before attempting to gather resources.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- **Failed Placement**: Attempted to place burner-inserter at an occupied or unplaceable location. Verify the placement area is clear and suitable before placing entities.\n\n### Resource Supply\n- **Supply Failures**: Unable to supply furnaces with iron ore due to lack of iron ore in inventory. Ensure resources are available before attempting to supply structures.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the quantity of items like 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'stone-furnace', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `entities`: List[Entity] - Represents entities on the map, including their positions, statuses, and inventories."}
