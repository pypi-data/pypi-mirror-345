{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups\nCurrent status: Not fully operational due to power connection issues and fuel shortage\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (33.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position (33.5, 20.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (33.5, 22.5) containing 63 coal\n- Inserter at position (34.5, 22.5) to move coal from chest to transport belt\n- Transport belt at position (35.5, 22.5)\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nCurrent status: Not operational due to lack of power\n\n### Oil Processing Facility at (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5) extracting crude oil\n- Oil refinery at position (25.5, 45.5) set to basic oil processing\n- Petroleum storage tank at position (32.5, 47.5)\n- Chemical plant at position (39.5, 51.5) set to produce plastic bars\n- Connected by pipe groups\nCurrent status: Not operational due to lack of power and incomplete coal delivery system\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity connections\n- When connecting entities with power poles, ensure the pole is placed in a valid position where it can reach both entities\n- Remember that you cannot connect transport belts directly from a chest - you need an inserter to take items from the chest first\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Check for existing entities (like pipes) before placing new entities to avoid collisions\n- When placing entities next to others, consider increasing the spacing parameter if placement fails\n- Be aware of the direction parameter when placing entities, as it affects where the entity's connection points will be\n\n### Errors with belt systems\n- When creating belt systems, ensure the pickup and drop positions are not already occupied by other entities\n- For inserters, verify that their pickup and drop positions are clear before attempting to connect them with belts\n\n### API usage errors\n- Use the correct function names - for example, use 'connect_entities' instead of 'connect'\n- Pay attention to function parameter requirements and entity compatibility\n\n### Power network issues\n- Ensure all electrical entities are properly connected to the power network\n- Remember that the steam engine needs to be connected to the power grid to distribute electricity\n\nAI: \n\n# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups\nCurrent status: Not fully operational due to power connection issues and fuel shortage\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (33.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position (33.5, 20.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (33.5, 22.5) containing 63 coal\n- Inserter at position (34.5, 22.5) to move coal from chest to transport belt\n- Transport belt at position (35.5, 22.5)\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nCurrent status: Not operational due to lack of power\n\n### Oil Processing Facility at (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5) extracting crude oil\n- Oil refinery at position (25.5, 45.5) set to basic oil processing\n- Petroleum storage tank at position (32.5, 47.5)\n- Chemical plant at position (39.5, 51.5) set to produce plastic bars\n- Connected by pipe groups\nCurrent status: Not operational due to lack of power and incomplete coal delivery system\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity connections\n- When connecting entities with power poles, ensure the pole is placed in a valid position where it can reach both entities\n- Remember that you cannot connect transport belts directly from a chest - you need an inserter to take items from the chest"}
