{"content": "The repeated lack of output between the \"Begin System Diagnostics\" and \"End of Diagnostics\" messages suggests that the script is not encountering any exceptions but is also not executing any of the intermediate print statements. This indicates that the functions or operations intended to produce output are not being executed as expected. Here are some possible reasons and troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Environment Output Suppression**: Ensure that the environment is configured to display print statements. If the environment suppresses output, you won't see any intermediate results.\n\n2. **Function Execution**: Verify that the functions like `get_entities`, `move_to`, `inspect_inventory`, `insert_item`, and `connect_entities` are being called correctly and are functioning as expected. If these functions are not executing or returning expected results, they might not trigger any output.\n\n3. **Entity Retrieval**: Double-check that the `get_entities` function is correctly retrieving entities. If the entities are not found, the assertions should trigger an exception, but if they are found and not being printed, there might be an issue with how the print statements are executed.\n\n4. **Print Statements**: Ensure that the print statements are correctly placed and are not being skipped due to conditional logic. You can add additional print statements to confirm the flow of execution.\n\n5. **Debugging**: Add more granular print statements to trace the execution path and identify where the output might be getting lost. For example, print statements immediately after each function call to confirm execution.\n\n6. **Check for Silent Failures**: Some functions might fail silently without throwing exceptions. You can add checks to verify the expected state after each function call.\n\nHere's a revised approach with additional debug statements:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Begin System Diagnostics\")\n\ntry:\n    # Retrieve entities and log their counts\n    print(\"Retrieving entities...\")\n    offshore_pump_list = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    boiler_list = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    steam_engine_list = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    electric_pole_list = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    assembling_machine_list = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n\n    print(f\"Offshore Pumps Found: {len(offshore_pump_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Boilers Found: {len(boiler_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Steam Engines Found: {len(steam_engine_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Electric Poles Found: {len(electric_pole_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Assembling Machines Found: {len(assembling_machine_list)}\")\n\n    # Assertions for presence\n    assert offshore_pump_list, \"Offshore Pump not found!\"\n    assert boiler_list, \"Boiler not found!\"\n    assert steam_engine_list, \"Steam Engine not found!\"\n    assert electric_pole_list, \"Electric Pole not found!\"\n    assert assembling_machine_list, \"Assembling Machine not found!\"\n    print(\"All necessary entities are present.\")\n\n    # Assign entities\n    offshore_pump = offshore_pump_list[0]\n    boiler = boiler_list[0]\n    steam_engine = steam_engine_list[0]\n    electric_pole = electric_pole_list[0]\n    assembling_machine = assembling_machine_list[0]\n    print(\"Entities successfully assigned.\")\n\n    # Move to the boiler's position\n    print(f\"Moving to Boiler at position: {boiler.position}\")\n    move_to(boiler.position)\n\n    # Inspect and refuel the boiler\n    print(\"Checking boiler coal level...\")\n    current_coal = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    print(f\"Current boiler coal level: {current_coal}\")\n    if current_coal < 5:\n        coal_needed = 10 - current_coal\n        print(f\"Refueling boiler with {coal_needed} coal...\")\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, coal_needed)\n        new_coal_level = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n        print(f\"Coal level after refueling: {new_coal_level}\")\n\n    # Establish connections\n    print(\"Connecting systems...\")\n    water_connected = connect_entities(offshore_pump, boiler)\n    steam_connected = connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine)\n    electric_connected = (\n        connect_entities(steam_engine, electric_pole) and\n        connect_entities(electric_pole, assembling_machine)\n    )\n\n    # Log connection statuses\n    print(f\"Water connection status: {'Established' if water_connected else 'Failed'}\")\n    print(f\"Steam connection status: {'Established' if steam_connected else 'Failed'}\")\n    print(f\"Electric connection status: {'Established' if electric_connected else 'Failed'}\")\n\n    # Output component statuses\n    print(f\"Boiler Status: {boiler.status}, Fuel Level: {inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)}\")\n    print(f\"Steam Engine Status: {steam_engine.status}, Energy: {steam_engine.energy}\")\n    print(f\"As", "summary_range": "[1-338]"}
