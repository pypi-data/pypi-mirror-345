{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures present on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces, but these attempts have been unsuccessful. As a result, no structures have been established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the desired location for placing entities such as Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests is not occupied by other entities or obstacles. Verify the area is clear before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors related to the setup not producing iron plates\n- Double-check the connections and configurations of your mining and smelting setup to ensure they are correctly aligned and operational. Make sure all necessary entities are in place and functioning.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect use of API or entity specifications\n- When defining or using entity specifications, such as the BuildingBox dimensions for the Burner Mining Drill, ensure they are appropriate for the available space. Consider using smaller BuildingBoxes or adjusting the size to fit the available area.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move closer to the target entity from which you want to extract items before attempting the extraction.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- If the system reports missing entities like Stone Furnaces, verify that they have been placed on the map correctly. If not, ensure you have the necessary resources and space to place them."}
