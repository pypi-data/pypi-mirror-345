{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a status of 'out of fuel' and warnings indicating that the chest at drop position is full.\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing 415 iron ore.\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a status of 'working' and warnings indicating that the furnace result is full. It is currently processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing 661 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to insufficient fuel for Burner Mining Drill**: \n  - Ensure that there is enough coal in the player inventory to refuel the Burner Mining Drill before attempting to operate it.\n  \n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**: \n  - Empty the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue mining.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace result is full**: \n  - Check the output inventory of the Stone Furnace and ensure that the result can be stored. If the output chest is full, clear it to allow further processing.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - None defined or invoked.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: type: int, assigned: 0 (not enough coal in inventory)\n  - `iron_ore`: type: int, assigned: 9 (current inventory)\n  - `iron_plate`: type: int, assigned: 100 (inventory in the furnace)"}
