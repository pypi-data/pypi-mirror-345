{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore Pump and Pipe System at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5) connected to a Pipe at position (-47.5, -122.5), part of fluid system 74558.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) fueled by coal, with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) fueled by coal, with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) fueled by coal, with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Power Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (6.5, -60.5) and (6.5, -57.5), connected to power the inserter and lab.\n\n### Lab and Inserter Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the power network.\n- Lab at position (6.5, -57.5) connected to the power network but not receiving power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before attempting to place an entity. The steam engine placement failed due to an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors when Connecting to Power Network\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network. The failure to connect the small electric pole was due to missing items.\n\n### Errors with Entity Attributes\n- Avoid attempting to access non-existent attributes or methods on objects. The error with the 'Recipe' object indicates an attempt to access a non-existent attribute 'prototype'.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Ensure that all necessary resources and ingredients are available for entities to function correctly. The stone furnaces reported warnings of no ingredients to smelt, and the burner mining drill is out of fuel.\n\n### Errors with Electrical Connections\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are properly connected and receiving power. The inserter and lab were not receiving electricity, indicating a possible issue with the power network setup."}
