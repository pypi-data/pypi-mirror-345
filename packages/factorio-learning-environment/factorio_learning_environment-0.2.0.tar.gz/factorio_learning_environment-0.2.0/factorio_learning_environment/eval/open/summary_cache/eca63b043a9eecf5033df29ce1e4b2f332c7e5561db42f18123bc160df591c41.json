{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (23.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain from raw iron ore to iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal  \n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) transferring ore from the drill to the furnace, fueled with coal but currently waiting due to blocked furnace belt  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal but output is full causing blockage  \n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine, fueled with coal but waiting for space to output  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) crafting iron gear wheels from iron plates, currently not receiving electricity and thus non-operational  \n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) extracting iron gear wheels from the assembling machine, out of fuel and waiting for source items  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels output, currently empty  \n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) placed but not successfully connected to power the assembling machine and inserters  \n\nThis structure is powered by burner inserters fueled with coal. Coal is being harvested and inserted into drills, furnaces, and inserters, but frequent errors occur due to empty inventory during insertion attempts. The assembling machine remains without power due to failed electric pole connections.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to inserting items when inventory is empty  \n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into burner inserters and furnaces failed because the agent\u2019s inventory was empty at the time of insertion.  \n- Always verify that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into entities to avoid exceptions. Implement inventory checks or wait until items are harvested before insertion.\n\n### Errors from failed electric pole connections and missing power supply  \n- The electric pole at (21.5, 75.5) failed to connect to burner inserters and assembling machines due to missing required items in inventory.  \n- Ensure that enough small electric poles are available in inventory before attempting to place or connect them. Properly connect poles to cover all power-consuming entities to enable operation.\n\n### Errors related to blocked output and full inventories  \n- The burner inserter at (17.5, 71.5) is waiting because the furnace output belt is blocked. The furnace at (17.0, 73.0) has full output inventory, preventing further smelting.  \n- Design the layout to ensure continuous item flow and sufficient output capacity. Use inserters and belts correctly to avoid bottlenecks and blocked outputs.\n\n### Errors placing entities due to occupied tiles remain unresolved  \n- Previous issues with placing burner inserters and electric poles due to occupied or invalid tiles persist.  \n- Increase spacing or adjust entity placement strategy to find free tiles and avoid collisions.\n\nNAMESPACE  \nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent so far."}
