For example, you encountered errors when trying to insert coal and iron ore when you had none in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when using furnaces with full inventory\n- Avoid attempting to insert items into furnaces that are already full. Check the inventory status of the furnace before adding more items to prevent inventory full errors.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Make sure to check the production status of the furnace before attempting to extract items. If the furnace has produced nothing, you will not be able to extract items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile occupied by another entity\n- Ensure that the tile you are trying to place an entity on is not already occupied by another entity. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors when using furnaces with no ingredients\n- Check that you have the necessary ingredients to smelt before attempting to use the furnaces. You received warnings about having no ingredients to smelt in multiple furnaces.\n\n### Errors when using furnaces with insufficient fuel\n- Ensure that furnaces have enough fuel to operate. You received warnings about furnaces running low on fuel, which can halt production."}
