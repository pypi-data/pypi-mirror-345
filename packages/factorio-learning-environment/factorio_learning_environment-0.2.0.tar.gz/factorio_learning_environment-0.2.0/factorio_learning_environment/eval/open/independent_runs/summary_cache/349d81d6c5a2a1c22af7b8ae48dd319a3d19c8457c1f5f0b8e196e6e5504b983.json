{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n- No structures have been successfully created on the map as of the current steps.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable positions\n- Ensure that the target position is buildable before attempting to place an entity. Check for any obstacles or restrictions that might prevent placement.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operation\n- Verify that required resources, such as coal for furnaces, are available and supplied before attempting to use or place entities that require them.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Confirm that the tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. This includes checking for existing entities or environmental restrictions.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without checking global build restrictions\n- Always check for any global build restrictions that might affect the placement of entities, such as environmental settings or game rules.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities at incorrect coordinates\n- Double-check the coordinates for entity placement to ensure they are within the valid buildable area and not outside the map boundaries or in restricted zones."}
