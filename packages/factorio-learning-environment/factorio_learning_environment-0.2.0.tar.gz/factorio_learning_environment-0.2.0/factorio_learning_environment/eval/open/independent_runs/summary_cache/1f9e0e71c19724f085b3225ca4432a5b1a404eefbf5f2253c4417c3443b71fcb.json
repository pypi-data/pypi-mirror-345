{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine and boiler are currently not connected, while the offshore pump is operational.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions you are trying to connect are valid and not obstructed by other entities. Check the layout of existing pipes before attempting to reconnect.\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect (e.g., boiler and steam engine) are positioned correctly and within range to establish a connection."}
