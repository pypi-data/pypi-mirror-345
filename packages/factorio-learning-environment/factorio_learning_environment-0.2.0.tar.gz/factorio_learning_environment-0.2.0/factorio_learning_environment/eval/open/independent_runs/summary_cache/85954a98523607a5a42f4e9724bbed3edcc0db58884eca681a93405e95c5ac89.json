{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities are incomplete, leading to a lack of fluid flow.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel, also not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) intended to move items between entities but currently not powered.\n- Small Electric Poles intended to connect power to the inserter and other entities, but the network is incomplete.\n\n### Science Lab at Position (Lab Input)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs but not receiving power.\n- Connected to the same power network as the inserter, which is currently not functional.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to allow fluid flow. Verify the alignment and connectivity of pipes to prevent disconnection errors.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connection\n- Make sure all entities that require power are connected to a functional power network. Check that you have the necessary items (e.g., small electric poles) in your inventory to complete the power connections.\n- Verify that the power network is complete and that all poles are correctly placed to provide power to the necessary entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt. Regularly check inventories and supply lines to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Verify that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a powered network. Ensure that the power source (e.g., steam engine) is operational and connected to the network."}
