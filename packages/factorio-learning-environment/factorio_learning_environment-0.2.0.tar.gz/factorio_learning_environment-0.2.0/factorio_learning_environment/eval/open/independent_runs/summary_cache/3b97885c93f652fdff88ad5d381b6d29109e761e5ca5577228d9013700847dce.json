{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo permanent structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts were made to locate, craft, and place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but all such attempts failed due to resource shortages and inventory issues. No other built structures were identified in the logs.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors \u2013 When calling get_entities, arguments were misused:\n\u2003\u2013 An unexpected keyword argument \u201cradius\u201d was supplied.\n\u2003\u2013 Later, the call was modified to use positional arguments even though the function did not expect any.\n\u2003Tip: Always verify the function\u2019s signature and pass only the accepted parameters.\n\u2022 NoneType Iteration \u2013 An error occurred when attempting to iterate over a None value (existing_labs) when filtering for Lab entities.\n\u2003Tip: Check that the API call returns a valid (non\u2010None) collection before iterating.\n\u2022 Placement Failures \u2013 Several errors showed \u201cCould not place lab at (0.5, 2.5), No lab in inventory.\u201d\n\u2003Tip: Ensure that the required inventory items needed for placement are available before attempting to build a structure.\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Shortages \u2013 Multiple Lab crafting attempts failed due to missing sub-ingredients (for example, insufficient iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables).\n\u2003Tip: Verify that all necessary raw materials and intermediate products are available\u2014and that any prerequisite smelting or crafting steps have successfully completed\u2014before attempting to craft complex items like a Lab."}
