{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5) with status WORKING\n- Pipe groups connecting these entities, with some sections EMPTY and others FULL_OUTPUT\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, producing copper plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, producing copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, producing iron plates\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5) with status WORKING\n- Connected Pipe Group at position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, transporting water\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, with some poles not receiving electricity\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure there is no existing object at the target location before placing a pipe. Remove any obstructing entities first.\n\n### Errors with Picking Up Pipes\n- Verify the presence of a pipe at the target position before attempting to pick it up.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Water Supply\n- Ensure the boiler is properly connected to a water source. Check all pipe connections to ensure water can flow into the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to both the boiler and the electricity network to ensure it receives necessary inputs.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source to avoid the \"not receiving electricity\" status."}
