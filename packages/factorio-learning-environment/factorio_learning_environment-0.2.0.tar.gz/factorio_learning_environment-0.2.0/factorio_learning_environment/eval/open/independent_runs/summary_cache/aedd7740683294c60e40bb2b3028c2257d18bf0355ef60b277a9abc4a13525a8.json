{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Extraction System at (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of the burner inserter placed at (-3.5, 27.5) with a drop position at (-3.5, 28.5). This component serves as the resource extraction point feeding resources into the multi\u2010segment belt network.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at (\u22482.5, 17.5)\nConsists of the following interconnected entities:\n\u2013 Cable factory input chest at (2.5, 17.5)\n\u2013 New factory burner inserter at (2.5, 16.5)\n\u2013 Dedicated burner inserter placed at (3.5, 17.5) whose neighbors include an assembling machine at (1.5, 19.5)\nThis structure is designed to interface resource inputs with the copper cable production process.\n\n### Belt Depot at (3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Wooden chest serving as the belt depot at (3.5, 15.5)\n\u2013 Adjacent transport belt segment at (4.5, 15.5)\n\u2013 Depot burner inserter placed at (3.5, 14.5)\nIt functions as a consolidation and transfer point for resources coming from the extraction system via the transport belt network.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2013 When connecting transport belts, the target must be a valid inserter rather than a steam engine object. Repeated errors indicate that attempting to connect directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine causes failed connections; always ensure an inserter is in place to receive items.\n\n\u2013 Placement errors for entities such as the wooden chest have appeared. If placement fails because \u201cthe target position is too far away,\u201d move the player closer to the intended tile before attempting placement.\n\n\u2013 Ensure that required inventory items are available before placement. The \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d error shows a need to check inventory counts prior to executing placement commands.\n\n\u2013 Undefined variable issues (e.g. \u201cname 'target_chest' is not defined\u201d) should be resolved by verifying that all object references are properly defined and that variable names match the intended targets before use."}
