Verify that there are no missing pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Entities Not Connected to Power Network\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional electricity network. Check for any breaks in the electricity pole connections and ensure that the steam engine is operational.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that inserters are within range of powered electric poles. Verify that the electricity network is supplying power to the inserter.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Make sure that furnaces have the required ingredients in their inventory to process. Regularly check and supply the necessary raw materials to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Not Connected Fluid Systems\n- Ensure that all fluid systems are properly connected and that there are no gaps in the pipe networks. Check for any missing or misplaced pipes that could disrupt fluid flow."}
