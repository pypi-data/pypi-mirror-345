{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to two Wooden Chests at positions (x=52.5, y=-84.5) and (x=54.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- A network of transport belts connecting various positions for efficient ore movement.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items between chests.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System at Position (x=1.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) managing the transfer of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check and replenish the inventory of source entities if necessary.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnaces have the required raw materials to process. Ensure that the supply chain is feeding the necessary ingredients into the furnaces.\n\n### Errors When Chests are Full\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests to prevent overflow. Consider expanding storage capacity or improving logistics to handle excess items efficiently."}
