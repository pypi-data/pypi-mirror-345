{"content": "It seems that the output is not progressing beyond the initial print statement, \"Starting diagnostic procedure...\". This suggests that the script might be encountering an issue early in its execution, possibly during the retrieval of entities or an assertion failure. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Entity Retrieval**: Ensure that each call to `get_entities` is returning a non-empty list. If any of these lists are empty, the script will halt due to the `assert` statements. You can add additional print statements to verify the retrieval of each entity:\n\n    ```python\n    offshore_pump_entity = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    print(f\"Offshore Pump entities found: {len(offshore_pump_entity)}\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Verify Assertions**: The assertions are designed to ensure that each entity is present. If any assertion fails, it will raise an `AssertionError` and stop further execution. Verify that the entities are correctly placed in the game environment.\n\n3. **Exception Handling**: Ensure that any exceptions are being caught and printed. If the script is stopping without outputting an error message, it might be due to an unhandled exception. The current try-except block should catch most issues, but you can add more specific logging to identify where the script is failing.\n\n4. **Environment Setup**: Double-check that the Factorio environment is set up correctly and that all entities are placed as expected. Sometimes, the issue might be with the game state rather than the script itself.\n\n5. **Debugging Steps**: Add more granular print statements to track the script's progress and identify where it stops:\n\n    ```python\n    print(\"Attempting to retrieve Offshore Pump...\")\n    offshore_pump_entity = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    assert offshore_pump_entity, \"Offshore Pump not found!\"\n    print(\"Offshore Pump retrieved successfully.\")\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify where the script is encountering issues and take corrective action. If the problem persists, consider simplifying the script to isolate the problematic section.", "summary_range": "[1-308]"}
