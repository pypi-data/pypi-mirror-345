{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is currently fueled with coal and working.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transfers iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest. It is waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) stores iron plates transferred by Burner Inserter 1.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracts iron plates from the wooden chest and places them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connects from position (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates from the wooden chest to another wooden chest.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transfers iron plates from the transport belt to an end wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collects iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before placing a new entity. If an entity already exists at the desired position, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a transport belt. Direct connections from a chest to a belt are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to place or craft an entity, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory. For example, ensure you have enough wooden chests or wood to craft them.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required raw resources\n- Gather necessary raw resources, such as wood, before attempting to craft items that require them. Recipes for raw resources do not exist; they must be gathered manually."}
