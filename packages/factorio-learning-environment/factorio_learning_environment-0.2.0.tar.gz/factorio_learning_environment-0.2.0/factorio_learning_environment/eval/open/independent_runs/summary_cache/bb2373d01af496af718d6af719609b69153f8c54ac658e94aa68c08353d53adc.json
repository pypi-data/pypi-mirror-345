In every case, no matching pipe group was found. Ensure that the specified fluid_system identifier corresponds to an existing pipe group and that the search radius covers its location.\n- Consistency in Pipeline Network Parameters:\n  - Verify that the fluid_system identifiers are uniformly updated across interconnected entities (boiler, offshore pump, and all pipe groups). Inconsistencies in these parameters lead to aborted connection attempts.\n- Inventory Attribute Usage:\n  - Use only supported inventory attributes when accessing or modifying inventory items to prevent related errors."}
