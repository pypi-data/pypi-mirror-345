The chain comprises horizontal belt segments (expected at approximately (x=6.5, y=15.5), (x=7.5, y=15.5) and (x=8.5, y=15.5)) and vertical belt segments (expected at (x=8.5, y=14.5), (x=8.5, y=13.5), (x=8.5, y=12.5) and (x=8.5, y=11.5)).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Inventory and Dependency\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all required components (e.g., burner-inserters) are present in inventory before placement attempts. Craft missing items proactively to avoid errors such as \u201cNo burner_inserter in inventory.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Underground and Automated Connection Paths\n\u2003\u2013 When forming underground belt connections, maintain strict grid alignment and provide an unobstructed, continuous route between start and end points. Repeated \u201cNot a valid path to normalise\u201d errors indicate misalignment or segmentation issues.\n\u2003\u2013 Breaking connections into segments or using intermediate waypoints requires verifying that each segment adheres to grid constraints and connects directly to its adjacent segment.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Proximity\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the player is within the allowed placement radius for an entity. Errors stating \u201ctarget position is too far\u201d mean the player must move closer to the intended placement location before attempting to place transport belts or similar entities.\n\n\u2022 Sequential Connection Dependencies\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all prerequisite entities (such as target inserters and connection drops) are correctly placed and available before initiating any connection operations. Missing elements can lead to cascading failures in subsequent operations.\n\n\u2022 Fallback and Manual Approaches\n\u2003\u2013 When automated connection methods (underground belt links or fallback transport belt segments) repeatedly fail, consider manual placement. However, ensure that manual operations still respect grid alignment and proximity restrictions for successful placement.\n\nThis report integrates the unchanged structures with updated details for the Belt Connection Target Setup for Copper Extraction and highlights refined strategies to mitigate recurrent errors observed in recent execution steps."}
