{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (17.5, 20.5) with warnings for \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\".\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 23.0) with a warning for \"out of fuel\".\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) currently operational.\n- Pipe Group connecting various positions including (3.5, 17.5) and (8.5, 21.5).\n- Pipe Group with water fluid system at position (-9.5, 23.5) indicating \"FULL_OUTPUT\".\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions including (35.5, 24.5) and (27.5, 26.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Steam Engine and Boiler Connections\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of steam. Check the pipe connections and ensure there are no breaks or misalignments.\n- Verify that the boiler is adequately fueled to maintain steam production.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Confirm that all pipes are correctly connected to allow fluid flow from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine. Misaligned or disconnected pipes can prevent fluid transfer.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined in the current steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `fluid_system_2563`: Represents a pipe group with status EMPTY.\n- `fluid_system_2574`: Represents a pipe group with status FULL_OUTPUT and contains water.\n- `electricity_group_4797`: Represents an electricity group with a list of pole positions and voltage level."}
