{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled with coal\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal, currently with full input and output inventories\n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5), all fueled with coal, moving items between mining drill, furnace, assembling machine, and chest; some inserters are waiting due to blocked belts or full destinations\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, currently not receiving power and with zero energy\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty\n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters; however, the assembling machine remains unpowered\n- Electricity group formed by the poles at (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) with zero voltage, indicating no active power source connected\n\nNo new structures have been added or removed since the previous report.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent assembler power issues\n- The assembling machine 2 remains unpowered despite multiple attempts to connect it to small electric poles.\n- Verify that at least one power source entity (e.g., steam engine, solar panel) is placed and connected to the electric poles network.\n- Ensure electric poles are properly placed to form a continuous power network linking the power source to the assembling machine and inserters.\n- Check for correct electric pole coverage radius and that no gaps exist in the power network.\n- Avoid relying solely on poles without an active power source; placing poles alone does not supply power.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters and other entities\n- Multiple errors occurred when attempting to insert coal into burner inserters due to insufficient coal in inventory.\n- Although coal was harvested and inserted into mining drill and furnace, the inventory was often empty or lacked coal when inserting into burner inserters.\n- Ensure the agent manages coal inventory carefully, harvesting and transferring coal before attempting to fuel burner inserters.\n- Avoid attempting to insert coal when inventory is empty or depleted; implement inventory checks before insertion commands.\n\n### Errors placing offshore pump due to missing inventory\n- Attempt to place offshore pump at water position failed because no offshore pump was available in inventory.\n- Confirm required entities exist in inventory before attempting placement.\n- Plan entity usage and inventory management to avoid running out of critical structures needed for expansion.\n\n### Errors related to blocked inserters and full inventories\n- Inserters report waiting due to blocked belts or full furnace output inventories.\n- Ensure downstream entities (e.g., chests or assemblers) have capacity to accept items.\n- Maintain clear item flow paths to prevent backups that halt production.\n\n### General placement and power connection tips (from previous report)\n- Always confirm target tile is free before placing entities.\n- Use inserters between furnaces and belts; do not connect belts directly to furnaces.\n- Verify assembling machines have power by checking pole connections and power source availability.\n- Manage coal and fuel resources proactively to keep burner entities operational.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
