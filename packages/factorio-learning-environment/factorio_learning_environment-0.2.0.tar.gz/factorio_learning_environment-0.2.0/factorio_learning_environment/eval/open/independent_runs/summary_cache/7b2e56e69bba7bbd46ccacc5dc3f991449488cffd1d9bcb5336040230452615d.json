{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5), not connected to power network, no input liquid.\n- Boiler at position (x=5.5, y=27.0), not connected, no input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5), working, connected to pipes.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=0.5, y=30.5), working, connected to pipes.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pumps to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0), no ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserter at position (x=17.5, y=0.5), waiting for source items, not connected to power network.\n- Inserter at position (x=16.5, y=0.5), not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=18.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting various components, some with fluid (water) and others empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Electricity Connection\n- Ensure that all electrical components, such as steam engines and inserters, are connected to the power network to function properly.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Make sure that boilers and steam engines have the necessary fluid connections to operate. Check that pipes are correctly placed and connected to supply water to the boilers.\n\n### Errors with Placement of Entities\n- Avoid attempting to place pipes or other entities on tiles that are already occupied by another entity to prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Resource Supply\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt, and that inserters have access to source items to avoid operational warnings.\n\n### Repeated Connection Attempts\n- Repeatedly reconnecting entities without resolving underlying issues such as missing fluid or power connections will not solve the problem. Address the root cause to ensure proper functionality."}
