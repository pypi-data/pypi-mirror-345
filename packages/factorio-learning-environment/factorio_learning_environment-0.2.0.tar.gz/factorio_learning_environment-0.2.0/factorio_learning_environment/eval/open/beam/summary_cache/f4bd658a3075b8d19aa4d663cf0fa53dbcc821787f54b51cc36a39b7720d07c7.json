{"content": "The attempt to insert coal into the second existing furnace has encountered an error due to using a `Position` object instead of the furnace entity itself. The `insert_item` function requires a reference to the furnace entity, not just its position.\n\n### Current State Overview:\n- **First Existing Furnace**: \n  - Holds **9 pieces of iron ore** and is currently **working**.\n  \n- **Second Existing Furnace**: \n  - Holds **2 iron plates** and is in a **\"NO_INGREDIENTS\"** state, unable to smelt anything.\n  \n- **Newly Placed Furnace**: \n  - Holds **0 coal** and is also in a **\"NO_INGREDIENTS\"** state.\n\n### Immediate Next Steps:\n1. **Retrieve the Second Existing Furnace Entity**: Instead of using its position, I need to get the actual furnace entity to interact with it.\n2. **Insert Coal into the Second Furnace**: Once I have the correct reference, I can insert the remaining coal into the second furnace.\n\n### Let's retrieve the second existing furnace entity correctly and then attempt to insert coal into it.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Retrieve the second existing furnace entity using its position\nsecond_existing_furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, second_existing_furnace_position)\n\n# Insert the remaining coal into the second existing furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, second_existing_furnace, quantity=1)\n\n# Check the updated inventory of the second existing furnace after the insertion of coal\nupdated_second_furnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(second_existing_furnace)\nprint(f\"Updated inventory of the second existing furnace after inserting coal: {updated_second_furnace_inventory}\")  # Check furnace contents\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after all actions: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states again.", "summary_range": "[1-326]"}
