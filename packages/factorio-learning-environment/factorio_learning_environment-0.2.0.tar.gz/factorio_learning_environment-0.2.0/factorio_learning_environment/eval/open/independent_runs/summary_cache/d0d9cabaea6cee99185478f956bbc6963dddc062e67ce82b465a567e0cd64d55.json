{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Collection and Distribution System at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) to transfer coal from the chest to the transport belt.\n- Transport belt at position (42.5, -83.5) for moving coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) for transferring coal to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional coal storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from position (41.5, -83.5) to (43.5, -83.5) and outputs from position (44.5, -83.5) to (46.5, -83.5), facilitating coal transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be achieved by checking the inventory of the source entity and ensuring it is not empty."}
