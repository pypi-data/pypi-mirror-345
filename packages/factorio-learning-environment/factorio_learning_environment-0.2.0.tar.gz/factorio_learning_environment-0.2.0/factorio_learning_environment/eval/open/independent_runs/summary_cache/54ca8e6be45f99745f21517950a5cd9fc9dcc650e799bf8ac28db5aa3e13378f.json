{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), which is currently out of fuel.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0), which is currently out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), which is currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined resources.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0), which is currently out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storing resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal when none is available in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to entities being out of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of your mining drills and furnaces to ensure they are operational. Replenish fuel as needed to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Without ingredients, the furnace will not function even if it has fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: A function used to insert items into entities. It failed when attempting to insert coal into a drill without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity.\n- `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity."}
