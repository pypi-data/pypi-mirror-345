{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Plate Production Line at y=1.0\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel with automated output collection:\n- Stone furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) - actively smelting iron ore with coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) - actively smelting iron ore with coal as fuel\n- Burner inserter at position (1.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from first furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (3.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from second furnace\n- Collection chest at position (2.5, 3.5) - central collection point for iron plates\n\nCurrent status:\n- First furnace: 32 coal, 6 iron ore, 26 iron plates\n- Second furnace: 42 coal, no iron ore, 23 iron plates\n- Both inserters have 19 coal each but are still blocked due to output pathing issues\n- Collection chest is empty\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Check inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Ensure you have crafted or collected the required items before placement\n\n### Errors when placing entities in invalid locations\n- Verify the target location is valid before placing entities\n- Some locations may be blocked by other entities or terrain\n- Consider checking if the target position overlaps with existing structures\n- Use appropriate spacing between entities to avoid placement conflicts\n\n### Errors with inserter output pathing\n- Ensure inserters have a valid destination container within reach of their drop position\n- Configure inserter drop positions to align with container input positions\n- Check that inserters are properly oriented towards their target containers\n- The current setup still shows inserters being blocked despite chest realignment - verify the exact drop positions (1.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 3.5) align with chest input positions\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without inventory\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting insertion operations\n- Collect necessary resources before attempting to refuel or supply entities\n- Keep track of inventory contents to prevent failed insertion attempts\n- Double check inventory contents before attempting to insert items into machines\n\n### Errors with resource management\n- Keep track of resource quantities in inventory\n- Ensure sufficient resources are collected before attempting to supply multiple machines\n- Consider collecting additional resources when inventory runs low on critical items"}
