{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: None (out of fuel warning)\n  - Status: No fuel, chest at drop position is full\n  - Drop position: (-14.5, -48.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Contains: 7 units of iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Fuel: 4 units of coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Pickup position: (-12.5, -48.5)\n  - Drop position: (-14.5, -48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: 6 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning suggests alignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the burner mining drill and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel. This will ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to avoid it being full, which can halt the mining process. Ensure that the chest has enough space to accommodate mined resources.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to smelt. Check the inserter setup and resource flow to the furnace to avoid interruptions in production."}
