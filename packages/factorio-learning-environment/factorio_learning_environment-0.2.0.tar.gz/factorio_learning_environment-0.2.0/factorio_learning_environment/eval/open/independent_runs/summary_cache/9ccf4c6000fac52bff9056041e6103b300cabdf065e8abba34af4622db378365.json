{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, currently inactive due to no ingredients.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5).\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) connected to the stone furnace, not receiving electricity.\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) connected to another wooden chest at position (18.5, 0.5), not receiving electricity.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 18.5) with multiple connected pipes, currently empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 23.5) with multiple connected pipes, currently empty.\n\n### Electrical Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (15.5, 2.5), (17.5, -0.5), etc., but currently with no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Mining Drills\n- Ensure the target position is clear and suitable for placing a mining drill. Consider expanding the search area or adjusting the BuildingBox size if placement fails.\n\n### Errors in Power Infrastructure Setup\n- Verify the connection between pipes and ensure all components like offshore pumps and boilers are correctly aligned and connected.\n\n### Errors with Existing Entities\n- Before placing a new entity, check if a similar entity already exists at the desired position to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors in Power Connection to Inserters\n- Confirm the presence of a steam engine at the specified position and ensure all power connections are correctly established.\n\n### Errors with Ore Chest Placement\n- Ensure that ore chests are placed correctly and defined within the system to avoid disruptions in resource collection.\n\n### General Entity Placement and Inventory Management\n- Regularly check the map for stale or incorrect entity data and update configurations as necessary to maintain operational efficiency."}
