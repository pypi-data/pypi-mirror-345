{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-21.0, y=-62.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt' and currently producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, y=-65.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-20.5, y=-66.5) connecting transport belts to the furnace at position (-19.0, y=-65.0).\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-17.5, y=-64.5) connecting the furnace at position (-19.0, y=-65.0) to a wooden chest at position (-16.5, y=-64.5).\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting various components within the facility.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-23.0, y=-68.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel', connected to transport belts and wooden chests.\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-23.5, y=-69.5) and (-24.5, y=-67.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the mining drill to storage chests.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (53.0, y=-83.0) working and connected to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (52.5, y=-84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-14.0, y=-53.0) working and connected to transport belts.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, y=-54.5) with a warning of 'output blocked by item on the ground'.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the mining drill to the inserter and further along the production chain.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, y=0.0) with warnings of 'no ingredients to smelt' and 'furnace fuel source is full'.\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (1.5, y=0.5) and (3.5, y=0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (2.5, y=0.5) with a warning of 'inserter waiting for source items'.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts to furnaces\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are properly initialized and have valid attributes. The error \"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'\" suggests that one or more entities involved in the connection are not correctly set up.\n\n### Inserter Output Blockage\n- Make sure there is a valid destination for inserter outputs. The warning 'output blocked by item on the ground' indicates that the inserter cannot place items because the destination is full or missing.\n\n### Fuel Management for Mining Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel. The warning 'out of fuel' for the burner mining drill indicates that it has stopped working due to lack of fuel."}
