{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) with coal as fuel and currently working status.\n- Wooden Chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) for storing resources, currently has coal in its inventory.\n- The drill has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5) where it deposits mined resources.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) which is currently in a NO_INGREDIENTS status and has coal as fuel. It has produced iron plates in the past.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting into the furnace with no ingredients**: Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt before attempting to insert items.\n- **Errors when the burner mining drill is full**: The warning indicates that the chest at the drop position is full. Empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to continue mining.\n- **Repeatedly inserting iron ore into the furnace**: Avoid inserting iron ore into the furnace when it is already in a NO_INGREDIENTS status to prevent unnecessary actions.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus"}
