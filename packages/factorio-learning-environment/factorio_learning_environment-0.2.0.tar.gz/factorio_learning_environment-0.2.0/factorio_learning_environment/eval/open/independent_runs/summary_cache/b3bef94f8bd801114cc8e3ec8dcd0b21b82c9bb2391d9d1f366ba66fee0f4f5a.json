{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) for inserting items\n- The facility is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore.\n\n### Coal Processing Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) for inserting items\n- The facility is responsible for processing coal and producing iron plates.\n\n### Additional Iron Processing Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) for additional iron plate production\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0) for additional iron plate production\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. This can prevent errors like \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and furnaces. For example, the chest at (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) need to be emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items to avoid errors related to being out of range."}
