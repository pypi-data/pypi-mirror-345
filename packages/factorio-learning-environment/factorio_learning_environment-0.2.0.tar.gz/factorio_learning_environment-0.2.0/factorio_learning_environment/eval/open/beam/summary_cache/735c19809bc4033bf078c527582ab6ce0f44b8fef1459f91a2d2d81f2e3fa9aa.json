{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at position (60.0, -55.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (60.0, -55.0)\n\nThe stone furnace is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Coal is used as fuel for the smelting process.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. In Step 2, the variable 'crafted' was not defined, which led to a NameError.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Verify the presence of items in the entity before attempting extraction. In Steps 7 and 9, attempts to extract iron plates from the stone furnace failed because the furnace did not contain the expected items.\n\n### Assertion errors due to mismatched expectations\n- Double-check the expected state of entities against their actual state. Steps 10 through 14 encountered AssertionErrors due to mismatched expectations of iron plate counts in the furnace. Ensure that the logic for counting or tracking items is accurate and aligns with the actual game state."}
