{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a transport belt system.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a transport belt system.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a transport belt system.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage at Position (x=1.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Belts\n- Ensure that the indices used for belt reconnection are within the valid range of the belt array. Double-check the connections and ensure that all belts are properly aligned and connected.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to source items. Check the supply chain leading to the inserters and ensure that the necessary items are available for them to operate.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement."}
