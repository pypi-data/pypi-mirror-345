{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which is actively mining iron ore. It is connected to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores the mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) which is intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates. However, it is currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues with the inserter.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=0.5) which is intended to transfer items from the stone furnace but is currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with their pickup and drop positions. Misalignment can cause items to not be transferred as intended. Regularly check and adjust the inserter positions to match the expected coordinates.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in all entities that require it (e.g., mining drills, inserters, furnaces). Refuel these entities regularly to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the setup of inserters feeding into the furnace. Misalignment or lack of fuel in the inserter can prevent iron ore from reaching the furnace. Regularly check the inserter status and realign or refuel as necessary.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel entities as needed. Running out of coal can halt operations and reduce efficiency."}
