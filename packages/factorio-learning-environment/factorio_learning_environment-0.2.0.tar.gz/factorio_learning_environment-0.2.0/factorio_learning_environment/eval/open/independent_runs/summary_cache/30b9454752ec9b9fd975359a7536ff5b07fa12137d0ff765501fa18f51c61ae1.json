{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 61.0, -52.0) with an inventory that includes coal and copper ore.\n\n### New Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 61.0, -52.0) with an inventory that includes copper ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before inserting it into the furnace. The furnace requires a minimum of 5 coal to operate.\n- Verify that you have enough raw materials (iron ore, copper ore) to insert into the furnace to avoid smelting timeouts.\n\n### Errors when harvesting resources\n- Make sure to be within reach of the resource you want to harvest. If nothing is within reach, you will not be able to harvest it.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Check the furnace inventory before inserting items to ensure it has enough capacity and that you have the required fuel and inputs.\n- Confirm that your inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into the newly placed furnace.\n- Ensure that you have copper ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has produced the items you are trying to extract. If the furnace has not smelted any items, you will not be able to extract them.\n\n### Errors when placing items into a new furnace\n- Confirm that your inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into the newly placed furnace.\n\n### Errors related to connecting entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to connect entities. Check your inventory before attempting to connect power sources to your furnace.\n\n### Errors related to crafting items\n- Ensure you have the necessary sub-ingredients in your inventory to craft items, such as copper plates for copper cables, before attempting to craft.\n\n### Errors related to smelting timeout\n- Check that you have sufficient fuel and inputs in the furnace. If the furnace is idle for too long due to lack of ingredients, it will trigger a smelting timeout error."}
