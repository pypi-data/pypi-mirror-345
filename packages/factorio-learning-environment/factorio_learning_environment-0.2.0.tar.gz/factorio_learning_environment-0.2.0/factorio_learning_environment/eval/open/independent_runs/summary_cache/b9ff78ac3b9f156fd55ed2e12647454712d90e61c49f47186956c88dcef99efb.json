{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-10, -59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 3 Burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), (-6, -59)\n- 3 Wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\nOnly middle mining drill is currently working, others need fuel\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 4 Stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0)\n- 4 Input burner inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- 4 Coal storage chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- 4 Output collection chests at positions (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- 1 Output burner inserter at position (0.5, 1.5)\nThe furnaces have fuel but are waiting for iron ore input. Some furnaces have produced iron plates stored in their output.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters in occupied spaces\n- Before placing inserters, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- The errors at positions (2.5, 1.0) and (2.0, 1.5) indicate attempts to place inserters where other entities already exist\n- Plan the layout carefully to ensure enough space between entities for inserters\n\n### Entity fuel management\n- Mining drills at the iron ore setup are out of fuel except for the middle one\n- Ensure all burner entities have a steady supply of fuel to maintain continuous operation"}
