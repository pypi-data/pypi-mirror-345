{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Operation at position(24.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest (23.5, -16.5) containing 266 coal\n\n###Iron Ore Mining Operation at position(-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest (-14.5, 21.5) containing 219 iron ore\n\n###Copper Ore Mining Operation at position(20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (20.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden chest (20.5, 21.5) containing 269 copper ore\n\n###Copper Smelting Setup at position(24.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (24.0, 20.0)\n- Input wooden chest (22.5, 21.5) containing 391 copper ore\n- Output wooden chest (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Burner inserter (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n- Burner inserter (22.5, 22.5) attempting to feed furnace from input chest\n\n###Unused Smelting Setup\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Incorrect Inserter Placement and Configuration\n- The inserter at (22.5, 22.5) is incorrectly positioned - its drop position (22.5, 23.5) doesn't align with the furnace input\n- When setting up inserter-furnace connections, ensure the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's input tile\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions match the intended source and destination entities before finalizing placement\n\n###Resource Management\n- Multiple furnaces are idle with \"no ingredients\" status - ensure proper input material flow\n- The furnace at (24.0, 20.0) has excess fuel (50 coal) while showing \"furnace fuel source is full\" warning - optimize fuel distribution\n\n###Entity Placement\n- The inserter at (22.5, 22.5) has a warning \"output blocked by item on the ground\" - ensure there's a valid destination entity for inserter outputs before placement"}
