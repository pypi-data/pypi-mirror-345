{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the updated report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n\n### Furnace Assembly at position (47.0, -80.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -80.0) facing UP\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT that connects belt to furnace\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) that feeds materials\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Placement and Rotation Issues\n- The stone-furnace entity cannot be rotated after placement - ensure correct orientation during initial placement\n- Consider the 2x2 size of furnaces when calculating placement positions\n- Align furnaces with inserter drop positions for proper material flow\n\n### Entity Blocking Issues\n- Transport belts getting blocked - ensure proper item flow and clearance\n- Inserters showing \"waiting for space in destination\" - verify target positions are clear and entities can accept items\n- Items on ground blocking output - ensure proper entity connections and material flow paths\n\n### Resource Issues\n- Mining drill showing \"out of fuel\" warning - maintain fuel supply in mining equipment\n- Furnace showing \"no ingredients\" warning - verify material supply chain is working\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- transport-belt: int (inventory count)\n- stone-furnace: int (inventory count)\n- wood: int (inventory count)\n- coal: int (inventory count)\n- iron-plate: int (inventory count)\n\n### Entity States\n- EntityStatus.NO_FUEL\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- EntityStatus.WORKING\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL\n\nThe logs show attempts to place and configure a furnace assembly with multiple positioning strategies, ultimately succeeding with a 2x2 size-aware placement at (47.0, -80.0)."}
