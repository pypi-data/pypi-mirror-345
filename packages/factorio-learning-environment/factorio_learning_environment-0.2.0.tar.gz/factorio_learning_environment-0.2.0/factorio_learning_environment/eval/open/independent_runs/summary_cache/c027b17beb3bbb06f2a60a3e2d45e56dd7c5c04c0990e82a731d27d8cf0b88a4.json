{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (-10.0, -48.0), currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -48.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5) and (-8.5, -47.5) managing material flow.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -46.5), (-7.5, -47.5), and (-6.5, -47.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Argument Type in Function Call\n- Ensure that when using functions like `inspect_inventory`, the first argument should be an `Entity` or `Position` object, not an integer or other data types.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities (e.g., inserting coal into a mining drill), verify that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid operation failures.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity for inserters has items available to be moved. Ensure that the production line is not stalled due to lack of input materials.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity for inserters has enough space to receive items. This may involve clearing output chests or ensuring that downstream processes are not blocked.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Regularly check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to continue production. This includes ensuring a steady supply of raw materials like iron ore."}
