{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler (position -13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5)\n- Connected with multiple pipes forming a fluid system.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) which is currently full and has copper-ore as input.\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0) which has coal as fuel and is producing iron plates.\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) set to produce automation science packs.\n- Currently has no power and cannot create automation science packs due to missing resources.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the item you want to extract. In the case of the copper plates, the furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) did not have a valid entity containing copper plates.\n\n### Errors when using assembling machines without power\n- Check the power connections to the assembling machine. The assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) is not receiving electricity, which prevents it from operating.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This is a common issue that can lead to failed actions.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
