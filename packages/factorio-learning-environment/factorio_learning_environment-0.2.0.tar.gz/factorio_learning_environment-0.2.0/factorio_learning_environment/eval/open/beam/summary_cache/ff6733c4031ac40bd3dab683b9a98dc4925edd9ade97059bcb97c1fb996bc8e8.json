{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load Copper Ore into the active furnace has produced the following results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now contains **2 pieces of Copper Ore** and continues to show **18 Iron Plates**.\n- The furnace is in a **\"WORKING\"** status, indicating that it has begun processing the Copper Ore.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **3 pieces of copper ore** remaining in the inventory.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is actively working on processing the Copper Ore, which is a positive outcome.\n- The remaining Copper Ore in the overall inventory is now **3 pieces**, which can be used for future smelting or crafting.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Monitor the Smelting Process**: Keep an eye on the furnace to ensure it completes the smelting of Copper Ore into Copper Plates.\n2. **Prepare for Further Production**: Consider gathering more resources or planning for additional crafting tasks while the furnace operates.\n\nLet's observe the furnace until it completes the smelting process and check the output. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Monitor the furnace for completion of smelting process\nwhile is_furnace_working(active_furnace):  # Check if the furnace is still working\n    pass  # Wait until the furnace finishes processing\n\n# After completion, check the output of the furnace\nfurnace_output = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the furnace output after processing\nprint(f\"Furnace output after smelting: {furnace_output}\")  # Display the output of the furnace after smelting\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after smelting: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory after smelting completion. \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-294]"}
