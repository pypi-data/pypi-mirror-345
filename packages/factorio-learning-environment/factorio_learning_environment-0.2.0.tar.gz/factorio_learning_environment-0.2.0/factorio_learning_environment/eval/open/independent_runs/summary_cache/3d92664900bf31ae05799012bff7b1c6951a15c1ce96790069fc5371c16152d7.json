{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Three stone furnaces at positions:\n  - Furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0)\n  - Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0)\n  - Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n- Burner inserters for feeding and extracting materials:\n  - Inserter at position (-17.5, -47.5) facing UP\n  - Inserter at position (-15.5, -47.5) facing UP\n  - Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) facing UP\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) for storing iron plates\n- Iron chest at position (-12.5, -44.5) for additional storage\n- Burner inserters for moving items between chests and belts:\n  - Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) facing DOWN\n  - Inserter at position (-13.5, -45.5) facing DOWN\n  - Inserter at position (-12.5, -45.5) facing DOWN\n  - Inserter at position (-14.5, -43.5) facing UP\n  - Inserter at position (-12.5, -43.5) facing UP\n  - Inserter at position (-13.5, -43.5) facing UP\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Transport belt connecting various components:\n  - Belt from position (-16.5, -46.5) to (-16.5, -48.5) in direction UP\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts to chests\n- Ensure that belts are not directly connected to chests. Use inserters to input items into chests.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters\n- Check for existing entities at the target position before placing an inserter. If an entity already exists, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors with invalid belt paths\n- Verify the path for transport belts is valid and can be normalized. Ensure there are no obstacles or incorrect connections in the intended path.\n\n### Errors with blocked inserter outputs\n- Ensure there is sufficient space and a valid destination for inserter outputs to prevent blockage."}
