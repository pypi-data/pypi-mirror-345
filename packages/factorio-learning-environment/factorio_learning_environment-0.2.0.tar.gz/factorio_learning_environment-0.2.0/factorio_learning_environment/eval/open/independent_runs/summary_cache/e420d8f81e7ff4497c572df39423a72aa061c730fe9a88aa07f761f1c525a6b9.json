Check the positions and ensure there are no obstructions or incorrect placements.\n\n### Errors with boiler connections\n- Verify that the boiler is properly connected to a water source through pipes. Ensure that the offshore pump is operational and that there are no breaks in the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the intended placement area."}
