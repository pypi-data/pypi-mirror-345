{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5), and steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5). The boiler is connected to the offshore pump via pipes, and the steam engine is connected to the electricity network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Lab at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a lab (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups located at various positions:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=19552, position=-9.5, -6.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=19559, position=-4.5, 19.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=19560, position=-15.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=19566, position=-18.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=19570, position=-21.5, 28.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=19569, position=-20.5, 29.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when removing pipes\n- Ensure that the correct syntax is used when accessing attributes of objects. For example, use `pipe.position` instead of `pipe[0]` or `pipe.x`.\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to manipulate has the appropriate attributes before attempting to access them.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
