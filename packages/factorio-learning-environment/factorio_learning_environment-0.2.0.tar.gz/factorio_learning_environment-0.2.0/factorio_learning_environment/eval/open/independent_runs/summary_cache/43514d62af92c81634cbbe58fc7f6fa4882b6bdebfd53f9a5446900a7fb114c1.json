{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (5.5, -60.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at Positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5) each containing iron plates\n- Iron Chest at Position (-3.5, -52.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -52.5), (-2.5, -52.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-15.0, -48.0) with warnings of being out of fuel and full furnace result\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -48.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt and full furnace result\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-11.0, -48.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from a Full Chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before attempting to extract items. Consider emptying the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors when Furnaces are Out of Fuel or Ingredients\n- Regularly check the fuel levels and ingredient availability for furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Refuel furnaces and supply necessary ingredients to avoid production halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] = {'wooden-chest': 2, 'coal': 65, 'iron-plate': 7569, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}"}
