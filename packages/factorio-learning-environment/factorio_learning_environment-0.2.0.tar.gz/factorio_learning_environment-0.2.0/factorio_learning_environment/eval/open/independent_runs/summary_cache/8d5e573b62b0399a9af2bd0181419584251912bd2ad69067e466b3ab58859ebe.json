{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5): Collects iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5): Stores iron plates produced by the furnace.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors related to furnace operation\n- **Furnace at (x=6.0, y=-63.0) has no ingredients to smelt**: Ensure that the furnace is supplied with iron ore and fuel (coal) to operate. Check the inserter and chest setup to ensure proper item flow.\n\n#### Errors related to inserter operation\n- **Inserter at (x=3.5, y=-61.5) is waiting for source items**: Verify that the chest at (x=2.5, y=-61.5) contains iron ore and that the inserter is correctly configured to transfer items to the furnace.\n\n#### General tips\n- **Monitor fuel levels**: Ensure that all burner entities (mining drills, furnaces, and inserters) have sufficient coal to operate.\n- **Optimize item flow**: Ensure that belts, inserters, and chests are properly aligned to avoid bottlenecks in production."}
