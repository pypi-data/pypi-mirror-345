{"content": "The error indicates that the player is too far from the target position to place the boiler. Let's address this by moving the player closer to the desired position before attempting to place the boiler.\n\nHere's how you can adjust the code:\n\n1. **Move Closer to the Target Position:**\n   - Before placing the boiler, ensure the player is within the allowable distance.\n\n2. **Re-attempt Placement:**\n   - Once in range, place the boiler and continue with the setup.\n\n### Updated Code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Move closer to the target position for the boiler\nboiler_position = offshore_pump.position.right()\nmove_to(boiler_position)\nprint(f\"Moved to position {boiler_position} to place the boiler.\")\n\n# Step 2: Place the Boiler\nboiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\nassert boiler, \"Failed to place Boiler.\"\n\n# Step 3: Ensure there's adequate coal for the boiler\ncoal_in_inventory = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\nif coal_in_inventory < 5:\n    move_to(nearest(Resource.Coal))\n    harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Coal), quantity=10)\n    print(\"Harvested additional coal.\")\n\n# Insert newly harvested coal into the Boiler\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=5)\n\n# Step 4: Place the Steam Engine next to the Boiler\nengine_position = boiler.position.right()\nsteam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=engine_position)\nassert steam_engine, \"Failed to place Steam Engine.\"\n\n# Step 5: Ensure electric connections are in place from the Steam Engine to the Assembling Machine\nconnected_poles = connect_entities(steam_engine, assembling_machine, Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nassert connected_poles, \"Failed to establish the electric connection.\"\n\n# Verify and print the current state of entities to ensure everything is set up correctly and powered\nprint(f\"Updated entities on the map after power setup: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- **Move Closer:** Always ensure the player is within the required distance for placing entities.\n- **Check Inventory:** Before attempting to place or insert items, verify that you have the necessary resources.\n- **Connect Power:** Ensure all entities that require power are connected to the power grid using electric poles.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully set up your power infrastructure and get the assembling machine running.", "summary_range": "[1-174]"}
