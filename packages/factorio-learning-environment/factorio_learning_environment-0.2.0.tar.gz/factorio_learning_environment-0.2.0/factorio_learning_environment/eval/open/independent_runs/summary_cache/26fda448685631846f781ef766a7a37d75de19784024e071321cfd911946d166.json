{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore, Iron Plate\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, Stone Furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all necessary entities such as mining drills and inserters. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Regularly extract items from storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full. This ensures that mining drills and other production entities can continue operating without interruption.\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Production\n- Monitor the furnace to ensure it has the necessary ingredients for smelting. If the furnace is not producing, check that it has both fuel and raw materials."}
