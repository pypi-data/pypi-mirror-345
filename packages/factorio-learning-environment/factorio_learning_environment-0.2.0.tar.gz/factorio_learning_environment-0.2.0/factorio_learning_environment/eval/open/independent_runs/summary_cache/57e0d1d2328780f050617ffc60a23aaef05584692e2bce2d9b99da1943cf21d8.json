{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) that supplies iron plates to a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) that supplies copper plates to a wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing extracted coal\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the wooden chest\n\n### Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities, including:\n  - Belt from position (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5)\n  - Belt from position (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. This will prevent errors like \"Could not place a wooden chest at x=13.5 y=0.5.\"\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This will prevent errors like \"Could not extract coal from wooden-chest at (40.5, -83.5): Could not find a valid wooden-chest entity containing coal.\"\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserter to function. This will prevent the inserter from waiting for source items, as seen at positions like x=1.5 y=0.5 and x=11.5 y=0.5.\n\n### Handling Full Chests\n- Regularly clear out full chests to prevent blockages and ensure continuous operation of inserters and mining drills. This will avoid warnings such as \"chest at drop position is full\" and \"chest is full\" for entities like the burner mining drill and inserters."}
