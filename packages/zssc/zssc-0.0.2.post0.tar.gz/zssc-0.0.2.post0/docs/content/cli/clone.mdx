---

Clone a remote repository to a local directory.

```sh
zssc clone url [--target_dir TARGET_DIR]
```

The priority of `TARGET_DIR` is:
1. Directory specified by `--target_dir`
2. Environment variable `GITHUB_ROOT`
3. Current directory

Supported URL schemes:
- `https://github.com/user/repo`
- `git@github.com:user/repo.git`
- `user/repo` (default to HTTPS)

<Callout title="HTTPS URL" type="info">
Suffixes of `.git`, `#`, and `?` will be ignored. For example,
```
https://github.com/user/repo.git
https://github.com/user/repo.git#branch
https://github.com/user/repo.git?ref=tag
```
will be all treated as
```
https://github.com/user/repo
```
