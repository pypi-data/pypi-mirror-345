{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15, -50) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14, -48) smelting iron plates\nCurrently working but output is blocked\n\n### Additional Iron Smelters\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- Position (0, 0)\n- Position (2, 0)\nBoth currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (4, 4)\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- Position (4, 4) with 30 copper plates in output\n- Position (6, 4) with 6 copper plates in output\nBoth currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, 24.5)\nComplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2, 23.5)\n- Steam engine at (9.5, 19.5)\n- Connected via pipe networks\n- Electric poles connecting to lab\nSystem is partially working but boiler needs fuel\n\n### Research Lab at (0.5, 8.5)\n- Lab with 7 automation science packs\n- Connected to power network but currently has no power\n- Researching automation technology\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Check inventory before attempting to insert items into machines\n- Ensure you have required raw materials before crafting\n- Gather required resources (like wood) before attempting to craft items that need them\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure you have the required entity in inventory before attempting to place it\n- When placing connected systems (like power or fluid), build and connect all required components\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Errors\n- Some items (like copper plates, iron plates) cannot be crafted directly - they need a furnace\n- Check all required ingredients and sub-ingredients before starting complex crafting chains\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Cannot use ModelPrivateAttr directly with integers (found in boiler width calculation)\n- When connecting entities, ensure you have all required connection items (like pipes) in inventory\n\n### Machine Operation Errors\n- Ensure machines have fuel before expecting them to operate\n- Check for blocked outputs on mining drills\n- Verify power connections are complete and working before expecting powered machines to function"}
