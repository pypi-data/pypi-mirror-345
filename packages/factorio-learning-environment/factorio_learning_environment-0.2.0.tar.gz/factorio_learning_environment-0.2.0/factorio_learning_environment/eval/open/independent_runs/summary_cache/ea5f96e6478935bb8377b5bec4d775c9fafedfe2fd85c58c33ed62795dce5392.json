{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore Pump and Fluid System at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-47.5, -123.5), connected to a fluid system.\n- Pipe at position (-47.5, -122.5).\n- Pipe at position (-48.5, -121.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Unspecified Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5).\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden chest at position (6.5, -59.5) with iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles forming a network at various positions, including (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5).\n\n### Laboratory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science packs but not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple pipe groups at various positions, including:\n- Pipe group at position (-47.5, -122.5) with water.\n- Other pipe groups at positions such as (-1.5, 11.5), (-0.5, 17.5), and (-12.5, 23.5), all empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Retrieving Entities\n- Ensure that the entity type and position are correct when using the `get_entity` function. The error \"Could not get Prototype.Boiler at position x=-46.5 y=-122.0\" indicates that no boiler was found at the specified position. Double-check the entity's existence and its coordinates before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that inserters are within the range of an active power source. The inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) is not receiving electricity, which can be resolved by connecting it to a powered electric pole.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. The furnaces at positions (-19.0, -73.0), (9.0, -64.0), and (6.0, -62.0) are not operational due to a lack of ingredients. Regularly supply the required materials to keep production ongoing."}
