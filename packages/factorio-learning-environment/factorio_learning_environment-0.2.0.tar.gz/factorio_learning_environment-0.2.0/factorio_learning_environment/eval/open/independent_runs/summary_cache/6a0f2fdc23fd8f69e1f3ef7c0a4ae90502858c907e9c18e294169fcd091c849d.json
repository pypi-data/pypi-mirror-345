{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Supply for Mining Drill\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled with coal for mining operations.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5) and (4.5, -58.5) for storing mined resources.\n- Warning: Chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5) is full, which may halt mining operations.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources or smelted products have sufficient space. Full chests can halt operations, as seen with the burner mining drill's warning about the full chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n\n### Efficient Resource Management\n- Regularly check and manage inventory levels in chests to prevent overflow and ensure continuous operation of mining and smelting processes.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore: int` - Represents the quantity of iron ore in the inventory, currently at 142 units.\n- `iron_plate: int` - Represents the quantity of iron plates in the inventory, currently at 5198 units.\n- `coal: int` - Represents the quantity of coal in the inventory, currently at 385 units."}
