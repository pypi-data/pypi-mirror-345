{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=43.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=40.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), and (x=43.5, y=-80.5) waiting for source items\n- Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) containing coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) containing coal\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (x=41.5, y=-78.5) and (x=41.5, y=-77.5) waiting for source items\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n- Additional Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-49.5) and (x=-9.5, y=-49.5) containing iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., chest or furnace) contains the items you are trying to extract. If the inventory is empty or the item does not exist, extraction will fail.\n\n### Errors When Transferring Items to Furnaces\n- Make sure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients and are not empty. If the furnace lacks ingredients, it cannot process the items, leading to transfer failures.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities connected to the inserters have the required items. If the source is empty, the inserters will remain idle waiting for items.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of space at the drop position."}
