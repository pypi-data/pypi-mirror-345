Regularly check your inventory and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Chest Overcapacity\n- Avoid overfilling chests. Ensure that the chest at the drop position is emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from halting due to full capacity.\n\n### No Ingredients for Smelting\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to smelt. Regularly check and supply the furnace with iron ore to maintain iron plate production.\n\n### Frequent Repositioning of Inserters\n- Minimize the need for repositioning and aligning inserters by planning the layout effectively. Ensure inserters are correctly positioned initially to streamline the transfer process from chests to furnaces."}
