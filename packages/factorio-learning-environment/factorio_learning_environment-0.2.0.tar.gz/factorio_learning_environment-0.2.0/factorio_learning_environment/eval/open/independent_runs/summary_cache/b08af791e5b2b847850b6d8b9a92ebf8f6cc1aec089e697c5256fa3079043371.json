{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (27.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (27.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-11.0, 20.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, 20.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (19.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position (13.5, 0.5) feeding the Assembling Machine\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the Assembling Machine\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (4.5, -0.5), (-3.5, 0.5), (4.5, 1.5), (12.5, 2.5), (-3.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (8.5, 5.5)\n- Inserters at various positions facilitating transfer between chests and other entities\n\n### Pipe and Electricity Networks\n- PipeGroup for steam and water distribution\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions providing power to entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Check for existing objects that might block placement.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be resolved by checking the inventory of source entities.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Make sure there is a destination entity or space available for the inserter to place its output. If the destination is full or blocked, the inserter will not function correctly.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers to maintain continuous operation. Lack of fuel will halt the energy production process.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Without ingredients, the furnace will not operate."}
