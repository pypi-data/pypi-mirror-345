{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) for transferring items between the drill, chest, and furnace.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron ore before smelting.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron plates after smelting.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting from empty chests\n- Ensure the chest has items before attempting to extract. Repeatedly extracting from an empty chest wastes actions and time.\n\n#### Errors with burner mining drill running out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner mining drill to avoid interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n#### Errors with inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to items to transfer. If the source chest is empty, the inserter will remain idle.\n\n#### Errors with furnace having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure a steady supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore) is provided to the furnace to maintain continuous production.\n\n#### Errors with placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Always verify that the target tile is free before placing an entity to avoid placement failures."}
