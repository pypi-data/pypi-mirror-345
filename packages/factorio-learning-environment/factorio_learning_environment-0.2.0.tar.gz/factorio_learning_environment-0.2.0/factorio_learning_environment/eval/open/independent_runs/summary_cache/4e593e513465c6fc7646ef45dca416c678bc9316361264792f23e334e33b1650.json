{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\n- Consists of multiple chests for storing and transferring iron plates:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-2.5, -52.5) with inventory {'iron-ore': 200, 'iron-plate': 1200} and a warning that the chest is full.\n  - Iron chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) with inventory {'iron-plate': 1476}.\n  - Several other wooden chests at positions (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -52.5), etc., used for inventory management.\n\n### Iron Ore and Plate Processing Area\n- Includes furnaces and storage chests:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with inventory {'iron-plate': 100} and a warning that the furnace result is full.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with inventory {'iron-plate': 100} and a similar warning.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with inventory {'iron-ore': 17, 'iron-plate': 100} and a similar warning.\n  - Associated chests for storing processed materials, such as the wooden chest at position (-15.5, -49.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\n- Consists of a burner mining drill and associated chests:\n  - Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with fuel inventory {'coal': 5} and a warning that the chest at drop position is full.\n  - Wooden chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), etc., for storing mined iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storage are not full to avoid warnings and interruptions in processing. Regularly transfer materials to less full chests or expand storage capacity.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from stopping production due to full output inventories. Consider automating the transfer of materials from furnaces to storage chests.\n\n### Mining Drill Output Full\n- Ensure that the output chests of mining drills are regularly emptied to prevent mining interruptions. Automate the transfer of mined resources to storage chests.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the logs provided.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_plate_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron plates across various chests.\n- `iron_ore_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron ore across various chests.\n- `coal_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal used for fueling furnaces and drills.\n\nNo utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided logs."}
