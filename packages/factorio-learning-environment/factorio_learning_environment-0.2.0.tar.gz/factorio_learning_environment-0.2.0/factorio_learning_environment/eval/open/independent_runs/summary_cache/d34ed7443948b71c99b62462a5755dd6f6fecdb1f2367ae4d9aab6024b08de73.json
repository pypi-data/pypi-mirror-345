{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 2.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 0.5, 1.5)\n\n### Lab at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 3.5, 0.5) which is currently not powered.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 2.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position 3.5, 0.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new poles\n- Ensure that you are not providing multiple values for the 'direction' argument when placing new poles. Check the function call to ensure that the parameters are being passed correctly.\n\n### Errors when the lab is not powered\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Check the electricity generator and ensure that it is functioning properly to provide power to the lab.\n\n### Errors when picking up obstructing entities\n- Make sure to check the area around you for any obstructing entities before attempting to pick them up. This can prevent unnecessary actions and streamline your workflow.\n\n### Errors when needing ingredients for research\n- Ensure you have the required ingredients in your inventory before attempting to complete research. In this case, make sure to gather enough automation science packs to complete the Automation research."}
