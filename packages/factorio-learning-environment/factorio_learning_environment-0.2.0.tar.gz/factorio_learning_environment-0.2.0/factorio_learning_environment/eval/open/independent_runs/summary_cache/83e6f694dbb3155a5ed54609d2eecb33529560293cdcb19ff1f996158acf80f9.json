{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Lab Facility at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to the electricity generator\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, connecting the steam engine to the lab and other entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough copper plates and wood before attempting to craft copper cables and small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connection\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like steam engines and labs with electric poles.\n- Ensure all necessary pipes are available and correctly positioned to connect the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Double-check the position and existence of entities like labs before attempting operations on them.\n\n### NameError in Code\n- Ensure all variables and constants are correctly defined and referenced in your code to avoid NameError exceptions.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Regularly check the status of entities like steam engines to ensure they are functioning as expected. If not, verify the connections and fuel supply.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Maintain a sufficient stock of coal to keep the boiler refueled and operational. Regularly mine more coal as needed."}
