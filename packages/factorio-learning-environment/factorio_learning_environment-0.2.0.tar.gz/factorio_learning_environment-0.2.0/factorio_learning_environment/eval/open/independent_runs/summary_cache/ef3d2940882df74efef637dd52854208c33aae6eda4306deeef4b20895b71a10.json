{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal, actively extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chests to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### New Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) connected to the ore supply, transferring iron ore to the furnace.\n\n### Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the production facility.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extract_item function\n- Ensure that the correct parameters are passed to the `extract_item` function. The `position` argument is not valid and should be omitted.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with insufficient spacing\n- When placing entities like inserters next to other structures, ensure there is enough space. If an entity already occupies the intended position, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid placement conflicts."}
