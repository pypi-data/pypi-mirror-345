{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) for mining iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) for transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) for storing smelted iron plates.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a full chest\n- Ensure the destination chest has enough space before attempting to extract items. The chest at (x=4.5, y=-61.5) is full, preventing further extraction of iron ore.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a chest with insufficient items\n- Verify the chest contains the required quantity of items before attempting extraction. The agent repeatedly tried to extract 800 iron ore from a chest that did not have enough items.\n\n#### Errors due to insufficient fuel in mining drills and furnaces\n- Ensure all burner-based entities (e.g., mining drills, furnaces) have sufficient fuel to operate. The burner mining drill at (x=2.0, y=-63.0) and the stone furnace at (x=4.0, y=-63.0) are out of fuel.\n\n#### Errors due to full furnace source inventory\n- Clear the furnace's source inventory if it is full. The stone furnace at (x=4.0, y=-63.0) has a full source inventory, preventing further smelting.\n\n#### Errors due to inserter destination being full\n- Ensure the inserter's destination (e.g., chest or furnace) has space to accept items. The burner inserter at (x=3.5, y=-61.5) is unable to transfer items because the chest at (x=4.5, y=-61.5) is full.\n\n#### General extraction errors\n- Double-check the entity and item type when using the `extract_item` function. The agent repeatedly attempted to extract iron ore from a chest that was either full or did not contain the required quantity."}
