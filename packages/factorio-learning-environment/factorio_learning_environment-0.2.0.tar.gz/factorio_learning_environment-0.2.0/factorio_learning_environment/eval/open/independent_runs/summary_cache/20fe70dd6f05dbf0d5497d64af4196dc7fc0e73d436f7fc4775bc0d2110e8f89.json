{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is designed to mine iron ore and smelt it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore. Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores mined iron ore. It contains 9 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is currently working but has a warning for being out of fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently, it is not receiving iron ore and has a warning for no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer materials between entities. Frequent repositioning indicates initial misalignment.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel all entities that require fuel, such as the burner mining drill and burner inserter, to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Ensure there is enough space in the chest for continuous mining.\n\n### Errors with Resource Flow\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to perform its function. Regularly check the setup to confirm the flow of resources from the chest to the furnace via the inserter."}
