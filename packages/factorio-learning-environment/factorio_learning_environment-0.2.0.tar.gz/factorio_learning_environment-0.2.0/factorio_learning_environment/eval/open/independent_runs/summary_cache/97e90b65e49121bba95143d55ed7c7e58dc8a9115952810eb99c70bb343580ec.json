{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Although the agent attempted to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), the placement failed due to missing inventory items. Other entities (such as furnaces used for smelting) were referenced during processing but were not newly created structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Parameters \u2013 When using get_entities(), ensure the call is made with the correct number and type of arguments. Avoid unsupported keywords (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and positional parameters if the function expects none.\n\u2022 Iteration Safety \u2013 Validate that functions returning entities do not yield a None value before iterating; this avoids errors like attempting to iterate over None.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting \u2013 Before placing a Lab, verify that the Lab is present in the inventory. For Lab crafting, confirm that all required sub-ingredients (e.g., iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper cables) and the necessary production facilities (such as furnaces or crafting machines) are available to meet recipe demands, thereby preventing cascading ingredient shortages."}
