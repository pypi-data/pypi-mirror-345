{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore supplied.\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace and a wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Transport belts connecting the furnace and chest, facilitating the movement of materials.\n\n### Iron Ore Supply Chain\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -45.5) working and waiting for source items, connected to the transport belts and the wooden chest.\n- Transport belts at various positions, facilitating the movement of iron ore and iron plates between chests and inserters.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple belts at positions such as (-16.5, -47.5) to (-16.5, -46.5), (-14.5, -46.5) to (-14.5, -47.5), and (-12.5, -46.5) to (-11.5, -46.5), directing the flow of materials throughout the facility.\n\n### Inserter and Chest System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner inserters at positions (-11.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), and (-14.5, -43.5), all waiting for source items or blocked, connected to transport belts and chests.\n- Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) currently empty, connected to the inserter and belt network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Inserter Blockage\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to drop items into their destination. Regularly check and clear blockages to maintain efficient operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the supply chain is intact and that source items are available for inserters to pick up. Ensure that all upstream processes are functioning correctly to provide necessary materials.\n\n### Errors with No Iron-Ore to Insert\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of iron ore in the inventory to avoid interruptions in the production process. Regularly check inventory levels and restock as necessary."}
