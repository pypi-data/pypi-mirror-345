{"content": "# The attempt to craft a stone furnace failed because we did not gather the necessary intermediate resource, which is stone. This is a common oversight when starting out, as players often forget to collect all required materials.\n\n## Next Steps:\n1. **Gather Stone**: We need to locate a stone patch and gather enough stone to craft the furnace.\n2. **Craft the Stone Furnace**: Once we have the stone, we can proceed to craft the furnace.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Locate the nearest stone patch.\n2. Move to the stone patch and gather a sufficient quantity of stone (let's say 10).\n3. Attempt to craft the stone furnace again.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n```python\n# 1. Locate the nearest stone patch.\nstone_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nmove_to(stone_position)  # Move to the stone patch location.\n\n# 2. Harvest some stone.\nharvest_resource(stone_position, quantity=10)  # Collect 10 stone from the patch.\nprint(f\"Inventory changed to {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory after gathering stone.\n```\n\n### Tips and Successful Patterns:\n- **Resource Management**: Always check what resources are needed for crafting before attempting to craft items. This helps avoid errors related to missing materials.\n- **Inventory Inspection**: Regularly inspect your inventory after each action to keep track of what you have and what you need next.\n- **Sequential Gathering**: Gather resources in a logical order based on crafting requirements. For example, gather stone before attempting to craft a stone furnace.\n\n### Example of Successful Patterns:\n- The earlier successful gathering of coal and iron ore demonstrates effective resource collection. Continuing this pattern with stone will lead to further success in crafting essential items.", "summary_range": "[1-8]"}
