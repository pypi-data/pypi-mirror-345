{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (x=0.5, y=2.5)\nConnected by pipes and power poles\n\n#### Oil Processing Facility\n1. Crude Oil Extraction:\n   - Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5)\n   - Connected to crude oil input tank (x=4.5, y=15.5)\n\n2. Oil Refinery:\n   - Oil refinery (x=9.5, y=15.5) set to Basic Oil Processing\n   - Connected to:\n     - Crude oil input tank (x=4.5, y=15.5)\n     - Petroleum gas output tank (x=14.5, y=15.5)\n\n3. Chemical Processing:\n   - Chemical plant (x=2.5, y=8.5) set to Sulfur recipe\n   - Petroleum gas input tank (x=-1.5, y=8.5)\n   - Sulfur output tank (x=6.5, y=8.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Fluid Connection Errors\n- Cannot connect to chemical plants or refineries without first setting a recipe\n- Ensure source entity has the correct fluid type before connecting (chemical plant expected petroleum gas but got crude oil)\n- Check fluid requirements of recipes before making connections\n\n#### Prototype Naming Errors\n- Use correct prototype names (PumpJack instead of Pumpjack)\n\n#### Entity Status Checks\n- Verify entity status before operations (refinery had FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE)\n- Storage tanks don't have .contents attribute - use appropriate methods to check fluids\n\n#### General Tips\n- Always check recipe requirements before setting up production chains\n- Verify fluid types match between connected entities\n- Monitor entity status indicators to detect production issues"}
