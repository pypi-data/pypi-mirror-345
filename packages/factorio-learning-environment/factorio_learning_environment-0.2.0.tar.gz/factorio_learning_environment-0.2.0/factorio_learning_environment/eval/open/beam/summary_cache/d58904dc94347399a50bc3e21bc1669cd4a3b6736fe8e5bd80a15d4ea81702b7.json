{"content": "It seems we have encountered another issue. The furnace is not functioning as expected, and our inventory does not reflect the iron ore we intended to use.\n\n**Current Inventory:**\n- 1 stone furnace (available)\n- 2 iron plates (produced)\n- 1 iron gear wheel (available)\n\n**Entities on the Map:**\n- We have multiple furnaces, but only one is working, and it appears to have 4 iron ore as its source, but we are not seeing the expected output.\n\n### Analysis\n1. **Furnace Status**: The working furnace has fuel and is processing iron ore, but it seems to have a discrepancy in the inventory tracking.\n2. **Iron Ore Count**: The iron ore count in the inventory does not match the expected amount after the insertion attempt.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo resolve this:\n1. **Check the working furnace** to see how many iron plates it has produced and if it has any remaining iron ore.\n2. **Inspect the inventory** of the working furnace to understand its current state.\n3. If necessary, we may need to gather more iron ore or adjust our setup.\n\nLet's inspect the working furnace to see its current inventory and status.", "summary_range": "[1-166]"}
