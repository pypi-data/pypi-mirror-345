{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Water Pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   OffshorePump at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### Coal Mine at x=16.0 y=0.0\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   BurnerMiningDrill at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) mining Coal.\n*   WoodenChest at position (x=16.5, y=1.5) receiving Coal from the BurnerMiningDrill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n*   Ensure you check if a tile is valid for placement before attempting to place an entity. Use functions like `can_place_entity` (with correct arguments) or `nearest_buildable` to find suitable locations, especially if direct placement fails. Avoid placing entities in locations occupied by other objects or invalid terrain.\n\n### Incorrect API Usage\n*   When using API functions like `can_place_entity`, ensure you are providing the correct arguments as expected by the function signature. Providing unexpected arguments (e.g., the 'exact' keyword argument) will result in errors. Consult the API documentation for correct usage."}
