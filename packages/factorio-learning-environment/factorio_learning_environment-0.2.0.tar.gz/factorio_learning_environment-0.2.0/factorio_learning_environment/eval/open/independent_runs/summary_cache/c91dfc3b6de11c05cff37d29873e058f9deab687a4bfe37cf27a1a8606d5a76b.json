{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0, 0) with an inventory containing 100 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) with an inventory containing coal (ranging from 547 to 554).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42, -83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42, -83) with a status of NO_FUEL.\n\n### Burner Inserters at positions (42.5, -80.5) and (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) waiting for source items, with an inventory containing 18 coal.\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) waiting for space in destination, with an inventory containing 1 coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15, -50)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15, -50) with a status of NO_FUEL.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting coal from the Wooden Chest**\n  - Ensure there is enough coal in the Wooden Chest before attempting to extract. The logs indicate that there was no coal available at times.\n  \n- **Errors with Burner Mining Drills being out of fuel**\n  - Regularly check the fuel status of Burner Mining Drills. They need fuel to operate, and the logs show multiple instances of them being out of fuel.\n\n- **Errors with Inserters waiting for items**\n  - Ensure that the source entities (like chests or furnaces) have the required items before the inserters are tasked to move items. The logs indicate that inserters were waiting for source items.\n\n- **Errors with Inserters waiting for space in destination**\n  - Make sure that the destination entities (like furnaces or chests) have space available for the items being inserted. The logs show inserters waiting for space in their destinations.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None invoked.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `stone_furnace_inventory`: dict\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: str\n  - `burner_inserter_status`: str\n  - `current_inventory`: dict"}
