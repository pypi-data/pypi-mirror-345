{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) - extracts crude oil (currently without power)\n- Storage tank at (22.5, 40.5) - stores extracted crude oil\n- Pipe network connecting pumpjack to storage tank (positions: (19.5,38.5), (18.5,38.5), (21.5,38.5), (20.5,38.5))\n\n### Partial Power Plant at (-8.5, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (-8.5, 20.0) - now operational with coal fuel and water connection\n- Offshore pump at (-11.5, 21.5) - connected to boiler via pipe network\n- Pipe network connecting water source to boiler (positions: (-6.5,21.5), (-6.5,20.5), (-11.5,22.5), (-8.5,22.5), (-7.5,22.5), (-6.5,22.5))\n\n### Secondary Boiler at (27.5, 41.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (27.5, 41.0) - currently non-functional (missing fuel and water input)\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (16.0, 21.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0, 21.0) - extracting coal\n- Wooden chest at (16.5, 23.5) - coal storage\n- Burner inserter at (16.5, 22.5) - transfers coal from drill to chest\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement distance errors (recurring)\n- Entities must be placed within 10 tiles of player position (occurred 4 more times)\n- When working with distant systems, plan movement between sites carefully\n\n### Obstruction errors (recurring)\n- Cannot place entities where pipes or other objects exist (occurred 3 more times)\n- Steam engines cannot be placed on water (occurred 1 more time)\n- Chest placement requires 1 empty tile around target position (occurred 2 more times)\n\n### Power plant construction (new)\n- Steam engine placement failed due to water obstruction - verify terrain heightmap before placement\n- Secondary boiler at (27.5,41.0) remains non-functional due to missing water connection\n\n### Inventory management (new)\n- Attempted to place boiler when none were in inventory (step 17) - always verify inventory before placement\n- Failed to insert coal into pumpjack - pumpjacks require electricity, not direct fuel insertion\n\n### System connectivity (recurring)\n- Pumpjack still lacks power connection - prioritize completing power plant\n- Verify all fluid connections when entities show \"no fluid present\" warnings\n\n### General tips (updated)\n- When crafting components (like boilers), verify successful crafting in inventory\n- For complex placements, check all surrounding tiles for obstructions including water\n- Complete one system (power plant) before moving to secondary projects\n- Verify entity power requirements (pumpjacks need electricity, not fuel)"}
