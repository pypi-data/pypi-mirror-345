{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5)\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5)\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel supply\n- The burner mining drill frequently runs out of fuel. Ensure to regularly supply coal to the burner mining drill to maintain its operation.\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Inserters are often waiting for source items or space in the destination. Check the inventory of the source and destination entities to ensure there is enough space and items available for the inserters to operate effectively.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. This includes checking if the target tile is already occupied by another entity.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `burner_mining_drill_position`: (float, float) - Position of the burner mining drill.\n- `wooden_chest_position`: (float, float) - Position of the wooden chest.\n- `burner_inserter_position_1`: (float, float) - Position of the first burner inserter.\n- `burner_inserter_position_2`: (float, float) - Position of the second burner inserter.\n- `stone_furnace_position`: (float, float) - Position of the stone furnace."}
