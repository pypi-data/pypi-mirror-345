{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Steam engine at position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Pipe group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and intended to connect to the steam engine\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-82.5) transferring coal to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Iron chest at position (x=42.5, y=-82.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) transferring materials to a wooden chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5)\n- Iron chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located at an unspecified position\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of:\n- Belt group with inputs and outputs facilitating coal transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between the boiler and the steam engine are correctly aligned and connected. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes that could prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to the source items they are supposed to pick up. Ensure that the source container or entity is correctly positioned and stocked with the necessary items.\n\n### Warnings of No Input Liquid and No Fluid Present in Connections\n- Check the fluid system connections to ensure that the steam engine is receiving the necessary input liquid. Verify that the pipes are correctly connected and that there is a continuous flow of fluid from the source to the engine.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the player, including items such as transport belts, pipes, and coal.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently present on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
