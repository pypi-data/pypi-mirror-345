{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal mining setup at position (30.0, 0.0)\nUpdated with functional production chain:\n- Burner mining drill at (30.0, 0.0) (active, producing 21 coal/minute)\n- Wooden chest at (30.5, 1.5) (contains 61 coal, directly receiving from drill)\n- Fuel system: 48 coal remaining in drill\n\n#### New coal mining setup at position (30.0, 20.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (30.0, 20.0) (active, producing 21 coal/minute)\n- Wooden chest at (30.5, 21.5) (empty, directly receiving from drill)\n- Fuel system: 19 coal remaining in drill\n\n#### Stone brick production at position (-50.0, 0.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n#### Coal distribution system at position (18.5, -0.5)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n#### Stone brick production line at position (21.0, 13.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Placement distance violations\n- Attempted to place drill at (30.0,20.0) from position (0,0) (distance 36.06 > max 10)\n- Solution: Always move within 10 tiles of target position before building\n\n#### Inventory mismanagement\n- Attempted to place steel chest without having any in inventory\n- Solution: Verify required items exist in inventory before placement attempts\n\n#### Expansion planning failures\n- Multiple failed attempts to find suitable expansion locations\n- Solution: Implement systematic location scanning with:\n  - Terrain verification\n  - Resource verification\n  - Distance validation\n\n#### Production monitoring best practices\n- Current successful systems:\n  - Fuel level tracking (48 units remaining)\n  - Output rate calculation (42 coal/minute total)\n  - Storage capacity monitoring (61/2000)\n- Expand to:\n  - Automated low-fuel alerts\n  - Full-chest detection\n  - Production logging\n\n#### Maintenance protocols\n- Implemented checks:\n  - Fuel verification (every 30 minutes)\n  - Output capacity checks\n  - Equipment health scans\n- Recommended additions:\n  - Automated maintenance scheduling\n  - Performance benchmarking\n  - Failure prediction systems"}
