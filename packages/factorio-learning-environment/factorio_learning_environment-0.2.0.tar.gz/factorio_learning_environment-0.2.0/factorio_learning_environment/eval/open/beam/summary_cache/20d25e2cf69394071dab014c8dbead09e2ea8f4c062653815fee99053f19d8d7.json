{"content": "The error indicates that the `available_furnace` variable is `None`, meaning that the code didn't find an idle furnace to use. This can happen if all furnaces are currently busy or if there was an issue with the furnace search logic. Let's address this by ensuring we have a valid furnace to work with:\n\n### Revised Steps:\n\n1. **Ensure Furnace Availability:**\n   - If no idle furnace is found, wait for the current furnace to finish processing and then reuse it.\n\n2. **Use Existing Furnace:**\n   - If no other furnace is available, use the existing furnace (`new_furnace`) once it becomes idle.\n\n3. **Handle Inventory and Fuel:**\n   - Ensure the furnace has the necessary fuel and copper ore.\n\n4. **Process Copper Ore:**\n   - Allow the furnace time to process the copper ore into copper plates.\n\n5. **Craft Required Items:**\n   - Once copper plates are available, craft the necessary items.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check if the current furnace is busy\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nif furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0) == 0 and new_furnace.status != EntityStatus.WORKING:\n    available_furnace = new_furnace\nelse:\n    # Wait for the current furnace to finish processing\n    sleep(20)\n    available_furnace = new_furnace\n\n# Step 2: Ensure the furnace has coal\nif furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) == 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, available_furnace, quantity=5)\n\n# Step 3: Insert copper ore\ncopper_ore_to_insert = 10 - furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0)\nif copper_ore_to_insert > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, available_furnace, quantity=copper_ore_to_insert)\n    print(f\"Inserted {copper_ore_to_insert} copper ore into the furnace.\")\n\n# Step 4: Wait for the furnace to process the copper ore\nsleep(20)\n\n# Step 5: Check the furnace's inventory for copper plates\nfurnace_inventory_after_processing = inspect_inventory(available_furnace)\ncopper_plates = furnace_inventory_after_processing.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\nprint(\"Furnace inventory after processing:\", furnace_inventory_after_processing)\n\n# Step 6: Extract copper plates and craft copper cables\nif copper_plates > 0:\n    extracted_copper_plates = extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, available_furnace.position, copper_plates)\n    print(f\"Extracted {extracted_copper_plates} copper plates from the furnace.\")\n\n# Step 7: Craft copper cables if copper plates are available\nif copper_plates > 0:\n    crafted_copper_cables = craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, quantity=1)\n    assert crafted_copper_cables > 0, \"Failed to craft copper cables despite available copper plates.\"\n\n# Step 8: Craft the small electric pole\ncrafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nassert crafted_poles > 0, \"Failed to craft small electric pole even with available materials.\"\n\n# Step 9: Place the small electric pole to provide power\npole_position = Position(x=4.5, y=2.5)\nelectric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, pole_position)\nassert electric_pole, \"Failed to place the small electric pole.\"\nprint(\"Successfully placed the small electric pole for power connectivity.\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Ensure Furnace Availability:** Check if the current furnace is idle before using it. If not, wait for it to become available.\n- **Fuel and Ore Management:** Ensure the furnace has the necessary fuel and copper ore before processing.\n- **Error Handling:** Use assertions to verify each step, ensuring that the process is working as expected.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully craft the required items.", "summary_range": "[1-134]"}
