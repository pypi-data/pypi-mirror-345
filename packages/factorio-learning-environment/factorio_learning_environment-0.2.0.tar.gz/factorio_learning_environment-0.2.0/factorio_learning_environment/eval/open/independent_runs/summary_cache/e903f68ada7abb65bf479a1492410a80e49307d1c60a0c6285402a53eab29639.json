{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions(-15.5, 19.5), (-16.5, 19.5), and (-19.5, 22.5)\n\n### Laboratory at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities (unchanged from previous report):\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities (unchanged from previous report):\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to research without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to research technologies. In this case, you need automation-science-pack to research electronics.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when lab is not powered\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source to avoid the \"no power\" status."}
