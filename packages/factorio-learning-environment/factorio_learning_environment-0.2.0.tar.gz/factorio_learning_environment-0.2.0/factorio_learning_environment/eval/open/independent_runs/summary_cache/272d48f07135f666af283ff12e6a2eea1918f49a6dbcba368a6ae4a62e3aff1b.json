{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Three stone furnaces located at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). These furnaces are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- A burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- A wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Additional wooden chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for general storage purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the mining drill from stopping due to a full chest.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Regularly supply iron ore to the furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) to keep them operational and avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning.\n\n### Out of Fuel in Mining Drill\n- Ensure the burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) is consistently supplied with fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-plate`: int, current count is 3285.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int, current count is 4.\n- `wooden-chest`: int, current count is 3.\n- `coal`: int, current count is 5.\n- `iron-ore`: int, current count is 2."}
