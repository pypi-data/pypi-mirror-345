{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone processing setup at position(x=-50.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-50.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-54.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-51.5, y=0.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-51.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### New stone processing setup at position(x=-50.0, y=2.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-50.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-47.0, y=2.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-49.5, y=2.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-48.5, y=2.5)\n- Assembling machine (position x=-41.5, y=2.5)\n- Additional burner inserter (position x=-45.5, y=2.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-39.5, y=2.5)\n\n### New production facility at position(x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=23.0, y=20.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=21.5, y=20.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=26.5, y=20.5)\n- Assembler inserter (position x=24.5, y=20.5)\n- Output chest (position x=28.5, y=20.5)\n- Small electric pole (position x=26.5, y=18.5)\n\n### Partial power plant at position(x=25.5, y=18.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler (position x=25.5, y=18.5) - incomplete due to placement issues\n- Small electric pole network (positions x=26.5,y=18.5 and x=28.5,y=18.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement validation errors (continued)\n- Verify terrain is completely clear before attempting to place entities (multiple failures on water tiles)\n- Check for existing entities in target placement area before attempting placement\n- Use proper spacing between entities (especially 2x2 and 3x3 buildings)\n- For power plants, verify water source availability before placing offshore pumps\n\n### Distance-related operation errors (continued)\n- Move within operational range (10 tiles) before attempting entity placement or interaction\n- Implement proper movement logic before distant operations\n- Verify player position relative to target before interactions (failed chest placement at x=-45.5, y=22.5 from 75 tiles away)\n\n### Power system construction issues\n- Ensure proper inventory checks before attempting to place solar panels\n- Verify electrical connectivity between power producers and consumers\n- Plan complete power plant layouts with clear paths for pole connections\n\n### Entity interaction errors\n- Use consistent argument passing style (avoid mixing positional and keyword arguments)\n- Implement proper error handling for entity lookup operations\n- Verify entity existence before attempting interactions\n\n### Production chain validation\n- Check output inserter placement matches actual assembler configuration\n- Verify all required components are available before starting production\n- Handle missing resource cases gracefully with fallback logic\n\n### Entity cleanup operations\n- Implement proper validation before attempting to clear blocking items\n- Verify entity drop positions are accessible before interaction\n- Handle cases where pickup operations fail due to invalid positions"}
