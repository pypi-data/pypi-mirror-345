{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position: -9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler (position: -6.0, 1.5)\n- Steam engine (position: -1.5, 4.5)\n- Connected with pipes between offshore pump and boiler (3 pipes) and boiler to steam engine (4 pipes)\n\n### Iron Production Line at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position: 15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest (position: 15.5, 72.5) for ore storage\n- Inserter (position: 16.5, 72.5) moving ore from chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace (position: 16.0, 74.0) smelting iron ore to plates\n- Assembling machine 2 (position: 21.5, 74.5) set to produce iron gear wheels\n- Output inserter (position: 18.5, 74.5)\n- Output chest (position: 19.5, 74.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement errors\n- Cannot place entities on occupied tiles: Check tile availability before placing entities\n- Cannot place entities too far away: Move closer to target position before placing (max distance is 10 tiles)\n\n### Connection errors\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces: Always use inserters between belts and furnaces/assemblers\n\n### Inventory management errors\n- Attempting to insert items not in inventory: Check inventory before insertion attempts\n- Full output chests stop production: Ensure output chests are emptied or add more storage\n\n### Production optimization\n- Mining drill stopped due to full chest: Add more furnaces or increase plate consumption\n- Furnace has no ingredients: Ensure ore supply chain is properly connected\n- Assembler missing resources: Verify input material supply chain is complete"}
