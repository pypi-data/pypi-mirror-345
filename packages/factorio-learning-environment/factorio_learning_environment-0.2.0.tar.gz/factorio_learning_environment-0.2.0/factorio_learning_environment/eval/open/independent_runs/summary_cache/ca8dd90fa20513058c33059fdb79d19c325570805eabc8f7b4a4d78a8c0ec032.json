Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or changing the reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities or invalid placement areas.\n\n### Errors due to misalignment of inserters\n- Verify the alignment of inserters with the mining drill's drop position to ensure they can effectively transfer items. Misalignment can lead to inefficiencies or blockages.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, make sure you have coal available before trying to refuel entities.\n\n### Errors due to fuel shortages\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation and avoid interruptions due to fuel shortages."}
