{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at (20.5, 75.5) fueled with coal, moving iron plates from furnace to first chest.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, with a burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) fueled and feeding it.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved power connectivity and inserters fueled, though output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network. However, pipe connection between boiler and steam engine has failed due to blocked or invalid connection points.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 placed at (25.5, 80.5), set to craft iron gear wheels but currently not producing due to missing iron plates.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5) connected to power network, powering the assembler.\n- Input burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding into the assembly area.\n- Output burner inserter newly placed at (25.5, 83.5), fueled with coal.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), replaced and positioned to receive assembling machine output.\n- Previous output chest at (25.5, 82.5) was removed to free space for inserter placement.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production, now powered and with output inserter placed, but still lacks input iron plates preventing operation.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous attempts to place burner inserter next to assembling machine output chest failed due to tile occupation; resolved by removing chest and repositioning inserter and chest.\n- To avoid such issues, always verify tile occupancy before placing entities, and rearrange or remove obstructing entities as needed.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5), (20.5, 75.5), and (25.5, 83.5) now have sufficient coal and are operational.\n- Previously, inserters failed due to lack of fuel or full inventory.\n- Maintain fuel supply to burner inserters and monitor their inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe input shortages\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) reports missing iron plates (2 units) preventing iron gear wheel production.\n- Input and output inventories of assembler remain empty despite inserters being operational.\n- Ensure sufficient iron plates are supplied to the assembler input chest to enable crafting.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Assembling machine now connected to power network via newly placed electric pole at (25.5, 77.5).\n- Pipe connection between boiler (-5.0, 2.5) and steam engine (0.5, 6.5) failed due to blocked or invalid fluid connection points.\n- To mitigate, ensure output belts and chests are clear and properly connected to accept items.\n- Verify fluid connection points between boilers and steam engines are unobstructed and correctly aligned.\n- Confirm electric poles"}
