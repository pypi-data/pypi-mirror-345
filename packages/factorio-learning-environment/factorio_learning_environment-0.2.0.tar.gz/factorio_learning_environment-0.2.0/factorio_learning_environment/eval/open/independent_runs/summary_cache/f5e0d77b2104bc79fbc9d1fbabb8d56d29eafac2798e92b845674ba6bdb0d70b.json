{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (40.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), and (43.5, -80.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), and (-14.5, -45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting resources\n- Ensure that the chest is not full before attempting to extract resources. Empty the chest if necessary to continue extraction.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source items are available for the inserters to function. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that the source entities are producing or holding the required items.\n\n### Errors when transferring iron ore to furnaces\n- Confirm that the iron ore is available in the inventory or chest before attempting to transfer it to the furnace. Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
