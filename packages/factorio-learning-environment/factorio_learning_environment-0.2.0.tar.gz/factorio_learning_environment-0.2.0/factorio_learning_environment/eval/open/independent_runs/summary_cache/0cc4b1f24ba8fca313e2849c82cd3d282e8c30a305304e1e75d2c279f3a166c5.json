{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) which is currently working with an inventory of coal.\n- Neighbouring wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) which is full and causing warnings.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(x=42.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0) which is currently working with an inventory of coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(x=42.5, y=-81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest at position (42.5, -81.5) with an inventory of coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) with an inventory of iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) which is currently working with an inventory of iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position(x=42.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) which is waiting for source items.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position(x=43.5, y=-81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter at position (43.5, -81.5) which is waiting for space in the destination.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when the wooden chest is full\n- The burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) is unable to continue mining because the wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Empty the chest to allow for continued operation.\n\n### Errors when using burner mining drill without fuel\n- The burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0) is reporting no fuel. Ensure to regularly check and insert coal into the burner mining drill to maintain its operation.\n\n### Errors when the stone furnace has no ingredients\n- The stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) has reported no ingredients to smelt. Ensure to provide iron ore to the furnace to keep it operational.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for items\n- Both burner inserters at positions (42.5, -80.5) and (43.5, -81.5) are waiting for source items or space in the destination. Check the connections and ensure there are items available for the inserters to work with.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked during the latest steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int (total amount of coal available)\n- `iron_ore`: int (total amount of iron ore available)\n- `iron_plate`: int (total amount of iron plates available)\n- `wood`: int (total amount of wood available)\n- `iron_gear_wheel`: int (total amount of iron gear wheels available)"}
