{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mine at position(37.0, -85.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (37.0, -85.0) and a Chest at position (36.5, -86.5) to store the mined coal. The coal is then transported to the inserter at position (36.5, -87.5) via the drop position.\n\n### Iron Plate Factory at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of a Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Line at position(36.5, -87.5)\nConsists of multiple belts, including a belt at position (37.5, -87.5) connected to the inserter at position (36.5, -87.5), and another belt at position (38.5, -86.5) extending the belt line. The belts are used to transport items.\n\n### Assembling Machine at position(43.5, -86.5)\nConsists of an Assembling Machine at position (43.5, -86.5) which is not yet connected to the power network.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n* **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Remove any existing entities at the target position.\n* **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients**\n  - Ensure you have all the required ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft an item.\n* **Errors when placing entities due to insufficient inventory**\n  - Ensure you have the entity you want to place in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n* **Errors when inserting items into entities due to insufficient inventory**\n  - Ensure you have the item you want to insert in your inventory before attempting to insert it.\n* **Errors when using incorrect API calls**\n  - Ensure you are using the correct API calls for the action you want to perform. For example, use `insert_item` to insert items into entities, not `place_entity`.\n* **Errors when connecting entities due to missing required items**\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities.\n* **Errors when crafting items due to missing required sub-ingredients**\n  - Ensure you have all the required sub-ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. If a sub-ingredient requires a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace, ensure you have the necessary equipment and resources."}
