{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with fuel (coal: 7), direction UP, and status WORKING. It has a warning: \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) with fuel (coal: 14), direction UP, and status NO_INGREDIENTS. It has a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt.\" The furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure the desired location is free of other entities before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing structures or items on the ground that may obstruct placement.\n\n### Errors when Retrieving Entities\n- Verify the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This ensures that the entity exists and is accessible at the given coordinates.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Ensure that the items you intend to insert are available in your inventory. Attempting to insert items not present in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or another processing unit) to accept the output from production entities like drills and furnaces. This prevents output blockage and ensures continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available and supplied to production entities like furnaces. This prevents production halts due to missing ingredients."}
