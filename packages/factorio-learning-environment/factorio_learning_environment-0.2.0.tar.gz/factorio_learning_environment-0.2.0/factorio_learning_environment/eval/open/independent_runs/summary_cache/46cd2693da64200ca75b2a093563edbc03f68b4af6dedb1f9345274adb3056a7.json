{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal (50 units). The furnace has warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\". It currently holds 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Group\nConsists of:\n- Pipes forming a group with a fluid system ID 9723, located at positions: \n  - (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=23.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of:\n- Electric poles at various positions, including:\n  - (x=0.5, y=20.5)\n  - (x=0.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=1.5, y=20.5)\n  - ... (additional positions not fully listed)\n  - (x=-8.5, y=16.5)\n  - (x=-7.5, y=15.5)\n  - (x=0.5, y=23.5)\n- The electricity group has a voltage of 0, indicating potential connectivity issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with Position Argument\n- When picking up entities or moving to a new area, ensure the position argument is correctly formatted as a Position object.\n\n### Offshore Pump Placement Issues\n- Ensure that the selected position for placing an offshore pump is suitable and has access to water.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Placement Errors\n- Verify that the positions chosen for placing boilers and steam engines are suitable and not obstructed.\n\n### Connection Failures\n- When connecting pipes or electric poles, ensure that the placement is correct and that the entities are within range to connect.\n\n### Move Function Errors\n- When using move functions, ensure that indices are integers and not strings to avoid errors."}
