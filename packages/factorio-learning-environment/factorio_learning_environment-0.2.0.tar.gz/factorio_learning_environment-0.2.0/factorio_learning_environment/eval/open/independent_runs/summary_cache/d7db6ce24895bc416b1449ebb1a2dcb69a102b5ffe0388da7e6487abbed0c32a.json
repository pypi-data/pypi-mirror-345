{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter Pickup and Drop Positions\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest and the drop position is aligned with the furnace to facilitate proper transfer of materials.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters with Insufficient Inventory\n- Verify that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel inserters or other entities to avoid failed refueling attempts.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target tile is not already occupied by another entity to prevent placement errors.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Double-check the inserter setup to ensure that it is correctly configured to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace. Adjust positions if necessary to ensure a smooth transfer of resources."}
