{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate and Copper Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) which is currently fueled with coal. The furnace is processing iron ore into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates. The furnace has 29 units of coal and is actively working, with iron ore being processed into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Storage Facility at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing items. The chest is currently empty.\n\n### Inserter Setup at Position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) intended to feed resources into the furnace at position (0.0, 0.0). Currently not operational due to lack of power connection.\n- Small Electric Pole at position (2.5, 1.5) intended to provide power to the inserter, but currently not supplying electricity.\n\n### Water Extraction Setup at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) to extract water. Currently not connected to any fluid system.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, before placing a stone furnace, make sure it exists in your inventory.\n- Ensure that you have an offshore pump in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. Attempting to place an offshore pump at (-9.0, 25.0) without having it in inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without having the required raw resources\n- Before attempting to craft an item, ensure you have all the necessary raw resources. For example, to craft a wooden chest, you need wood, which must be gathered as it is a raw resource and not craftable.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. For instance, avoid placing a small electric pole at (2.5, 0.5) if there is an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors when crafting items that require intermediate products\n- When crafting complex items, ensure you have all the necessary intermediate products. For instance, crafting an inserter requires electronic circuits, which in turn require copper cables and copper plates. Copper plates need to be smelted in a furnace. Ensure you have the necessary infrastructure and resources to produce these intermediate products before crafting the final item.\n- Ensure that you have the required crafting machines or smelting setups for items like copper plates, which cannot be crafted directly and require a furnace.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient smelting of copper plates\n- Ensure that copper ore is being processed in a furnace to produce copper plates before attempting to use them. If you encounter an assertion error regarding unsmelted copper plates, check that the furnace is operational and has the necessary copper ore and fuel.\n\n### Errors when inserting items not present in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into a furnace or any other entity, verify that you have the required items in your inventory. For example, ensure copper ore is available in your inventory before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n- Ensure you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with incorrect attributes\n- When connecting entities, ensure that all involved entities have the necessary attributes. For example, ensure that the entities have defined tile dimensions and are correctly positioned before attempting to connect them with transport belts or other connectors.\n\n### Errors when locating entities on the map\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to interact with are present on the map. For example, when trying to find the nearest small electric pole, make sure it has been placed on the map.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in unsuitable locations\n- Verify that the location where you intend to place an entity is suitable and unoccupied. For example, ensure there is no existing object at the target location before placing a small electric pole.\n\n### Errors when finding entities that do not exist\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to find or interact with exist on the map. For example, attempting to locate a steam engine that has not been placed will result in an error. Make sure the entity is placed and available on the map before attempting to interact with it.\n\n### Errors when crafting with insufficient resources\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting a boiler requires pipes and a stone furnace, which must be in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when attempting to use items not present in inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items"}
