{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Function: Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n  - Status: Working, but with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Function: Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n  - Status: Normal, contains 14 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n  - Status: Waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Function: Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Configuration\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning suggests potential misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Lack of coal can halt operations.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly empty the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent it from becoming full, which stops the mining drill from working.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure the furnace receives iron ore by checking the inserter setup and ensuring it is operational. The furnace frequently reports not receiving iron ore, indicating a potential issue with the supply chain."}
