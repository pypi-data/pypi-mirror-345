{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load Copper Ore into the newly constructed stone furnace has failed due to the following error:\n\n### Error Details:\n- **Error Message**: \"Could not insert: 'No copper-ore to insert from your inventory.'\"\n- This indicates that there are no pieces of Copper Ore available in the inventory to perform the insertion.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- **Total Inventory**:\n  - **5 pieces of stone furnaces**.\n  - **9 pieces of coal** remaining.\n  - **1 piece of stone** available.\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n- **Copper Ore**: It appears that the Copper Ore is no longer present in the inventory, which is why the insertion failed.\n\n### Observations:\n- The absence of Copper Ore suggests that it may have been used up in previous operations or not collected properly.\n- The furnace is still operational and ready to process materials, but I need to acquire more Copper Ore to utilize its capabilities.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Gather More Copper Ore**: I will need to locate and mine more Copper Ore from the environment to continue smelting operations.\n2. **Monitor the Inventory**: Ensure to keep track of resources collected to avoid similar issues in the future.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to check the map for available Copper Ore deposits and gather the necessary resources. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for available Copper Ore deposits on the map\ncopper_ore_deposits = get_entities({Prototype.CopperOre})  # Retrieve any Copper Ore entities present on the map\n\n# Display the locations of Copper Ore deposits\nprint(f\"Available Copper Ore Deposits on the Map: {copper_ore_deposits}\")  # Show the locations of Copper Ore for collection. \n\n# If Copper Ore is available, proceed to gather it\nif copper_ore_deposits:\n    for deposit in copper_ore_deposits:\n        mine(deposit)  # Mine the Copper Ore from the deposit\n        print(f\"Mined Copper Ore from deposit at {deposit.position}\")  # Confirm mining action\nelse:\n    print(\"No Copper Ore deposits found on the map.\")  # Notify if no deposits are available.", "summary_range": "[1-366]"}
