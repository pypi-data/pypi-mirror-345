Checks if we have a stone furnace in inventory\n2. Attempts to craft one if we don't have one but have enough stone\n3. Only proceeds with placement if we confirm we have a furnace\n4. Includes better error handling and inventory checking\n\nThis should resolve the \"No stone_furnace in inventory\" error we were seeing.", "summary_range": "[1-2250]"}
