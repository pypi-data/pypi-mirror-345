{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (16.5, 70.5) powered via electricity group 6954\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron plates (currently idle due to no input)\n- Connected to small electric poles at (16.5, 68.5) and other poles in group 6954\n\n#### New Iron Mining Setup at (20.5, 20.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (20.5, 20.5) (unpowered)\n- **Stone furnace** at (23.0, 20.0) (idle with \"NO_FUEL\" and \"NO_INGREDIENTS\")\n- Connected to small electric pole at (20.5, 18.5)\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Operation at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 73.0) smelting copper plates (currently idle with \"NO_INGREDIENTS\")\n- **Burner inserter** at (-45.5, 71.5) transferring items (fuel: 9 coal)\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (15.5, -0.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, -0.5) extracting coal (output blocked by full chest)\n- **Wooden chest** at (15.5, 1.5) full of coal (needs emptying)\n\n#### Power Generation Attempts\n- **Offshore pumps** at (-20.5, -3.5) and (-18.5, -3.5) (both not connected)\n- **Boiler** at (38.0, 40.5) (fueled but not connected to water)\n- Multiple disconnected pipes in pipe groups 1790 and 1793\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent Water Placement Issues\n- Failed placements at water-adjacent positions (30.0,30.0), (10.0,10.0), (40.0,40.0), (-16.0,-3.0)\n  - Solution: Maintain minimum 1 tile clearance from water edges for all placements\n  - Verify land positions with `can_place_entity()` before attempting placement\n\n#### Entity Placement Collisions\n- Repeated failures placing furnaces/inserters at occupied positions (20.0,22.0), (21.5,20.0)\n  - Solution: Check target positions with `get_entity()` before placement\n  - Implement collision detection in placement functions\n\n#### Entity Access Errors\n- Attempting to access non-existent copper drill at (-46.5,70.5)\n  - Solution: Verify entity existence with `get_entity()` before interaction\n  - Handle missing entities gracefully in automation scripts\n\n#### Power System Issues\n- Multiple disconnected power components (offshore pumps, boilers, pipes)\n  - Solution: Complete full power plant setup (pump\u2192boiler\u2192engine) in one session\n  - Ensure proper spacing (2 tiles horizontal between boiler and engine)\n  - Verify fluid connections with `get_fluid_connections()`\n\n#### Operational Gaps\n- Mining drills placed but not powered (20.5,20.5)\n  - Solution: Complete power infrastructure before placing dependent machines\n- Furnaces idle due to missing inputs/fuel\n  - Solution: Verify supply chains are complete before placing production buildings"}
