{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring items from the chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to:\n  - **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring items to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), connected to:\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron plates to:\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), storing iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Missing Entities\n- Ensure that all entities, such as chests, are correctly placed and defined in the game environment before attempting to interact with them. This will prevent errors like \"Could not find entity at x=-11.5 y=-44.5: name 'Chest' is not defined.\"\n\n### Inserter Waiting Errors\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear source and destination for items to avoid them waiting indefinitely. For example, the inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) is waiting for source items, and the inserter at (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) is waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Inventory Full Errors\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of furnaces and chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. For instance, the error \"Failed to insert iron-plate into stone-furnace... Inventory is full\" indicates that the furnace output needs to be cleared.\n\n### Variable Scope Errors\n- Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and accessible within the intended scope to avoid errors like \"UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'x' where it is not associated with a value.\"\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel burner entities to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations. This includes both burner mining drills and burner inserters."}
