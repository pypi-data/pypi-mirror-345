{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with coal fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with coal fuel, extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) for processing materials.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) transferring materials to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. Check your inventory for the necessary items to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Ensure that the output chests have enough space to store the extracted resources.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
