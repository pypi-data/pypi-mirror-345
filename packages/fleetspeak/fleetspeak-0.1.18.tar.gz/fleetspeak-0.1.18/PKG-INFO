Fleetspeak is a framework for communicating with a fleet of machines, with a focus on security monitoring and basic administrative use cases. It is a subproject of GRR ( https://github.com/google/grr/blob/master/README.md ), and can be seen as an effort to modularizing and modernizing its communication mechanism.
