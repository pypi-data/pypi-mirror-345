{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=40.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), and (x=43.5, y=-80.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-12.5, y=-49.5), and (x=-9.5, y=-49.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Ensure you are within the correct proximity to the chest or entity you are trying to extract from to avoid extraction failures.\n\n### Errors when transferring items to furnaces\n- Ensure that the variable 'x' is correctly initialized and associated with a value before attempting to transfer items to furnaces.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Verify the presence of the correct entity type at the specified position before attempting to refuel. Ensure that the entity exists and is of the correct type.\n\n### Errors when placing additional storage\n- Confirm that you have the required storage items (e.g., wooden chests) in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map.\n\n### Inserter alignment and fuel issues\n- Check the alignment and fuel status of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned and fueled to operate efficiently."}
