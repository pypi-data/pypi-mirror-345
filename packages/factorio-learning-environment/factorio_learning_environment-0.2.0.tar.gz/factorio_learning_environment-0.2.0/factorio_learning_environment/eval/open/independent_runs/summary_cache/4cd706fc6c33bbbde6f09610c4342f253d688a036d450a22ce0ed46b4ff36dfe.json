The pickup position should be set to the exact coordinates of the chest to avoid misalignment errors.\n\n### Errors Due to Inserter Fuel Shortage\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel. This will ensure continuous operation and prevent stoppages in the production line.\n\n### Errors in Resource Transfer to Furnace\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly positioned to drop items into the furnace. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of iron ore from the chest to the furnace, halting production.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors."}
