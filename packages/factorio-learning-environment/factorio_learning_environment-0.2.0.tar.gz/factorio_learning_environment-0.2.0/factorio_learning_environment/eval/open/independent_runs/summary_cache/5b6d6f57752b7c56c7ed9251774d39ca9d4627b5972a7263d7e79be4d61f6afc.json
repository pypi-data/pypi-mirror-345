{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions including (-24.5, -69.5) and (-21.5, -67.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-23.5, -69.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- Transport Belts connecting positions (-12.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -56.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-12.5, -54.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-20.5, -63.5) for iron plate storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (1.5, 0.5) for iron plate storage\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (53.0, -83.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Undefined Entity Errors\n- Ensure that all entities used in the code are correctly defined and imported. For example, the error \"NameError: name 'Chest' is not defined\" suggests that the 'Chest' entity was not properly defined or imported.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to avoid halting production processes. For example, the error \"chest at drop position is full\" indicates that the chest needs to be emptied to continue mining operations."}
