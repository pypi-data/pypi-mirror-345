{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0) with status NO_FUEL\n- Steam engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler with water, status FULL_OUTPUT\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine with steam, status EMPTY\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status FULL_OUTPUT\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with Boiler Dimensions\n- Ensure that the correct attributes are accessed for boiler dimensions. The attribute `tile_dimensions` does not exist; verify the correct attribute names in the API documentation.\n\n### Type Errors with Boiler Box Calculations\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that all operands are of compatible types. Convert `ModelPrivateAttr` to a real number or string before performing arithmetic operations.\n\n### Connection Errors Due to Missing Items\n- Ensure that all required items, such as pipes or small electric poles, are available in the inventory before attempting to connect entities. Craft or gather the necessary items beforehand.\n\n### Failed Connections Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Before attempting to connect entities, verify that the inventory contains the necessary materials. For example, ensure sufficient copper plates and wood are available to craft copper cables and small electric poles.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnace\n- Ensure that the correct entity type and position are specified when extracting items from a furnace. Verify the presence of the expected items in the furnace before extraction attempts.\n\n### Lab Connection and Status Errors\n- Ensure that the lab is correctly connected to the power network and that all required inputs are available. Verify the lab's position and existence on the map."}
