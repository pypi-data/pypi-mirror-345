{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining and smelting iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) used for storing mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a storage chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing the produced iron plates.\n\n### Additional Storage Chests\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) are used for storing iron plates.\n\n### Idle Stone Furnace at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) is currently idle with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity has the items you intend to extract. Verify the inventory of the entity before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Confirm that the source entity has sufficient items to insert. Check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Regularly check and clear the drop position of inserters to prevent blockages. Ensure there is enough space in the destination for the inserter to place items.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Monitor the fuel levels of burner entities to ensure continuous operation. Refuel them timely to avoid interruptions in production processes."}
