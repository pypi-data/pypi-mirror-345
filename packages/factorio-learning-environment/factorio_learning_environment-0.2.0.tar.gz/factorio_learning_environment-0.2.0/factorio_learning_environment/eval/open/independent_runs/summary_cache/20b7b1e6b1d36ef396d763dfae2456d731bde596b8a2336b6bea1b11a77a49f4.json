Check the inventory status of the storage entity to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Drop Chests\n- Verify that the drop chest is not full before attempting to clear it. Regularly monitor and empty the chest to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
