{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0)  \n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5)  \n\n#### Inserter Setup at position (-16.5, -44.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner inserter (position -16.5, -44.5)  \n- Burner inserter (position -15.5, -44.5)  \n- Burner inserter (position -13.5, -44.5)  \n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear and buildable before attempting to place entities like wooden chests, transport belts, or burner inserters.  \n- Move to a different location if the current tile is occupied or invalid.  \n\n#### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has a valid source entity (e.g., a chest or furnace) with items to pick up.  \n- Verify the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities.  \n\n#### Repeated placement attempts in the same invalid location\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to place entities in the same non-buildable location. Move to a new area and check for buildable tiles.  \n\n#### General placement errors\n- Always verify the position and orientation of entities before placement to avoid conflicts with existing structures or terrain."}
