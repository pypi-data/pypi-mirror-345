{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone brick factory at position(0,0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with 1 stone-brick in the output inventory and 17 coal in the fuel inventory. The furnace has been used to smelt stone into stone-bricks.\n\n### Stone wall factory at position(5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine at position (5.5, 0.5) with a recipe set to 'stone-wall'. It has 4 stone-bricks in the input inventory but is not receiving electricity.\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-7.0, -0.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5), a boiler at position (-7.0, -0.5), a steam engine at position (-3.5, 1.5), and a pipe group connecting them. The boiler is currently working, and the offshore pump is also working. However, the steam engine is not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place a steam engine at an occupied position\n- Ensure that the target location is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure that the connection points of the entities are not blocked and are compatible. The pipe connection between the boiler and the steam engine failed because the connection points were not valid.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an empty furnace\n- Check if the furnace contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n- Ensure that the furnace has finished crafting the item before attempting to extract it.\n\n### Errors when using undefined or non-existent entities\n- Ensure that entities exist at the specified position before attempting to access or manipulate them.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target location is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Errors when placing or using entities without power\n- Ensure that entities that require power are connected to a power network.\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to each other with insufficient spacing\n- Ensure that there is sufficient spacing between entities to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into an assembling machine without required ingredients\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has the required ingredients before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors when boiler is out of fuel\n- Ensure that the boiler has a sufficient fuel supply to operate.\n\n### Errors when assembling machine is not receiving electricity\n- Ensure that the assembling machine is connected to a power network.\n\n### Errors when steam engine is not connected to power network\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to a power network.\n\n### Repeated errors when extracting stone-brick from stone-furnace\n- The furnace is empty and has no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that you have stone in your inventory to insert into the furnace.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: Entity, type: stone-furnace\n- `assembling_machine`: Entity, type: assembling-machine-2\n- `boiler`: Entity, type: boiler\n- `offshore_pump`: Entity, type: offshore-pump\n- `steam_engine`: Entity, type: steam-engine\n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs."}
