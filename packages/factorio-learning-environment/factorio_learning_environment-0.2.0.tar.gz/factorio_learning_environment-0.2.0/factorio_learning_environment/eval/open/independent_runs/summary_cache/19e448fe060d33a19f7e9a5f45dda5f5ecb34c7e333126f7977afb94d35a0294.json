{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled and processing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt.\n- BeltGroup connecting entities from (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) fueled and processing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5) transferring copper plates to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) storing copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) transferring copper plates to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5), (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), and (x=11.5, y=0.5) have access to source items. Check connected chests or furnaces to ensure they are adequately stocked.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Verify that the destination chests or belts for inserters, particularly at position (x=8.5, y=0.5), have sufficient space to receive items. Clear any blockages or redistribute items to free up space.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items\n- When attempting to extract items, ensure that there is a valid entity containing the items at the specified position. For example, extraction attempts at position (x=4.5, y=0.5) failed due to the absence of iron plates. Check the inventory of entities before extraction attempts."}
