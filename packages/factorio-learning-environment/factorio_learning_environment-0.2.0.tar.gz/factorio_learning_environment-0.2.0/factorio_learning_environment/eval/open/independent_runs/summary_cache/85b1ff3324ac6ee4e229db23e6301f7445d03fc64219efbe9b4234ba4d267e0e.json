{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nThis facility is designed for the extraction and smelting of iron ore into iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0): Extracts iron ore from the ground. It is currently fueled with coal and is operational but has a warning indicating that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, suggesting the need for a sink entity to accept the output.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt, as indicated by its warning status.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest, Transport Belt, Stone Furnace, and Burner Inserter at the desired location**: Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity being placed. Check for any obstructions or existing entities that might block placement.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- **Could not extract iron-ore from burner-mining-drill**: Make sure to move closer to the target entity where you want to extract from before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors in Code Execution\n- **NameError: name 'ore_furnace' is not defined**: Ensure that all variables are correctly defined and initialized before use. Double-check for typographical errors in variable names.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- **Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory**: Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status and warnings of entities to ensure they are functioning as intended and address any issues such as blocked outputs or missing ingredients.\n- Keep track of inventory levels to ensure that necessary resources are available for continuous production and operation of facilities."}
