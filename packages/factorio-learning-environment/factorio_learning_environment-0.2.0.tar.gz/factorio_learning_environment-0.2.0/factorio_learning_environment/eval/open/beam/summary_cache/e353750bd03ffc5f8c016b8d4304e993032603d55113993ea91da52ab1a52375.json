{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load Copper Ore into the active furnace has not resulted in the expected outcome:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace is still empty after the attempt to load **1 piece of Copper Ore**.\n- The furnace remains in a **\"WORKING\"** state but shows no items in the furnace source or any products being processed.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **1 piece of stone** available\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** is still available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not recognizing the Copper Ore input, which is necessary for it to engage in the smelting process.\n- The furnace is still in a **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"** state despite being labeled as **\"WORKING.\"**\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Furnace Configuration**: Ensure that the furnace is configured properly to accept Copper Ore as input.\n2. **Reinsert Stone**: If the furnace is not recognizing the Copper Ore, I may need to reinsert the stone to see if it resets the input recognition.\n3. **Monitor for Changes**: After reinserting stone, observe any changes in the furnace status to ensure it begins the smelting operation.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by reinserting the **1 piece of stone** into the active furnace to see if it resets the input recognition. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the stone back into the active furnace to check if it resets the input recognition\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Insert 1 piece of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_stone_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading stone: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading stone: {overall_inventory_after_stone_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-336]"}
