{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Science Pack Production Line (around position 8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Input chest at (5.5, 13.5)\n- Burner inserter at (6.5, 13.5) that moves items from input chest to assembling machine\n- Assembling machine-1 at (8.5, 13.5) producing automation science packs\n- Burner inserter at (10.5, 13.5) that moves items from assembling machine to output chest\n- Output chest at (11.5, 13.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (around position -4.5, 16.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5) providing water\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 16.0) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5) generating electricity\n- Connected pipe networks for water and steam transport\n- Electrical network connecting various machines\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining/smelting setups:\n1. First setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n- Output inserter at (-23.5, -58.5)\n- Storage chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n2. Second setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0)\n- Chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n- Output inserter at (-13.5, -50.5)\n- Storage chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\n### Coal Mining Setup (around position 41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Storage chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to extract non-existent items\n- Verify that items exist in the target chest before attempting to extract them\n- The automation science pack extraction attempts are failing because the output chest is empty\n- Ensure production line is working properly before attempting to collect products\n\n### Production line stalling issues\n- Monitor assembling machine status for ingredient shortages\n- Ensure consistent supply of both iron gear wheels and copper plates\n- Keep boiler fueled to maintain power generation for assembling machines\n\n### Resource management\n- Keep boiler properly fueled to maintain consistent power generation\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner inserters and mining drills\n- Ensure proper connection of pipe systems for water and steam flow"}
