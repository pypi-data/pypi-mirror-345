{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Warning: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Contains iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest, burner mining drill, stone furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the desired location.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with collision\n- Before placing an entity, ensure there is no collision with existing entities or terrain (e.g., water). Consider adjusting spacing, changing direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors with inserter setup\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure they are fueled and have a clear path to move items.\n\n### Errors due to full chest\n- Regularly check and clear the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of fuel (coal) for all entities that require it, such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces, to ensure continuous operation."}
