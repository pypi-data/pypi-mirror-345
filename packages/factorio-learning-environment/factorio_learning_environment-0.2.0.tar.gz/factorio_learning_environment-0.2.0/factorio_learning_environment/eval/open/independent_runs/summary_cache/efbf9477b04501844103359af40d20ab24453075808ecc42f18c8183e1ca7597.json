{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is responsible for generating electricity, the boiler converts water into steam, and the offshore pump provides water to the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) for processing copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Lab at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a lab (position 5.0, 5.0) for conducting research.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups that connect various entities, facilitating the flow of fluids between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting electricity poles\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect electricity poles. In this case, small electric poles could not be connected due to insufficient inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Gather necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is required for crafting small electric poles, and it must be gathered first.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
