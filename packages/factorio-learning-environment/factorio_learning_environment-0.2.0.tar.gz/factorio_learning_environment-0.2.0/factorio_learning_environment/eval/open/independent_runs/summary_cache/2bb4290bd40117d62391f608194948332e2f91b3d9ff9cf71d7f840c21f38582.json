{"content": "Based on the provided logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around position x=45, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Iron ore input chest at (45.5, -79.5) containing 13 iron ore\n- Iron plate output chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n- Two burner inserters at (44.5, -79.5) and (46.5, -79.5)\n\n### Coal Mining System (around position x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5), both full with 1600 coal each\n- Output wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) containing 476 coal\n\n### Additional Storage\n- Empty wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target position is already occupied\n- When using place_entity_next_to(), ensure proper spacing and verify no entities exist at the target location\n- Consider using different spacing values or directions when initial placement fails\n\n### Inserter Placement and Orientation\n- Ensure correct positioning of inserters relative to source and target entities\n- Verify pickup and drop-off positions are valid before placing inserters\n- When rotating inserters, confirm the new orientation allows proper item transfer\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities at specific coordinates\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places entities adjacent to existing ones with specified spacing and direction\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: EntityReference (Burner Inserter)\n- second_inserter: EntityReference (Burner Inserter)\n\nSuccess/Failure Patterns:\n- Success: Inserter placement and rotation when positions are clear\n- Failure: Entity placement when target location is occupied\n- Failure: Adjacent placement when insufficient space or existing entities block placement"}
