{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Central power pole (position x=0.5, y=10.5)\n\nThis structure generates electricity for the factory by pumping water from a nearby water source, heating it in the boiler using coal to produce steam, which then powers the steam engine. The agent has been regularly adding coal to the boiler to maintain power generation, with a throughput of approximately 738 water/steam per minute when operating properly. Currently, the boiler is out of fuel and the system is not generating power.\n\n### Stone Mining Operation at position (-50.0, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 (position x=-48.5, y=7.5) with wooden chest (position x=-48.5, y=9.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 (position x=-51.5, y=12.5) with wooden chest (position x=-51.5, y=14.5)\n- Electric mining drill 3 (position x=-48.5, y=16.5) with wooden chest (position x=-48.5, y=18.5)\n- Electric mining drill 4 (position x=-52.5, y=18.5) with wooden chest (position x=-52.5, y=20.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting the drills to the power network\n\nThis structure mines stone from several stone patches and deposits it into adjacent wooden chests for storage. The mining operation produces stone at varying rates between 95-172 stone per minute when operational. Current stone amounts in chests:\n- Chest at x=-48.5, y=9.5: 567 stone\n- Chest at x=-51.5, y=14.5: 603 stone\n- Chest at x=-48.5, y=18.5: 543 stone\n- Chest at x=-52.5, y=20.5: 602 stone\n\nCurrently, the mining drills are not operating due to lack of power.\n\n### Stone Brick Production Line at position (-20.0, 35.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 (position x=-30.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-29.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 2 (position x=-25.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-24.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 3 (position x=-20.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-19.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 4 (position x=-15.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-14.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 5 (position x=-10.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-9.5, y=36.5)\n- Input belt segments at x=-34.5, y=33.5 and other positions\n- Output belt segments at x=-34.5, y=37.5 and other positions\n- Small electric poles powering the inserters at positions x=-23.5, y=36.5; x=-18.5, y=36.5; and x=-13.5, y=36.5\n\nThis structure smelts stone into stone bricks. The furnaces are fueled with coal and have some stone bricks ready for extraction. Currently, the inserters are not operating due to lack of power, but the furnaces still have fuel and some are processing the last bits of stone.\n\n### Stone Wall Production at position (-17.5, 47.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position x=-17.5, y=47.5) set to produce stone walls\n- Output wooden chest (position x=-15.5, y=47.5) for collecting stone walls\n- Small electric pole providing power to the assembling machine\n\nThis structure produces stone walls from stone bricks. The assembling machine takes stone bricks as input and produces stone"}
