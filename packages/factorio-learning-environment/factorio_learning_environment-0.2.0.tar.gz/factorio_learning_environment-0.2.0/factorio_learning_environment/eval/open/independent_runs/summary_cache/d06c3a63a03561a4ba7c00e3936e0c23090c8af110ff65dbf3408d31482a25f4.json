{"content": "Here is the report based on the execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around position x=41-46, y=-80)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal, facing south\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing east\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) moving items from belt to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (46.0, -80.0) facing north\n\nThe system appears to be a coal mining and processing setup, with automated transport between components. Currently the system is partially working but has some blockages in the transport chain.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Alignment Issues\n- When placing furnaces, ensure proper collision box handling and spacing from other entities\n- Pay attention to entity height alignment, especially for multi-tile entities like furnaces\n- Double check entity facing directions match the intended flow of materials\n\n### Transport System Blockages  \n- Clear blocked transport belts before attempting to continue mining operations\n- Ensure there is a proper output sink entity to accept processed materials\n- Monitor belt capacity and flow to prevent backup issues\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Verify furnace has both fuel and ingredients before expecting operation\n- Check furnace input/output connections are properly configured\n- Monitor furnace warnings to identify missing requirements\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Mining drill fuel: Dict[str, int] - Tracks fuel levels in mining drill\n- Chest inventory: Dict[str, int] - Tracks items in wooden chest\n- Current inventory: Dict[str, int] - Tracks agent's personal inventory\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING - Entity is operating normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION - Entity waiting for output space\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS - Entity missing required inputs\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL - Entity in default working state"}
