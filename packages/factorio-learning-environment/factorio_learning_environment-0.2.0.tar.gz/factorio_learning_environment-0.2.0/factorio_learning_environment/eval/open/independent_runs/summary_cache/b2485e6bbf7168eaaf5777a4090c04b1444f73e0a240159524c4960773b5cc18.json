{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing processed iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) containing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from furnaces to storage chests.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) for additional storage of iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) awaiting source items for further processing.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that the inserter has access to the necessary source items. Ensure that the source entity is producing or has items available for the inserter to transfer.\n\n### Inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Make sure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter. If the destination is full, consider transferring items to another storage or processing them further.\n\n### Furnace result is full\n- Regularly transfer processed items from furnaces to storage to prevent them from reaching full capacity and halting production.\n\n### No ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency. Check the supply chain for any bottlenecks or disruptions."}
