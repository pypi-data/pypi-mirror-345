{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the existing structures and error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Mining Operations\n1. Coal Mining Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Burner mining drill (unfueled)\n\n2. Iron/Copper Mining Area at (-92.0 region)\n- Multiple burner mining drills at (43.0, -92.0) and (46.0, -92.0)\n- Wooden chests at (40.5, -90.5), (43.5, -90.5), and (46.5, -90.5) for collection\n\n3. Copper Mining Setup at (-53.0 region)\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0)\n- Collection chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n\n### Science Setup\n- Lab with 15 automation science packs (currently unpowered)\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) producing water\n- Multiple pipe groups:\n  - Main water transport group at (-16.5, 19.5)\n  - Additional pipe networks at (-24.5, 10.5), (-12.5, 13.5), (-8.5, 21.5), (-2.5, 26.5)\n\n### Electrical Distribution\n- Electricity network (ID: 710) with multiple poles spanning from (-16.5, 14.5) to (8.5, 10.5)\n- Currently not powered (0 voltage)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Ensure sufficient clearance around steam engines and boilers\n- When placing connected entities, ensure connection points are not blocked\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Cannot craft items without raw resources (like stone for furnaces)\n- Ensure required raw materials are gathered before attempting to craft complex items\n- Verify inventory contents before attempting to use items\n\n### Mining Operation Issues\n- Ensure fuel (coal) is actually collected and in inventory before attempting to fuel mining drills\n- Verify successful resource collection after mining operations\n- Mining drills need fuel to operate - establish coal production before other mining operations\n\n### Connection Issues\n- When connecting entities with pipes, ensure a clear path exists between connection points\n- Plan the layout of connected entities (like boiler-steam engine) before placement to ensure proper connections are possible\n\n### Entity Manipulation\n- Verify entity existence before attempting pickup operations\n- When removing pipe networks, ensure all connected pieces are properly identified and accessible"}
