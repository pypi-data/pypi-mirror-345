{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (10, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0)\n- Boiler at position (10.0, 1.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (1, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (1.0, 1.0) and a furnace at position (10.0, 1.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (1.0, 3.0) and a furnace at position (10.0, 3.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (1.0, 5.0) and a furnace at position (10.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (8.5, 1.5) and inserter at position (7.5, 1.5) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position (10.0, 1.0) to the assembling machine at position (8.5, 1.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that cannot accommodate the pole (e.g., water). Check the coordinates before placing.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position. If the entity is not found, check the position for accuracy and ensure that the entity has not been removed or relocated. \n\n### Repeated errors\n- The agent repeatedly encountered issues with placing electric poles at coordinates (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0). Ensure to check for obstacles in these areas before attempting to place poles again."}
