The following components were referenced during operations, but none resulted in a confirmed placement on the map:\n \n### Lab Supply Attempt at Position(0.5, 2.5)\n\u2022 Intended as the target for supplying Automation Science Packs, this Lab was repeatedly looked for, attempted to be placed, and crafted. All attempts failed due to missing inventory and insufficient resources, so no Lab structure is present.\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0)\n\u2022 An existing furnace was retrieved and used to smelt iron ore into additional iron plates. This structure enabled the smelting process needed to boost iron-plate inventory.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)\n\u2022 An existing copper furnace was retrieved to process copper ore into copper plates, supporting the supply chain needed for subsequent production steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 get_entities API Misuse\n  \u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments. Always verify the function\u2019s signature before invocation.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Retrieval Failures\n  \u2013 Before attempting placement, confirm that the required Lab is available in the inventory.\n  \u2013 When retrieving entities, check for a None result before iterating, to prevent type errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Ingredient Shortages\n  \u2013 Ensure that all sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available in sufficient quantities.\n  \u2013 Review the entire crafting chain and prerequisites (e.g. smelting steps for iron plates and copper plates) to avoid missing ingredient errors.\n  \u2013 Confirm the exact ingredient counts required by the recipe before initiating a Lab craft attempt.\n\nNo utility functions were defined by the agent in these steps."}
