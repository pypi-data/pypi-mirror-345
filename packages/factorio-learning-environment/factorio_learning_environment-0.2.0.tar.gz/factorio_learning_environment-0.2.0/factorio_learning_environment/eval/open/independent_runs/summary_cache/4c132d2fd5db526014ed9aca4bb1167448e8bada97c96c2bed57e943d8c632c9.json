{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided execution logs:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Mining and Smelting Complex at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Transport belt at (-29.5, -59.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5) containing iron and copper ore\n- Input burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n- Output burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), and (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Multiple transport belts connecting the system\n- Storage chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for material movement at (-6.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -56.5), (-4.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -56.5)\n\n### Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Input inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5) containing iron plates\n- Output inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - ensure regular fuel supply to all burner devices\n- Keep coal in inventory before attempting to insert fuel into machines\n\n### Inserter Placement Issues\n- Ensure proper alignment between inserters and their target entities\n- Check that inserters have both pickup and drop-off targets before placement\n\n### Entity Output Blocking\n- Some inserters are blocked due to missing output destinations\n- Ensure complete production chains with proper output handling before starting operations\n\n### Resource Flow Issues\n- Multiple inserters waiting for source items indicates breaks in the production chain\n- Verify that all parts of production lines are properly connected and supplied with materials"}
