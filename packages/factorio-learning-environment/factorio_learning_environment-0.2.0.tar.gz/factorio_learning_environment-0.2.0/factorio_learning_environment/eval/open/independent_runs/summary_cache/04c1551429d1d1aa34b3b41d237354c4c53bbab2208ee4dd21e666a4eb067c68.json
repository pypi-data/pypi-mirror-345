Check inventory levels before attempting to deposit items.\n\n### Errors when supplying materials to furnaces\n- Make sure there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply it to furnaces. Regularly monitor and replenish your iron ore stock to avoid supply interruptions.\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not blocked. Clear any obstructions from the inserter's drop position to maintain smooth operation.\n\n### Errors when mining\n- Regularly check and empty chests at mining drill drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full chests."}
