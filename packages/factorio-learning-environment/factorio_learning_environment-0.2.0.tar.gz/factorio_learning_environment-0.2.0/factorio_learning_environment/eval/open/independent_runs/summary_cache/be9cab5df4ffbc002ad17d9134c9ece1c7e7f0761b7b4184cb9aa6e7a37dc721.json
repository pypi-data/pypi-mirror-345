{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (23.5, -16.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, 21.5) for iron ore storage\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (-10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (-9.0, 20.0)\n\n### Copper Processing Complex at (22, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (20.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (20.5, 21.5) for copper ore storage\n- Stone furnace at position (24.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (24.5, 17.5) for copper plate storage\n- Burner inserter at position (24.5, 18.5) moving items between furnace and storage\n- Burner inserter at position (22.5, 20.5) oriented right\n- Burner inserter at position (20.5, 22.5) moving items to/from chest\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connections\n- Cannot connect belts directly from chests - use inserters as intermediaries\n- When connecting entities with belts, ensure the path between start and end positions is clear and valid\n- Belt connections need proper alignment between source and destination points\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - ensure fuel supply is maintained\n- Furnaces have no ingredients to smelt - set up proper input logistics\n- Some furnaces show \"furnace fuel source is full\" warning - this is expected when fuel capacity is reached"}
