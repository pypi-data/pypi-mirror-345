{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled with coal, currently operational with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing 571 iron ore, acting as the drop-off point for the mining drill.\n- Additional Wooden Chests at various positions (5.5, -60.5; 7.5, -60.5; 6.5, -60.5; 9.5, -60.5; 8.5, -60.5) storing iron plates, indicating a network of storage for processed materials.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Network\nConsists of multiple Wooden Chests and Iron Chests at various positions storing iron plates:\n- Positions include (-21.5, -54.5; -20.5, -54.5; -18.5, -54.5; -19.5, -54.5; -4.5, -52.5; -5.5, -52.5; -3.5, -52.5; -2.5, -52.5; -14.5, -50.5; -13.5, -50.5; -12.5, -50.5; -11.5, -50.5; -10.5, -50.5; -9.5, -50.5; -8.5, -50.5; -7.5, -50.5; -6.5, -50.5; -5.5, -50.5).\n- Some chests are full, indicating a need for better inventory management or expansion of storage capacity.\n\n### Stone Furnace Operations\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently inactive due to no ingredients to smelt, with a result inventory containing 22 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) with similar status and inventory.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -49.5) full of iron plates, indicating a bottleneck in the smelting process.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to extract items from chests. Regularly check and manage inventory to prevent overflow and inefficiencies.\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Regularly monitor the status of chests to prevent them from becoming full. Consider expanding storage capacity or improving logistics to move items efficiently.\n\n### Smelting Process Inefficiencies\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain to ensure a continuous flow of raw materials to the furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the agent's current inventory, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
