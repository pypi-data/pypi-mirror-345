{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) which supplies iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) which supplies copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) which processes copper ore into copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Currently, both the stone furnace at (41.0, -80.0) and the stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) are showing warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\". Regularly check and supply the required ores to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drills\n- The burner mining drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) has a warning indicating \"output blocked by item on the ground\". Ensure that there is a clear path or a sink entity in place to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockages and maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like stone furnaces, stone, iron plates, and copper plates.\n- `position`: Tuple[float, float] - Represents the position coordinates of entities on the map."}
