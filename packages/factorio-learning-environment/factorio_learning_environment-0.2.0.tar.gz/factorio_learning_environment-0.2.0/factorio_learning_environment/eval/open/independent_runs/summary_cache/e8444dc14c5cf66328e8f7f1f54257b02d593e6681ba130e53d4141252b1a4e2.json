{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (40.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (43.5, -80.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), (-9.5, -49.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), (-14.5, -45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from chests\n- Ensure that the target chest contains the items you intend to extract. Verify the chest's inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when transferring iron ore to furnaces\n- Make sure the furnaces have available space to accept new items. Check the furnace's inventory and status before transferring items.\n\n### Errors when moving items from mining drill drop positions\n- Confirm that the drop position is linked to a valid chest entity containing the intended items. Ensure the chest is not full and is correctly positioned to receive items from the mining drill.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status and inventory of all entities to ensure they are functioning correctly and not blocked by full inventories or missing resources."}
