{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 22.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-13.5, 22.0) (not connected)\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5) (not connected)\n- Pipe connections (not fully established)\n- Steam engine at position (-14.5, 20.5) (not connected)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place entities. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to existing objects\n- Check for existing objects in the target location before placing entities. If an object is in the way, choose a different position.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that the connection points between entities (like pipes) are clear and that the entities are properly positioned to establish connections. Ensure that there are no obstructions preventing the connection.\n\n### Errors when checking inventory of non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to check (like a wooden chest) exists at the specified position before attempting to access its inventory.\n\n### Errors when attempting to remove obstructions\n- Confirm that the obstruction can be removed and that the entity you are trying to manipulate has the correct attributes to allow removal.\n\n### Errors when adding items to entities\n- Ensure that the target entity can accept the items you are trying to add and that you are within range to perform the action. Verify that there is a nearby entity that can accept the items.\n\n### Errors related to non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to interact with (like boiler or wooden chest) exist at the specified positions before performing actions on them.\n\n### Errors when repositioning entities\n- When attempting to reposition an entity, ensure that the new position is clear of obstructions. If there are existing objects in the way, find an alternative position.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are not obstructed and that the entities are positioned correctly to allow for fluid transfer. Check that the connection points are valid and accessible.\n\n### Errors when trying to pick up non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are attempting to pick up exists at the specified position before trying to perform the action."}
