{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner Inserter at (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (16 units)\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner Mining Drill at (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), Stone Furnace at (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) is correctly aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent it from becoming full and halting mining operations. The chest should be monitored to ensure it does not overflow with iron ore.\n\n### Errors with Resource Supply to Furnace\n- Verify that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt by ensuring a continuous supply of iron ore from the chest via the inserter."}
