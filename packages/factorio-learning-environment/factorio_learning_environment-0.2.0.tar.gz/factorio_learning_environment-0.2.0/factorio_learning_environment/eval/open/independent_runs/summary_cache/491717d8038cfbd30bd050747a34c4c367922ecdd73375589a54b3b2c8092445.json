{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo compound structures have been successfully created by the agent thus far. Although several steps attempted to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for research purposes, none were successfully crafted or placed. The agent did reference existing furnace entities during smelting operations (one furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and one copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)), but these were pre\u2010existing and not built as part of a compound structure.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Issues with get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments or positional parameters when invoking get_entities. Verify the function\u2019s signature and use only allowed arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Retrieval Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Before iterating over or filtering retrieved lab entities, confirm that the returned value is not None.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the required lab item is available in the inventory prior to attempting placement, to prevent placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Shortfalls:\n\u2003\u2013 Satisfy all sub-ingredient requirements (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) before initiating lab crafting.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the available resources or downstream production steps (e.g., smelting and intermediate crafting) can supply the necessary components for lab assembly."}
