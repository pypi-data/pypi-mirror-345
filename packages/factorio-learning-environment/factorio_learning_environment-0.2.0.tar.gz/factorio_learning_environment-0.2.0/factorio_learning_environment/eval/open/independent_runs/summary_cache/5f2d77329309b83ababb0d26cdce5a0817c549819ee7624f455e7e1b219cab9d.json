{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport Belt starting at position (-24.5, -69.5) and ending at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) for storing extracted copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing produced iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt Group connecting various positions for transporting iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the positions you are trying to connect with transport belts are valid and within reach. The error \"attempt to index field ? (a nil value)\" suggests that there might be an issue with the specified positions or the entities at those positions.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Make sure that inserters have access to source items. If an inserter is waiting for source items, check the connected entities to ensure they are supplying the necessary resources.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt. The warning \"no ingredients to smelt\" indicates that the furnace is missing input materials. Check the supply chain leading to the furnace to ensure it is receiving the necessary resources."}
