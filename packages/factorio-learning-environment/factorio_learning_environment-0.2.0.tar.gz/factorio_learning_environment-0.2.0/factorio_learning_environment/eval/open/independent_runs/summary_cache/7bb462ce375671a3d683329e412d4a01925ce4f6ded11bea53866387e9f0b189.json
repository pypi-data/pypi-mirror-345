{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (63.5, -52.5) to transfer materials to/from the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- Two Burner Inserters at positions (-16.5, -51.5) and (-14.5, -51.5) to manage the flow of iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the intended placement location before attempting to place an entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot place burner-inserter at the target location - something is in the way.\"\n\n### Insufficient Iron Ore Collection\n- Regularly check and adjust connections to ensure a steady supply of iron ore to the furnace. This will prevent the furnace from running out of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Output Blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity available to accept outputs from inserters to avoid output blockage errors."}
