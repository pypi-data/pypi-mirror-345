{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore. Currently fueled with coal and operational, but its output chest is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Used for storing extracted iron ore. Contains 11 units of iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Additional storage capacity for extracted materials. Currently empty.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates. Fueled with coal and actively working, with 44 iron plates produced.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers items between chests. Fueled with coal and waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is unoccupied. If an entity already exists at the desired position, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and clear storage chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Ensure that there is a mechanism to transfer items from full chests to available storage or processing units."}
