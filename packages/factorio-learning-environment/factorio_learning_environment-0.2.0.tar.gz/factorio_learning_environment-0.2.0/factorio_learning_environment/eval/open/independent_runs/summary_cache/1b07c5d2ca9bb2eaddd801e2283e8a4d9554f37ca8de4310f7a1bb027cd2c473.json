{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59) smelting copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates to storage\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing iron and copper plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in sequence:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10, -59)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8, -59) \n- Burner mining drill at (-6, -59)\nEach connected to output chests:\n- Wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nConnected by transport belts and burner inserters for item movement\n\n### Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nFour furnace units in sequence:\n- Stone furnace at (0, 0)\n- Stone furnace at (2, 0)\n- Stone furnace at (4, 0) \n- Stone furnace at (6, 0)\nEach with:\n- Input chest and burner inserter above\n- Output chest and burner inserter below\nConnected by burner inserters moving items between chests and furnaces\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Blocked Output Errors\n- Ensure there is a valid destination entity (like a chest or belt) before items are output from drills and inserters\n- Currently seeing blocked outputs at:\n  - Mining drill at (-28, -61)\n  - Inserters at (-9.5, -56.5) and (-5.5, -56.5)\n\n### No Ingredients Errors\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Ensure proper input feed systems are in place before starting smelting operations\n- Check if input inserters are properly fueled and positioned\n\n### Inserter Waiting Errors\n- Several inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify the source inventory (chest/belt/furnace) actually contains items to move\n- Ensure inserters are properly oriented to pick up from source and drop to destination"}
