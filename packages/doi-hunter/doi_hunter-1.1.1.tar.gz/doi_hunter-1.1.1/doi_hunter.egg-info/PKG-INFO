# DoiHunter

**DoiHunter** is a Python package that can helps researchers download research papers using DOIs (unique identification of researcher paper) or paper titles through Crossref and Sci-Hub. Whether you're conducting research or need specific papers quickly, DoiHunter simplifies the process by automating downloads.

## Features

- **Batch Download**: Download multiple research papers in one go using a list of DOIs or titles.
- **Title to DOI**: Retrieves DOIs using paper titles through the CrossRef API and downloads the corresponding papers.
- **Custom File Naming**: Automatically names files based on paper titles for easy identification.
- **Error Handling**: Logs failed downloads and provides detailed summaries after processing.

## Installation

1. First, ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the `doi_hunter` package using pip:

```bash
pip install doi_hunter
````

## Setup & Usage

### Step 1: Create a Directory and Paper Title List

- Create a directory with any name.
- Inside that directory, create a .txt file  form example paper_titles.txt.
- This file should contain a list of paper titles or DOIs, each on a new line.

**Example content for paper_titles.txt:**

- AI Ethics: Balancing Innovation with Privacy and Security in the Digital Age
- 10.1002/er.6529
- Prediction of daily global solar radiation using different machine learning algorithms: Evaluation and comparison

### Step 2: Run the Downloader

Navigate to your created directory, then run the following command:

```bash
python -m doi_hunter paper_titles.txt --batch_size=5
````

## Output

Once the download starts, you'll see the following output:

```bash

[v] File downloaded successfully :)
Processing [2/3]: 10.1002/er.6529
[v] File already exists. Skipping download.

[SUMMARY]
Total papers in file: 2
Total successfully downloaded: 1
Total skipped files: 1
Total failed downloads: 0
````

**Summary of Logs**
At the end of the process, a summary is displayed showing the total number of papers processed, successfully downloaded, skipped (if they already exist), and failed downloads.

## Notes

The ```--batch_size``` option allows you to control how many papers are processed at once, useful for large datasets.
The doi of the research paper must start like this **10.1016/j.rser.2016.05.022**
Failed downloads are logged and can be retried later.
