{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Connected via pipes from positions (x=19.5, y=-2.5) to (x=22.5, y=-3.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=22.5, y=-4.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (x=-2.5, y=0.5), (x=-2.5, y=1.5), (x=-2.5, y=2.5), and (x=-3.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 6750) for steam, starting at position (x=21.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 6747) for water, starting at position (x=5.5, y=-8.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 6751) for water, starting at position (x=18.5, y=-3.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=24.5, y=-7.5), (x=-1.5, y=0.5), and (x=4.5, y=-5.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities with Pipes\n- Ensure that all connection points are correctly aligned and accessible before attempting to connect entities with pipes. Verify that there are no obstructions or incorrect orientations that could prevent a successful connection.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the inserter has access to source items. Check the source inventory and ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source item location.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Furnaces require input materials to function. Ensure that the necessary ingredients are available and properly fed into the furnace to avoid idle time and inefficiency."}
