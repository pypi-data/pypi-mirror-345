For example, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when Assembling Machines Lack Ingredients\n- Check that all necessary ingredients are available in the required quantities before starting production in assembling machines. For instance, make sure there are enough copper plates for copper cable production.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. If an inserter is waiting for source items, ensure the supply chain is not disrupted."}
