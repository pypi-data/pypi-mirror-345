{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (4.5, -58.5) storing iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests storing iron ore and iron plates at various positions:\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (5.5, -60.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -60.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -60.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (9.5, -60.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (8.5, -60.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-5.5, -52.5) with iron ore.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, -50.5) with iron ore.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -50.5) with iron ore.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-12.5, -50.5) with iron ore.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, -50.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-10.5, -50.5) empty.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-9.5, -50.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-8.5, -50.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-7.5, -50.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-6.5, -50.5) with iron plates.\n  - Iron Chest at Position (-6.5, -50.5) empty.\n  - Iron Chest at Position (-5.5, -50.5) with iron ore and iron plates.\n- Stone Furnaces at Positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting. The chest at Position (4.5, -58.5) is full, which stops the mining drill from continuing operations.\n\n### Errors with Smelting Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The stone furnaces at Positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) have warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply these furnaces with iron ore to maintain production efficiency.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_plate_inventory: int` - Represents the total number of iron plates in the inventory, currently 5974.\n  - `iron_gear_wheel_inventory: int` - Represents the total number of iron gear wheels in the inventory, currently 4.\n  - `wooden_chest_count: int` - Represents the total number of wooden chests in the inventory, currently 4."}
