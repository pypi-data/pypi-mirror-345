{"content": "I notice a pattern in the errors - we keep trying to insert iron ore when we don't have any in our inventory. Let's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nLet's focus on what we can do with our current resources:\n1. Check current inventory\n2. Craft iron gear wheels with existing plates\n3.

Add coal to furnaces if needed and available\n5. Avoid trying to insert iron ore when we don't have any", "summary_range": "[1-202]"}
