{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- **Cannot Place Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, or Transport Belt at Desired Location**\n  - Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placing the entity. Check for any existing entities or obstacles before attempting to place new structures.\n\n### Errors When Moving Entities\n- **Cannot Move Stone Furnace to Desired Location**\n  - Verify that the destination is clear and can accommodate the entity's dimensions. Ensure there are no obstructions or existing entities at the target location.\n\n### Errors When Extracting or Interacting with Entities\n- **Could Not Get Prototype.StoneFurnace at Specified Position**\n  - Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified coordinates before attempting to interact with it. Ensure that the entity exists and is correctly identified in the game environment.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Cleared Items from Drill's Drop Position**\n  - Regularly clear items from the drop position of drills to prevent output blockage and maintain continuous operation. Consider placing a sink entity to automatically collect items.\n"}
