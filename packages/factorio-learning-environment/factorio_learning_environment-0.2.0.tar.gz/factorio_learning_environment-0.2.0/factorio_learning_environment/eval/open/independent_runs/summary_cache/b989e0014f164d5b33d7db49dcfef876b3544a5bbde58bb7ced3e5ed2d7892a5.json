{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Although several steps attempted to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), none succeeded because the lab item was not available in inventory. All final outputs confirm that no entities exist on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Invocation Errors with get_entities  \n\u2003\u2013 Using get_entities({Prototype.Lab}, Position(x=0.5, y=2.5), radius=5) produced an error due to the unexpected keyword argument \u201cradius\u201d.  \n\u2003\u2013 A later call with three positional arguments (Position and a numeric value) also failed because the API did not expect any arguments.  \n\u2003\u2003Tip: Verify the function signature and supply only those parameters that are supported.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Multiple attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed because no lab is available in the inventory.  \n\u2003\u2003Tip: Always confirm that the required structure item is present in your inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Iteration over a NoneType  \n\u2003\u2013 When filtering for labs (by iterating over the result of get_entities), the code encountered a \u201cNoneType is not iterable\u201d error.  \n\u2003\u2003Tip: Ensure that, if no entities are found, the returned value is safely handled (for example, by defaulting to an empty list) rather than being None.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Chain Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Crafting attempts for the Lab failed due to missing sub-ingredients. Initial errors pointed out shortages of iron-gear-wheels (stemming from an insufficient iron-plate supply) and later, missing components (such as iron-gear-wheel x2).  \n\u2003\u2013 Additionally, failures in producing necessary intermediate items (like copper-cable and electronic-circuit) indicate gaps in the production chain.  \n\u2003\u2003Tip: Before initiating lab crafting, verify that all prerequisites in the production chain (e.g., sufficient iron-plates, copper-plates, and the ability to smelt or assemble sub-ingredients) are in place and adequately stocked."}
