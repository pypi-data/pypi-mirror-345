Verify the target location is clear of obstructions.\n- Avoid placing pipe-to-ground where the entity footprint overlaps water. Choose a different location that is suitable for placement.\n- Maintain an adequate inventory of pipes before attempting to place them. Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory.\n\n### Connection Failures\n- Verify that the underground pipes are correctly aligned and within connection range to ensure successful connections between them.\n\n### Electricity Network Issues\n- Ensure that all electricity-related entities are properly connected to the electric network to avoid the NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK status."}
