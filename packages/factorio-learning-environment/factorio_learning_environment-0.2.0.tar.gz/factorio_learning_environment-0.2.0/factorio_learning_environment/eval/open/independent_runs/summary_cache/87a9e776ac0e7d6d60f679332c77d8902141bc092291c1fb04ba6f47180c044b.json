{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-7.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump (position -7.5, 25.5)\n- Connected to multiple pipes (positions -7.5, 24.5), (-6.5, 24.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-6.5, 23.5)\n\n### Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Connected to multiple pipes (positions -6.5, 23.5), (-2.5, 21.5), (-2.5, 22.5), (-2.5, 23.5), (-6.5, 24.5), (-4.5, 24.5), (-5.5, 24.5), (-3.5, 24.5)\n\n### Steam Engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n- Connected to multiple small electric poles (positions -1.5, -11.5), (-0.5, -11.5), (1.5, -11.5), (1.5, -10.5), (-2.5, -9.5), (-2.5, -8.5), (1.5, -9.5)\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Lab at position(unknown)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position unknown)\n\n### Furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the offshore pump and boiler are correctly aligned for pipe connections. The error indicates a failure to connect pipes due to incorrect positioning.\n\n### Errors related to boiler fueling\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in inventory to fuel the boiler. The boiler status indicates it is out of fuel, which prevents it from functioning.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
