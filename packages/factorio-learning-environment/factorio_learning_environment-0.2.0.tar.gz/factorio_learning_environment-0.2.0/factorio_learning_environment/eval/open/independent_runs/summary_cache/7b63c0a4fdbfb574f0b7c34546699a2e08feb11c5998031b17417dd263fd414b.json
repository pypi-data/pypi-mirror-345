{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Responsible for mining iron ore. Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores mined iron ore. Currently contains 9 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. Requires coal for operation.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Operation\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning indicates potential misalignment or setup issues.\n- Regularly refuel the inserter with coal to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner mining drill and inserter to prevent interruptions in mining and transferring operations.\n- Ensure the chest at the drop position is emptied regularly to prevent mining stoppages due to a full chest.\n\n### Errors in Resource Flow\n- Monitor the iron ore levels in the chest and ensure it is not empty or low to maintain a steady supply to the furnace.\n- Verify the setup of the inserter to ensure it is correctly configured to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace receives iron ore from the inserter to begin smelting operations. Check the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving ore.\n- Regularly check the furnace for the presence of ingredients to smelt and refuel it with coal as needed."}
