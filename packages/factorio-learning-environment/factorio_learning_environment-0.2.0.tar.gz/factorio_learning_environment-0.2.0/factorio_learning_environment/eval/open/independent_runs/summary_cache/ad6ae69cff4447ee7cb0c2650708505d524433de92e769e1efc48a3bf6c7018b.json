{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items between entities.\n\n### Belt Group at Position (-26.5, -65.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Transport Belts from position (-26.5, -65.5) to (-24.5, -65.5) and from (-25.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -65.5) for transporting materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Inspecting Inventory of Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the transport belt has an accessible inventory before attempting to inspect it. This may involve checking the belt's status and ensuring it is not empty or inactive.\n\n### Assertion Error with Inserter Status\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly fueled and positioned to operate. Ensure it is not obstructed and has a valid source and destination for items."}
