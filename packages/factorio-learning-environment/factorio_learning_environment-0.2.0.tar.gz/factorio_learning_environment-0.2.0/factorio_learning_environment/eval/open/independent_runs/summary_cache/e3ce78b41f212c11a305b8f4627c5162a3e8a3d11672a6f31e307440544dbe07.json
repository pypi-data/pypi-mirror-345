{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) that transfers items from the chest to the furnace\n\n### Coal Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) that transfers items from the chest to the furnace\n\n### Additional Iron Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have enough items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, the error \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" suggests that the agent attempted to insert iron ore into a furnace without having any in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full output chests. For instance, the warning \"chest at drop position is full\" indicates that the mining drill cannot continue because the chest is full.\n\n### Errors when inserting into furnaces without ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients for smelting to avoid the status \"no ingredients to smelt\". This can be mitigated by checking the furnace's inventory before attempting to insert items."}
