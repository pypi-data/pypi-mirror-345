{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 3})\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or incorrect locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities like Burner Inserters, Transport Belts, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables in scripts\n- Verify that all variables used in scripts are properly defined and initialized before use. For example, ensure that `ore_furnace` is defined before referencing it.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources for operations\n- Ensure that sufficient resources are available in the inventory before attempting operations that require them, such as inserting coal into a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors when output is blocked\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or appropriate mechanism in place to accept outputs from entities like drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without available resources\n- Check inventory levels to confirm the availability of resources like coal before attempting to insert them into entities."}
