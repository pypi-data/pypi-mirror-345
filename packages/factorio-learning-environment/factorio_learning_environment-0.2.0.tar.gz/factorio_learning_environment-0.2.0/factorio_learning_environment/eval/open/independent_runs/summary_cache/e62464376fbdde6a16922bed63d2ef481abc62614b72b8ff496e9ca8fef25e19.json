{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Collection chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n- Inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0)\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing Complex (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Collection chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for material movement at (-6.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -56.5), (-4.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -56.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting the mining area\n\n### Iron Smelting Line (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for loading/unloading at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5), (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n\n### Additional Smelting Area (-23, -58)\nConsists of:\n- Three stone furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0), (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Collection chest at (-24.5, -58.5)\n- Output chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n- Burner inserters at (-25.5, -58.5), (-22.5, -56.5), (-20.5, -59.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - a wooden chest was blocking placement of a burner inserter at (-27, -59.5)\n\n### Inserter Output Issues\n- Ensure there is a valid destination entity for inserters to output items to\n- Some inserters are showing \"waiting for space in destination\" errors due to missing or full output containers\n\n### Resource Management\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - ensure proper input material flow\n- Several inserters waiting for source items - verify input supply chain is working correctly\n\n### Transport System Design\n- Some belt groups are showing as empty - verify proper connectivity and material flow between mining and processing areas"}
