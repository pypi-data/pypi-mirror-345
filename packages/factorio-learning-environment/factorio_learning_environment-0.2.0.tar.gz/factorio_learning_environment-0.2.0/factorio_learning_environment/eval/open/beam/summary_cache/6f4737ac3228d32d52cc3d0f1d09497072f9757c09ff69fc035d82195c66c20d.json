{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe extraction of Iron Plates from the active furnace has been successfully completed, resulting in the following outcomes:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace is now empty, with no items remaining inside.\n- The status has changed to **\"NO_INGREDIENTS\"**, indicating that the furnace is not processing any materials due to the absence of required inputs.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **1 piece of stone** remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available (after extraction).\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is currently not able to smelt anything as it lacks the necessary ingredients.\n- The previous attempts to load stone and Copper Ore did not succeed in engaging the furnace, which is now empty and awaiting new inputs.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Reinsert Stone**: Load the **1 piece of stone** into the furnace.\n2. **Load Copper Ore**: After the stone is inserted, load the **1 piece of Copper Ore** to check if the furnace recognizes the inputs and begins processing.\n3. **Monitor for Smelting Activity**: Observe the furnace's status after each insertion to ensure it transitions to a \"WORKING\" state.\n\nLet's proceed by reinserting the stone into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the remaining stone into the active furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Insert the 1 piece of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_stone_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading stone: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading stone: {overall_inventory_after_stone_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-326]"}
