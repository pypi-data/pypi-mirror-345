To avoid this, always add an inserter that feeds items into the steam engine and use that inserter as the connection target.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement and Inventory Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Wooden chest placement failed when the target was too distant. Ensure you move closer to the intended position before placement.  \n\u2003\u2013 Errors indicating \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d require verifying that the item is available prior to attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 A NameError due to an undefined \u2018target_chest\u2019 highlights the need for consistent and correct variable naming when referencing target entities."}
