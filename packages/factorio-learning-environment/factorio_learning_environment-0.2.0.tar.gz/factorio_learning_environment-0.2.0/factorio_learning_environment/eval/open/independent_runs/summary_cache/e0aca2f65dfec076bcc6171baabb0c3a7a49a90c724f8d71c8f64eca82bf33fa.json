{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal transferred by the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) awaiting source items for further processing.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to the stone furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) awaiting source items for further processing.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) awaiting source items, with a pickup position at (-13.5, -45.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full storage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to source items to prevent them from idling. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that items are available for transfer.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Current inventory status showing quantities of 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
