{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0)\n  - Fueled by coal and currently working.\n  - Connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, y=-58.5) which stores extracted iron ore.\n  - Warning: The chest at drop position is full, preventing further mining.\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, y=-48.0) working with a source of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, y=-48.0) working with a source of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** and **Iron Chests** at various positions (e.g., x=-14.5, y=-50.5 to x=-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron plates and other resources.\n  - Some chests are full, specifically those storing iron plates, which may require attention to prevent overflow.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Regularly check and supply stone furnaces with the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to maintain continuous smelting operations.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined in the current logs.\n\n- **Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_count: int` - Represents the number of iron ores extracted and inserted into furnaces.\n  - `iron_plate_count: int` - Represents the number of iron plates extracted from furnaces and stored in chests.\n  - `coal_count: int` - Represents the amount of coal inserted into the burner mining drill. \n\nThis report provides a concise overview of the current structures and operations on the map, along with actionable tips to address existing issues and improve efficiency."}
