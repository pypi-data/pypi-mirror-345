{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for additional storage.\n- Transport belt connecting the mining drill to the storage chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for transferring items into the furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Transport belt and inserters facilitating the movement of materials.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) for transferring items into the furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) for storing copper plates.\n- Transport belt and inserters facilitating the movement of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the target entity has sufficient inventory of the item you wish to extract. If the inventory is empty or does not contain the specified item, extraction will fail.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent blockages in production. A full chest will halt the operation of connected entities like mining drills.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities have items available for inserters to transfer. If the source is empty, the inserter will remain idle and production will be delayed."}
