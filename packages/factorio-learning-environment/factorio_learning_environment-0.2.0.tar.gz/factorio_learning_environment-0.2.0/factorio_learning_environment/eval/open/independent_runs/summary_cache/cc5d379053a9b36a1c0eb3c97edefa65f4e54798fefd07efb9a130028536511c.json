{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -52.0) with fuel (coal: 1) and currently working, producing copper plates.\n- Furnace at position (63.0, -52.0) without fuel and currently not working, producing copper plates.\n- Furnace at position (65.0, -52.0) with fuel (coal: 40) but currently not working due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Copper ore mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x1) and a furnace at position (y1).\n- Burner mining drill at position (x2) and a furnace at position (y2).\n- Burner mining drill at position (x3) and a furnace at position (y3).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to furnace operations\n- Check the fuel status of furnaces before attempting to insert materials. If a furnace is out of fuel, it will not operate.\n- Ensure that there are sufficient ingredients available for the furnace to work. If there are no ingredients, the furnace will not operate."}
