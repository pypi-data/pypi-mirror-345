{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Boiler at position(-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at position(4.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups with fluid systems 46720 and 46721\n- Small electric poles forming electricity network (group ID 162631)\nCurrent status: System experiencing power issues, boiler out of fuel\n\n### Manufacturing Complex\n1. Original Assembler at position(23.5, 2.5)\n- Assembling machine producing inserters\n- Two burner inserters at positions(21.5, 2.5) and (25.5, 2.5)\n- Two wooden chests at positions(20.5, 2.5) and (26.5, 2.5)\nCurrent status: No power, missing resources\n\n2. Logistics Science Pack Assembler at position(32.5, 5.5)\n- Assembling machine configured for logistics science pack production\n- Connected to power network via small electric pole at (30.5, 7.5)\nCurrent status: No power, missing resources\n\n### Smelting Area\n- Three furnaces at positions(0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0)\n- Additional furnaces at positions(4.0, 4.0), (6.0, 4.0)\nCurrent status: Most furnaces idle due to no ingredients\n\n### Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs present with various science pack inputs\n- Lab at position(-0.5, 19.5)\n- Several other labs connected to electricity group 162631\nCurrent status: No active research, some labs lacking power\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Ensure steam engine is properly connected to the power network before attempting to power other entities\n- When connecting new entities to power, verify the electricity group exists before attempting to access it\n\n### Resource Management\n- Check inventory for required materials before attempting insertion operations\n- Ensure coal supply is maintained for boiler operation to prevent power outages\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- When reconnecting steam systems, verify all fluid connections are properly established\n- Ensure power poles are properly placed to create continuous electrical networks\n\n### Research Issues\n- Cannot set research targets that are already completed\n- Verify research prerequisites are met before attempting to start new research\n- Ensure labs have both power and required science packs before attempting research\n\n### Assembly Line Optimization\n- Verify all required components are available before starting assembly processes\n- Ensure assemblers have power before attempting to add ingredients\n- Check recipe requirements match available resources before starting production"}
