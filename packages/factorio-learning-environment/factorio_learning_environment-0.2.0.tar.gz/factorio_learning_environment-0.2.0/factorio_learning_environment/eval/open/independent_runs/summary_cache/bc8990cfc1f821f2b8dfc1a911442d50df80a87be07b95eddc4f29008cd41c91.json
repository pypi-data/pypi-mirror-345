{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a status of 'out of fuel'.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) which is operational and supplying water.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with various pipes at positions such as (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=3.5, y=17.5).\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=88348) at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) is currently empty.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=88359) at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) is full and transporting water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=221279) with poles at various positions such as (x=30.5, y=17.5) and (x=20.5, y=19.5), currently with no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that all entities meant to be connected by pipes are aligned and within reach. Verify that there are no obstructions or incorrect connections between the boiler and the steam engine.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to ensure continuous operation. Refuel them timely to avoid disruptions.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Input\n- Verify that the steam engine is correctly connected to a boiler with a sufficient supply of steam. Ensure that all necessary pipes are in place and properly connected."}
