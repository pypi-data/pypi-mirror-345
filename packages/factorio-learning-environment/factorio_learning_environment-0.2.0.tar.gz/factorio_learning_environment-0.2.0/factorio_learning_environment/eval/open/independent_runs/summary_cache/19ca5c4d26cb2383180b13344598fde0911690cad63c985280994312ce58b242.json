{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 26.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 26.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (35.5, 27.5)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, including underground pipes at positions (16.0, 23.5) and (20.0, 23.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserters positioned to feed coal into the furnaces\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5) for storage and transfer of materials\n\n### Research Lab at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Underground Pipe Placement\n- Ensure the correct attribute is used for underground pipes. The attribute 'PipeToGround' does not exist; consider using 'PipeGroup'.\n- Verify that there is no obstruction or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water) at the target location before placing underground pipes.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Before placing pipes, ensure that the target location is clear of existing objects or unplaceable terrain.\n- Verify that there is a suitable position for pipe placement to avoid obstruction errors.\n\n### Steam Engine Connectivity Issues\n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and receiving steam. Check all pipe connections and ensure they are correctly aligned and unobstructed.\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is supplying water to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Boiler Fueling Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel the boiler. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain boiler operation."}
