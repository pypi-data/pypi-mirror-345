{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) with various connections\n- PipeGroup at position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) with water fluid\n- PipeGroup at position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) with water fluid\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=21.5, y=-14.5), (x=18.5, y=-15.5), (x=10.5, y=-10.5), and (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that all pipe connections are properly aligned and that there are no gaps between the entities you are trying to connect. Verify the positions of the entities and ensure they are adjacent to each other for a successful connection.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Supply\n- Make sure to supply fuel to the boiler to maintain its operation. Check the fuel levels regularly and replenish them as needed to avoid disruptions in energy production.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Flow\n- Ensure that the fluid systems are correctly set up to allow the flow of water from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine. Check for any blockages or incorrect pipe placements that may hinder fluid movement."}
