{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of four stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at position (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have coal as fuel but currently have no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-2.5, 24.0), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at position (4.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler (fluid system 83)\n- Pipe network connecting boiler to steam engine (fluid system 85)\n- Small electric pole at position (6.5, 24.5)\nSystem is partially operational - pump is working but boiler needs fuel\n\n### Research Lab\nLab at position (10.5, 0.5) with:\n- 2 automation science packs loaded\n- Connected to power network\n- Currently in working status\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory management errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to craft or place entities\n- Check if raw materials need to be gathered or smelted before attempting to craft items that require processed materials\n\n### Recipe chain errors\n- Some items like copper plates and iron plates must be smelted in furnaces before they can be used in crafting\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered, they cannot be crafted\n\n### Building placement errors\n- Verify you have the required item in inventory before attempting to place structures\n- When connecting entities with pipes or other connectors, ensure you have the connecting items in inventory\n\n### Type errors in building calculations\n- Building dimensions should be accessed directly rather than through prototype attributes\n- Avoid arithmetic operations with incompatible types (ModelPrivateAttr + int)\n\n### Power system setup\n- Ensure all components of power system (boiler, steam engine, electric poles) are properly connected\n- Keep boiler fueled to maintain power generation"}
