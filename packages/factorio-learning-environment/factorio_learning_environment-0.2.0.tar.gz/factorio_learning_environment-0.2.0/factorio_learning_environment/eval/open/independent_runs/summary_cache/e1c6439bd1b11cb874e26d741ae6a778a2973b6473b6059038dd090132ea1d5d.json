{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\nLocated around position (8.5, 13.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at (8.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear inserter at (8.5, 9.5)\n- Iron gear chest at (8.5, 8.5) containing iron gears\n- Transport belt system starting at (8.5, 11.5)\n- Wooden chest at (11.5, 13.5)\n- Burner inserter at (10.5, 13.5)\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-4.5, 12.5), consists of:\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected pipe networks for water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting various entities\n\n### Iron Production Lines\nMultiple iron smelting setups:\n1. First setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n- Burner mining drill\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n- Output inserter at (-23.5, -58.5)\n- Storage chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n2. Second setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n- Burner mining drill\n- Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n- Output inserter at (-13.5, -50.5)\n- Storage chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\nLocated at (41.0, -82.0):\n- Burner mining drill\n- Storage chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - multiple attempts to place inserters and chests failed due to occupied tiles\n- When placing entities next to transport belts, ensure proper spacing or choose a different direction\n- Consider the full dimensions of larger entities (like furnaces) when placing items nearby\n\n### Spacing Issues\n- Increase spacing parameter when placing entities if initial placement fails\n- Pay attention to direction when placing inserters - they need clear space for both pickup and drop positions\n\n### Structure Planning\n- Plan the layout considering the space needed for all components before placing entities\n- Consider the complete production line flow to avoid blocking future expansions\n- When reorganizing production lines, remove all conflicting entities before placing new ones\n\n### Electric Pole Conflicts\n- Avoid placing inserters where electric poles already exist\n- Consider repositioning electric poles if they block essential production line components"}
