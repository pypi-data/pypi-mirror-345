{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the structures and error tips:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) collecting coal output\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) collecting copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0) for smelting\n- Input chest at (22.5, 21.5) holding copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 20.5) to feed furnace\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) collecting copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving finished plates to output chest\n\n### Iron Processing Line at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) collecting iron ore\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0) for smelting\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Issues\n- Ensure required materials (like coal) are in inventory before attempting to insert them into entities\n- Monitor chest capacities - full chests will stop mining operations\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper connection between input storage and furnace via inserters\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices regularly\n- Check inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly configured for material flow\n\n### Resource Flow Problems\n- Verify the complete production chain is properly connected (miner \u2192 chest \u2192 inserter \u2192 furnace \u2192 inserter \u2192 output chest)\n- Ensure inserters are oriented correctly to pick up from source and drop at destination"}
