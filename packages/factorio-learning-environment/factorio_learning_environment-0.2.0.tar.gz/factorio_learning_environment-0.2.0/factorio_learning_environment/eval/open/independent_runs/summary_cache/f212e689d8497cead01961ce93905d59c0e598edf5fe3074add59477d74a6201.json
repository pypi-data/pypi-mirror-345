{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Station at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Wooden chest for coal storage (position x=23.5, y=-16.5)\n\n###Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Wooden chest for iron ore storage (position x=-14.5, y=21.5)\n\n###Copper Processing Line at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill for copper ore (position x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=19.5, y=21.5)\n- Wooden chest for copper ore storage (position x=20.5, y=21.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=24.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden chest for copper plate storage (position x=24.5, y=17.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=24.5, y=18.5)\n- Intermediate wooden chest (position x=22.5, y=20.5)\n\n###Unused Furnaces\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- Position x=-11.0, y=20.0\n- Position x=-9.0, y=20.0\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing structures\n- Consider using different spacing or direction if initial placement fails\n\n###Belt Connection Errors\n- Ensure there is a clear path for belt placement between source and destination\n- Check if the proposed belt path doesn't intersect with existing entities\n- Verify that the belt endpoints are at valid positions that can be connected\n\n###Entity Operational Issues\n- Some mining drills are out of fuel - ensure consistent fuel supply\n- Furnaces have no ingredients to smelt - verify the input logistics chain is working\n- Some furnaces have excess fuel but no materials to process - balance the resource input"}
