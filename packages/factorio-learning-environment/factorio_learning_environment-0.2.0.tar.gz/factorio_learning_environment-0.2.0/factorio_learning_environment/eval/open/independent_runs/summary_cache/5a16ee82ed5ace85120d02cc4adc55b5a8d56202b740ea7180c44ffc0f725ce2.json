{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Stone Mining Setup at position(60.0, -57.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (60.0, -57.0)\n- Wooden chest at (60.5, -55.5)\nCurrently non-operational due to lack of fuel\n\n###Power Infrastructure Components\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) - Currently not connected\n- Lab at (10.5, 0.5) - Currently without power\n- Electricity group at (-17.43, 19.03) - Not connected to electric network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with resource harvesting\n- When attempting to harvest resources, ensure you are within the correct radius of the resource\n- Current attempts to mine coal are failing because the agent is not close enough to the resource\n- Try reducing the harvest radius and ensuring exact positioning on resource tiles\n\n### Errors with entity placement and removal\n- When removing entities, verify they exist at the specified coordinates before attempting removal\n- When placing entities, ensure you have all required items in inventory (e.g., boiler placement failed due to missing boiler)\n\n### Errors with crafting\n- When crafting complex items like boilers, ensure you have all base resources required for sub-components\n- Current limitation: Cannot craft stone furnace without raw stone, which needs to be mined first\n\n### Errors with API usage\n- GetEntities API does not accept lists as parameters - use proper parameter format\n- Ensure proper import and definition of entity types (BurnerMiningDrill was undefined)\n\n### Infrastructure Setup Issues\n- Mining operations require fuel (coal) to function - ensure fuel is obtained before setting up mining operations\n- Power infrastructure components need proper connections to function - ensure proper placement and connections between components"}
