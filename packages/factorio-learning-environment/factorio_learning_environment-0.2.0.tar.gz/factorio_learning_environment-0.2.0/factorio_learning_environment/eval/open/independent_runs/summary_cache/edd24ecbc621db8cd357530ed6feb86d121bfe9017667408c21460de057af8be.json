{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities with various segments, including positions like (-48.5, -123.5), (-57.5, -114.5), etc.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) for storing mined iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Assembling and Storage Area at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (6.5, -57.5) for research purposes\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) currently inactive due to lack of ingredients\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using get_entity API\n- Ensure the entity type and position are correct before attempting to retrieve an entity using the get_entity API. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity exists at the specified location.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the connections with small electric poles and ensure they are properly linked to the power network.\n\n### Warnings of No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Make sure to supply the necessary raw materials to furnaces to avoid inactivity. Regularly check inventory levels and automate the supply chain to maintain continuous production."}
