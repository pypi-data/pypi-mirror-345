{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=53.5, y=-80.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (x=53.5, y=-80.5) to another chest at (x=52.5, y=-78.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-76.5) connected to a chest at position (x=52.5, y=-77.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting System at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) dropping mined iron ore into a wooden chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) receiving iron ore from the chest at (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) and smelting it into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) transferring items from the chest at (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (x=-8.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) awaiting source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest\n- Ensure that chests receiving mined resources have enough space to accommodate new items. Regularly empty chests to prevent mining stoppages.\n\n### Errors due to Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that source items are available for inserters to transfer.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `fuel` (type: Inventory): Represents the fuel inventory for various entities like Burner Mining Drills and Burner Inserters.\n- `inventory` (type: Inventory): Represents the inventory of chests and other storage entities.\n- `energy` (type: float): Represents the energy level of entities like Burner Inserters and Stone Furnaces.\n- `status` (type: EntityStatus): Represents the operational status of entities, such as WORKING or WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS."}
