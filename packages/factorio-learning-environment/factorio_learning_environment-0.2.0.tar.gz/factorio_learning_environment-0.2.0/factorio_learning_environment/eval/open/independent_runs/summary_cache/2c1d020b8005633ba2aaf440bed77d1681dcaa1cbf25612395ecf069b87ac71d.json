{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel.\n- **Iron Chest**: \n  - Iron chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) used for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with coal fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Positioned at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n  - Multiple wooden chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), and (x=8.5, y=-60.5) for general storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Non-existent Items\n- Ensure that the item you are trying to extract exists in the specified container. For example, attempting to extract coal from an iron chest that does not contain coal will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to prevent halting of production processes. For instance, the chest at drop position (4.5, y=-58.5) is full, which stops the mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **extract_item**: \n  - Function call: `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, iron_chest, quantity=10)`\n  - Failure Mode: Attempted to extract coal from an iron chest that does not contain coal. Ensure the correct item type is being extracted from the correct container.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_coal`: Intended to store extracted coal, but failed due to incorrect extraction attempt.\n- Inventory variables:\n  - `iron-ore`: Integer, current count is 142.\n  - `iron-plate`: Integer, current count is 4548.\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: Integer, current count is 4.\n  - `wood`: Integer, current count is 10."}
