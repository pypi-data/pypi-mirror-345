{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has not successfully placed any entities or constructed any structures during the initial steps.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the tile where you intend to place an entity is not already occupied by another entity. Attempting to place entities like Transport Belts, Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Burner Inserters on occupied tiles will result in placement errors.\n\n### Errors with entity placement at specific coordinates\n- Double-check the coordinates before attempting to place entities. The agent attempted to place entities at coordinates such as x=65.0 y=-105.0, x=5.0 y=5.0, x=-50.0 y=50.0, x=0.0 y=10.0, x=10.0 y=0.0, x=-100.0 y=100.0, and x=0.0 y=0.0, which resulted in errors. Ensure that these coordinates are valid and available for placement.\n\n### General placement strategy\n- Before placing any entity, verify that the area is clear and suitable for the intended structure. Consider the overall layout and connectivity of the structures to avoid unnecessary errors and optimize the construction process."}
