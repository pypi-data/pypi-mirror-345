{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to place the Stone Furnace failed again because the target position was too far from the player's current position. \n\nTo resolve this, I need to ensure that I am within the maximum placement distance before trying to place any entities.

After gathering iron ore, I will place the Stone Furnace at a valid position.\n3. Then, I will smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n4.
