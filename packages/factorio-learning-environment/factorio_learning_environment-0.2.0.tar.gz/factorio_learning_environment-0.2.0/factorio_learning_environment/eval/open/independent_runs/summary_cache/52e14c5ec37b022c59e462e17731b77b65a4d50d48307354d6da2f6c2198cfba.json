{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to two Wooden Chests at positions (x=52.5, y=-84.5) and (x=54.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) with a drop position at (x=-23.5, y=-69.5), connected to Wooden Chests at positions (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) and (x=-24.5, y=-67.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), connected to a Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) and Wooden Chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System at Position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-16.5, y=-69.5) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (x=-17.5, y=-69.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-69.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-15.5, y=-64.5) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-64.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and another at position (x=5.0, y=0.0).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=3.5, y=0.5), connected by a Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, the error at position (-5.0, -30.0) occurred because there was no wooden chest available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources\n- Verify that you have all necessary resources before attempting to craft an item. The crafting error for the wooden chest indicates a lack of sufficient resources or incorrect crafting logic.\n\n### Errors due to full chests blocking operations\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills and inserters from being blocked. For instance, the chest at (-23.5, -69.5) is full, preventing further mining operations.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity for an inserter has items available for transfer. The inserter at (x=2.5, y=0.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a possible blockage or empty source."}
