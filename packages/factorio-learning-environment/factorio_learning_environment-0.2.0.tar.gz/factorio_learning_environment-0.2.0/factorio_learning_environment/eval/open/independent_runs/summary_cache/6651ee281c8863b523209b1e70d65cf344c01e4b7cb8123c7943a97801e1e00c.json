{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at position(-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position(-12.0, -51.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position(-14.0, -49.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position(-11.5, -48.5) which transfers iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position(-8.5, -49.5) for storing processed iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position(-13.5, -46.5) which transfers items from the furnace to the wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position(-13.5, -45.5) for additional storage\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at position(52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position(52.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position(52.5, -79.5) which is intended to transfer coal from the mining drill\n- Wooden Chest at position(52.5, -77.5) for storing mined coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in Stone Furnace\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to operate. Regularly check and refill the furnace with the required materials.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in Burner Mining Drills\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of Burner Mining Drills and ensure they are refueled with coal or other appropriate fuel sources to maintain operation.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a clear path for output items from mining drills and furnaces. Use inserters and chests effectively to manage output flow and prevent blockages.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int, current amount in inventory is 67\n  - `iron-plate`: int, current amount in inventory is 212"}
