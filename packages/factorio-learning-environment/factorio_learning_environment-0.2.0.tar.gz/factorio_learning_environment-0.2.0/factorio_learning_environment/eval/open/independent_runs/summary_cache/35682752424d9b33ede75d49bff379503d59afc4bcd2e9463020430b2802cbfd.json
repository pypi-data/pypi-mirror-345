{"content": "I'll create a new report based on these execution logs.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around position x=42, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Transport belt at position (41.5, -80.5) facing DOWN\n- Burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Stone furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) facing UP\n\nThe structure appears to be attempting to create a coal processing line, but is currently not functioning optimally due to positioning issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- When placing transport belts or inserters, ensure the target location is completely clear of other entities\n- Use place_entity_next_to with appropriate spacing parameters to avoid overlap with existing structures\n- Check for existing entities before attempting to place new ones\n\n### Belt and Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Ensure belts and inserters are properly aligned with their input/output positions\n- When connecting multiple entities, verify that the chain of connections (belt -> inserter -> furnace) is properly aligned\n- Pay attention to entity facing directions to ensure proper material flow\n\n### Space Management\n- Leave adequate space between large entities (like mining drills and furnaces) for inserters and belts\n- Consider the full size of entities (e.g., mining drill is 2x2, furnace is 2x2) when planning layouts\n- When using place_entity_next_to, adjust the spacing parameter if initial placement fails\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities at specific coordinates\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places entities adjacent to existing ones with specified spacing\n\nImportant Variables:\n- belt2: TransportBelt\n- inserter: BurnerInserter\n\nFunction Outcomes:\n- place_entity(): Fails when target location is occupied\n- place_entity_next_to(): Fails when spacing is insufficient or target area contains existing entities"}
