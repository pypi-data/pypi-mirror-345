{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities have resulted in errors, and the map remains empty of structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent placement errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at x=0.0 y=0.0.\"\n\n### Errors with position handling\n- When moving to a position or using position data, ensure that the data type is handled correctly. Avoid using string indices when integer indices are required, as this can lead to errors like \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'.\"\n- Ensure that position objects are used correctly and avoid treating them as callable functions, which results in errors such as \"'Position' object is not callable.\"\n\n### Errors with building area\n- When attempting to clear or build in an area, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. If no viable place is found, consider decreasing the BuildingBox size or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to accommodate the structures."}
