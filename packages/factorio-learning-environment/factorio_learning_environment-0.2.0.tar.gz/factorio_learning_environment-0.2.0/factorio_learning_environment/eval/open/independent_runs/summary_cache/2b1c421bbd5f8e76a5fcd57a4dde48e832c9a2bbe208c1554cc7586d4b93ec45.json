Multiple attempts were made to craft and place the Lab\u2014but placement failed repeatedly because no Lab item was present in inventory and required sub-ingredients (such as iron\u2010gear wheels, electronic circuits, or copper cables) could not be produced in sufficient quantity. As a result, no Lab exists on the map.\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0)\nUtilized for converting iron ore and coal into iron plates needed for further production. The agent accessed this furnace to insert 10 units each of iron ore and coal, resulting in the extraction of additional iron plates.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\nEmployed for smelting copper ore with coal to produce copper plates that support further copper cable production. The agent retrieved this furnace to process 50 copper ore and coal, yielding 45 copper plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 When using get_entities(), ensure that the call adheres to its defined signature. Do not supply unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or positional arguments if none are expected.\n\u2022 Prior to placing structures, verify that the required inventory item is available. This prevents failures when attempting to deploy a Lab.\n\u2022 Always check that returned entity lists are not None before iterating over them; use a fallback (like an empty list) if necessary.\n\u2022 Ensure that all prerequisites for crafting complex items (for example, a Lab) are met. Confirm that intermediate components such as iron\u2010gear wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables can be produced reliably.\n\u2022 Review resource counts and buffer production as needed. Missing ingredients during Lab crafting suggest that additional resource processing (such as extra smelting runs) is required before attempting the build."}
