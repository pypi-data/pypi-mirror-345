{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0) fueled with coal, intended for smelting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (60.5, -52.5) transferring fuel to the stone furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent errors related to trying to insert non-existent items, such as coal or iron ore.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace will not operate properly if there are no ingredients to process. Ensure that iron ore is available in the furnace's inventory for smelting.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full. A full chest will halt the operation of connected entities, such as mining drills, leading to inefficiencies in resource gathering."}
