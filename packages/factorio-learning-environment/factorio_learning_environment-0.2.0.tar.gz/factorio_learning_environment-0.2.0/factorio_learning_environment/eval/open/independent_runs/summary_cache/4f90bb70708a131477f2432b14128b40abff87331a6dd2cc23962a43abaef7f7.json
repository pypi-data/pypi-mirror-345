{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5), currently working and connected to a stone furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0), currently working and producing iron plates. It contains coal as fuel and iron ore as input material.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to lack of inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a burner mining drill without having it in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Verify that the desired placement location is unoccupied and valid for the entity type before attempting to place it. This includes ensuring there is enough space and that the terrain is suitable for the entity.\n\n### Furnace not producing iron plates\n- Double-check the setup of the furnace to ensure it has the necessary input materials and fuel. Ensure that the furnace is correctly connected to the mining drill and that the input materials are being fed into it properly.\n\n### Errors when placing transport belts\n- Make sure that the transport belt placement is aligned correctly and that there is no obstruction in the path where you intend to place it."}
