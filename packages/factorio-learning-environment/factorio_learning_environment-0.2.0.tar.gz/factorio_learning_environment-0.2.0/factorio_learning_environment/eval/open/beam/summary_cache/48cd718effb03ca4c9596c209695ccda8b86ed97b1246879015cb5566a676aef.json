We should insert iron ore into the first furnace to resume its operation.\n2. If we have enough coal, we can also consider inserting some into the second furnace to get it running as well.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to insert iron ore into the first furnace and check if we need to insert coal for fuel.\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1.
