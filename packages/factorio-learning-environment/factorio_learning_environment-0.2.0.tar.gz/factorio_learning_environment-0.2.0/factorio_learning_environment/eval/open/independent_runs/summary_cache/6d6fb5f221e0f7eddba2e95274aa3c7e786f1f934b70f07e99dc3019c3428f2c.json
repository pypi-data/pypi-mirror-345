{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis facility is responsible for extracting iron ore and converting it into iron plates. The mining drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into the wooden chest. The inserter moves the iron ore from the chest into the stone furnace, where it is smelted into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Production Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis facility is responsible for extracting coal and utilizing it as fuel. The mining drill extracts coal and deposits it into the wooden chest. The inserter moves the coal from the chest into the stone furnace, where it can be used as a fuel source for smelting operations.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or adjusting the reference position if placement fails.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to insert items into a furnace or any other entity, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory to avoid insertion errors."}
