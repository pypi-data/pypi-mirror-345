{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates. The chest at (21.5, 82.5) was removed and replaced with a new chest at the same position to free space for inserters.\n- Burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), both fueled with coal, moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with improved inserter fueling and chest management, though output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Pipe connections between boiler and steam engine successfully established after removal of blocking pipes at (-7.5, -0.5), (-6.5, 2.5), and (-2.5, 6.5).\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 placed at (25.5, 80.5), set to craft iron gear wheels but currently not receiving iron plates, preventing crafting.\n- Input burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding into the assembly area.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) placed and fueled with coal.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) replaced and connected to output inserter.\n- Small electric pole placed near assembler at (25.5, 77.5) and connected to power network at (17.17, 63.83).\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and output inserter properly placed, but lacks input iron plates for operation.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous failures to place burner inserters and poles due to tile occupation were resolved by removing obstructing wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5).\n- Always verify tile occupancy before placing entities; removing or relocating existing entities can free space.\n\n### Inserter fueling and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) were successfully fueled after prior fuel shortages.\n- Ensure continuous monitoring and insertion of fuel into burner inserters to maintain operation.\n- Avoid overfilling inserter inventories to prevent insertion failures.\n\n### Crafting and recipe input shortages\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) remains unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates.\n- Despite output inserter and chest setup, input inventory is empty.\n- To resolve, ensure sufficient iron plates are inserted into the assembler\u2019s input chest at (21.5, 75.5).\n- Maintain supply chain continuity from smelting to assembly inputs.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity\n- Output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position (17.5, 72.5) persists, limiting mining drill throughput.\n- Power network connectivity improved with new poles placed and connected, enabling assembling machine operation.\n- Regularly clear output belts and chests to prevent blockage.\n- Confirm all machines are connected to power network for operation.\n\n### Pipe connection errors and fluid system setup\n- Initial attempts to connect boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) to steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) failed due to blocked pipe connections.\n- Removing obstructing pipes at (-7.5, -0.5), (-6.5, "}
