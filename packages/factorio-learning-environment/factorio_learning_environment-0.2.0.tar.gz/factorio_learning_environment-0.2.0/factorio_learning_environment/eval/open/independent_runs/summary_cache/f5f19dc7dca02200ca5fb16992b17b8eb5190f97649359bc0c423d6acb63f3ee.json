{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with current inventory: {'iron-ore': 2, 'iron-plate': 8}. The furnace is currently fueled with coal and is in a state of no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) fueled with coal and currently mining iron ore. The drill has reported being out of fuel and that the chest at drop position is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) with current inventory: {}. The chest is used to store mined iron ore.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (unknown)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when crafting items due to missing sub-ingredients:\n  - Ensure that all required sub-ingredients for crafting are available in inventory or can be produced with existing structures before attempting to craft.\n  - Specifically, for crafting the Burner Mining Drill, ensure that iron plates and iron gear wheels are available, as they are required sub-ingredients.\n  \n- Errors when attempting to craft items without a crafting machine:\n  - Use a crafting machine or furnace to produce items that require crafting, such as iron plates and iron gear wheels. Ensure that the necessary recipes are available and that the machine has the required ingredients.\n\n- Errors when placing entities too far away:\n  - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 tiles.\n\n- Errors when attempting to place an entity that is not in inventory:\n  - Ensure that the entity you are trying to place is available in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n- Errors related to mining drill status:\n  - Ensure that the chest at the drop position is emptied to allow the mining drill to continue working. The drill cannot operate if the drop position is full.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked yet.\n- Important variables assigned:\n  - `inventory`: dict (e.g., {'wood': 6, 'iron-ore': 18})\n  - `furnace_inventory`: dict (e.g., {'iron-ore': 2, 'iron-plate': 8})"}
