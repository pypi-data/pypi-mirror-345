{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Delivery System at Position (x=52.5, y=-79.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) waiting for space in destination.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=53.5, y=-80.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) adjusted to deliver coal to the chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=52.5, y=-77.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-76.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) currently working.\n- Stone furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) lacking ingredients.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) for additional storage.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inserter Pickup Position Misalignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source chest or entity. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from picking up items, leading to inefficiencies in resource transfer.\n\n### Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination for mined resources has enough space to accommodate incoming items. If a mining drill is waiting for space, consider adding more storage capacity or processing the resources faster.\n\n### No Ingredients in Stone Furnace\n- Check that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to produce items. Ensure a consistent supply of raw materials to avoid production halts.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary containing counts of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', and 'iron-plate'."}
