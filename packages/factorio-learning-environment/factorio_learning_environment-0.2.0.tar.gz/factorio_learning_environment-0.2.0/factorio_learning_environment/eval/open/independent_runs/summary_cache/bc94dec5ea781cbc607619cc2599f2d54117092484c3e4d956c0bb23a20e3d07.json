{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\n### Electricity generator at position (-0.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following interconnected power components:\n\u2022 Steam engine (\u201csteam-engine\u201d) at (-0.5, 24.5)\n\u2022 Boiler at (-5.5, 24.0)\n\u2022 Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper cable factory interface at position (2.5, 17.5)\nServes as the input and conversion point for copper plates into copper cable.\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Cable factory input chest at (2.5, 17.5)\n\u2022 Factory burner inserter placed at (3.5, 17.5) using direction RIGHT \u2013 its neighbours include a burner inserter at (2.5, 16.5) and an assembling machine at (1.5, 19.5)\n\n### Belt depot at position (3.5, 15.5)\nProvides an isolated belt target for connecting the extraction system to the factory interface.\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Wooden chest (belt depot) at (3.5, 15.5)\n\u2022 Dedicated transport belt segment at (4.5, 15.5)\n\u2022 Depot burner inserter placed at (3.5, 14.5) with a pickup position at (3.5, 15.5) and a drop position at (3.5, 13.5)\n\n### Extraction system at position (-3.5, 27.5)\nFunctions as the source side for transferring copper plates.\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Extraction system burner inserter at (-3.5, 27.5) with a drop position at (-3.5, 28.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 Belt Connection Errors  \n  \u2013 Ensure that the target for a transport belt connection is not a steam engine. Instead, route items through an inserter that feeds into the device. Verify the type of the target entity before attempting to connect belts.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Errors  \n  \u2013 Before placing an entity, confirm that the target position is within the maximum allowed distance from the player. Move closer if the calculated distance exceeds the placement limit.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Errors  \n  \u2013 Check that all variable names used (for example, referencing \u201ctarget_chest\u201d) are defined correctly. Ensure consistency in variable naming to avoid NameError issues.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Availability Errors  \n  \u2013 Verify that the required item (such as a wooden chest) is present in the player\u2019s inventory before attempting its placement."}
