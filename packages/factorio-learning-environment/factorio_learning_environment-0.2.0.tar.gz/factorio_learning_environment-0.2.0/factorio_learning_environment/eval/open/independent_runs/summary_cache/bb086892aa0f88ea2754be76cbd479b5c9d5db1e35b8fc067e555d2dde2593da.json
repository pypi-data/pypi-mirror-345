{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -47.0) with coal fuel, intended for smelting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -49.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting a burner mining drill requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary to avoid conflicts, as seen when attempting to place a burner inserter next to an existing stone furnace.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Recipes\n- Gather raw resources directly from the environment if they cannot be crafted. For instance, stone must be gathered as it is a raw resource and cannot be crafted.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Confirm that the inventory contains the items to be inserted into another entity. Attempting to insert items without having them in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors Due to Output Blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity to accept output from production entities like mining drills to prevent blockage warnings."}
