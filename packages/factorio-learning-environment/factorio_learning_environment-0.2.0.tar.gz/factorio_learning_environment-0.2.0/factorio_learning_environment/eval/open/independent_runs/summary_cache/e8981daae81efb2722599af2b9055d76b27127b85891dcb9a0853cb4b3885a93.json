{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with a full output of iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) transferring items from a wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) storing coal and iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the mining drill to the stone furnace, facilitating ore transport.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with iron plates in output.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity (e.g., chest or furnace) has enough space to accept items from the inserter. Consider using additional storage or managing inventory to prevent blockage.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to avoid production halts.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Verify that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Ensure that mining drills are operational and connected to furnaces to maintain a steady input of resources.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a valid sink entity (e.g., chest or belt) to accept the output from inserters. Clear any obstructions that may block the output path."}
