{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), currently working.\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0), initially had no fuel but later was supplied with coal and is now working.\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5), initially not connected but later working.\n- Pipe Group connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and Steam Engine, with segments at positions (-5.5, 16.5) and (-8.5, 23.5), initially faced connection issues but later resolved and working.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles placed at positions (-0.5, 17.5) and (-0.5, 19.5).\n- Electricity Group at position (-5.4, 20.0), not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Currently has no ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors Between Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine\n- Ensure proper alignment and connection of pipes between the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine. Verify the path and placement of pipes to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Fuel Management for Boiler\n- Regularly check and supply fuel to the Boiler to maintain its operation. Ensure coal is available in the inventory before attempting to insert it into the Boiler.\n\n### Electric Network Connectivity\n- Verify that all electric poles are connected to the network and that the electricity group is properly plugged in to ensure power distribution.\n\n### Inventory Management for Crafting and Placement\n- Ensure that required items, such as Small Electric Poles, are available in the inventory before attempting to place them on the map."}
