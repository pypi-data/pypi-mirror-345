{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output still blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0), fueled with coal and working, though furnace source inventory is full and output inventory occasionally full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage and input/output buffers for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), both fueled and operational, moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with improved inserter fueling and chest management, though output belt blockage remains an issue.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), fueled with coal and working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), connected to boiler by a newly established pipe network, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Pipe groups connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine, with previous pipe blockages removed to enable fluid flow.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, with improved pipe connectivity ensuring fluid transfer.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), now connected to power network via a small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5), but still lacking iron plates input.\n- Input burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding into the assembly area.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational, placed after removing a blocking wooden chest.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), newly repositioned to receive assembling machine output.\n- Inserters and chests arranged to facilitate output flow, but assembling machine remains idle due to missing iron plate ingredients.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production, now powered and with improved inserter and chest layout, but requires iron plate input to operate.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous failures placing burner inserter next to assembling machine output chest were resolved by removing the blocking wooden chest.\n- Continue to verify tile occupancy before placing entities; removing or relocating blocking entities can enable successful placement.\n\n### Inserter inventory full or out of fuel issues\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are now fueled and operational.\n- Maintain regular fueling and monitor inserter inventories to prevent stoppages or insertion failures.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) remains unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plate ingredients.\n- Ensure sufficient iron plates are inserted into the assembling machine input chest at (21.5, 75.5) to meet recipe requirements.\n- Keep assembling machines connected to power network as done by placing electric pole at (25.5, 77.5).\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace source inventory is full at times, indicating output flow issues.\n- Output chests for assembling machine remain empty due to lack of input materials.\n- Maintain clear output belts and chests to ensure smooth item flow.\n- Confirm all machines remain connected to power network for operation.\n\n### Pipe connection errors and fluid flow blockages\n- Initial failure to connect boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) to steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to blocked pipe connection points.\n- Resolved by removing blocking pipes at positions (-6.5, 2.5), (-6.5, 3.5), (-6.5, 4.5), (-4.5, 6.5),"}
