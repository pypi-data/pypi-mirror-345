Verify that all entities have valid attributes before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in mining drills\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of mining drills and ensure they are adequately supplied with fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to output blockage in mining drills\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity (such as a chest or furnace) in place to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt by checking the input inventory and supplying the required materials.\n\n### Errors due to full fuel source in furnaces\n- Monitor the fuel levels in furnaces and avoid overfilling them to prevent wastage and inefficiency."}
