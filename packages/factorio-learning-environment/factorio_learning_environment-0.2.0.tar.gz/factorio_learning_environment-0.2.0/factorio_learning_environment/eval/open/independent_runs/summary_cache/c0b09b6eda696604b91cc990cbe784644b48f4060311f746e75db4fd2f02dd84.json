{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (1.5, -0.5), (3.5, -0.5), (-0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 2.5), and (3.5, 2.5) for feeding coal into the furnaces.\n\n### Belt Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt group with inputs at positions (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), and outputs at positions (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n- Another belt group with inputs at position (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) and outputs at position (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into inserters\n- Ensure you have sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel inserters. Harvest coal regularly to maintain a steady supply.\n\n### Furnace not working due to lack of ingredients\n- Verify that the stone furnaces have a continuous supply of iron ore to avoid interruptions in the smelting process. Regularly supply iron ore to the furnaces to keep them operational.\n\n### Assertion errors related to furnace status\n- Check the operational status of the furnaces regularly to ensure they are working as intended. Address any warnings or errors related to furnace operations promptly."}
