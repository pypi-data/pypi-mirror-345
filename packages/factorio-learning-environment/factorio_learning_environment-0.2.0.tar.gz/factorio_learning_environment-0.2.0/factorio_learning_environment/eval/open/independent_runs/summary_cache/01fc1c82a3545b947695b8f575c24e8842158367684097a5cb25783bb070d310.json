{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with warnings of \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\"\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) with warnings of \"not connected to power network\", \"no input liquid\", and \"no fluid present in connections\"\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status \"working\" and connected to a pipe at position (-9.5, 23.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 796, containing water, at position (-9.5, 23.5) with status \"full output\"\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 799, at position (-2.5, 22.5) with status \"empty\", consisting of pipes at positions (-2.5, 22.5), (-3.5, 22.5), (-0.5, 22.5), ..., (1.5, 22.5), (0.5, 22.5), (1.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) with warning \"not receiving electricity\", connected to a small electric pole at position (5.5, -60.5)\n\n### Storage and Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates and copper plates\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, status \"no research in progress\"\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (4.5, 21.5), (7.5, 20.5), (8.5, 21.5), ..., (1.5, -36.5), (28.5, -36.5), (7.5, -35.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected. Misalignment can prevent fluid flow and cause connection errors.\n\n### Boiler Connection Errors\n- Verify that the boiler is connected to the fluid network. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes that may prevent fluid from reaching the boiler.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the connection to nearby electric poles and ensure the power network is operational.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities, confirm that the intended position is not occupied by another entity to avoid placement errors."}
