{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Lab Facility at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (2.5, 0.5) connected to the electricity network\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) producing copper plates\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including the steam engine and lab\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are often required in larger quantities.\n\n### Incorrect Entity References\n- Verify that all entity names and types are correctly defined and available in your code. For instance, ensure that 'Lab' is correctly referenced and defined.\n\n### Connection Failures\n- Before attempting to connect entities like pipes and electric poles, ensure you have the required items in your inventory and that the entities are positioned correctly for connection.\n\n### Entity Not Found\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to interact with exist at the specified positions. This includes verifying the presence of labs or furnaces before performing operations on them.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Regularly check the status of your entities, such as steam engines, to ensure they are functioning as expected. If an assertion fails, investigate the underlying cause, such as lack of fuel or incorrect connections.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of fuel, such as coal, in your inventory to refuel boilers and other fuel-dependent entities."}
