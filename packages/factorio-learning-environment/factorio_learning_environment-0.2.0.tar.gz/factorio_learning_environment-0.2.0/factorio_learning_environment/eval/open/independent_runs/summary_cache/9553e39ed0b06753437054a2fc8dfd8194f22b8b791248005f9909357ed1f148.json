{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting these entities, including positions such as (x=21.5, y=-10.5) and (x=20.5, y=-5.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (x=24.5, y=-7.5), (x=24.5, y=-6.5), and (x=22.5, y=-4.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n- Inserter at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=5.5)\n- Transport Belt Network connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=9.5, y=5.5) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) to the assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the desired items. For example, the attempt to extract copper-cable at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) failed due to the absence of copper-cable in the entity.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. The inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) is waiting for source items, indicating that the source chest may be empty or not properly connected.\n\n### Errors with Assembling Machine Resource Shortage\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has all the necessary resources to produce the desired items. The assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) cannot create copper-cable due to missing copper-plate resources."}
