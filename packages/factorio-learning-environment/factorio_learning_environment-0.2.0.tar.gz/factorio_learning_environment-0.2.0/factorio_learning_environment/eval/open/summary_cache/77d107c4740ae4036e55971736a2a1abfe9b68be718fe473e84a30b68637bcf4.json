{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled by inserted coal  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled by inserted coal  \n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5) moving materials between mining drill, furnace, assembling machine, and chest, all fueled by inserted coal  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, but currently not powered  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels  \n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters, but power is not reaching the assembler  \n\nNo new structures have been added since the last report.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent assembler power issues  \n- Despite connecting electric poles to the assembling machine and inserters, the assembler remains without power (energy = 0.0).  \n- Verify that the electric poles are properly placed adjacent to or within connection range of the assembling machine and inserters.  \n- Confirm the electric poles themselves are connected to a powered network (e.g., connected to power generators or accumulators).  \n- Check for any missing power sources in the network or broken connections preventing power flow.  \n- Avoid assuming power connection by proximity; explicitly check entity power states after connection.  \n\n### Coal insertion errors due to inventory shortages  \n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into burner inserters failed due to \"No coal to insert from your inventory,\" despite recent harvesting.  \n- Ensure harvested coal is correctly added to the inventory before insertion attempts.  \n- Avoid attempting to insert more coal than currently held in inventory; track inventory counts accurately.  \n- Implement checks before insertion to confirm sufficient coal quantity is available.  \n\n### Entity placement failures due to missing inventory items  \n- Attempt to place offshore pump at water position failed because no offshore pump was available in inventory.  \n- Before placing entities, confirm the required entity type is present in inventory.  \n- Maintain inventory stock of critical infrastructure entities (offshore pumps, solar panels) to avoid placement failures.  \n\n### Power provisioning limitations  \n- No solar panels available in inventory to provide power, limiting ability to power electric entities.  \n- Plan for early acquisition or crafting of power generation entities to ensure continuous power supply.  \n\n### General placement and connection tips (from previous report)  \n- Confirm target tiles are free before placing entities to avoid collisions.  \n- Use inserters to extract items from furnaces before feeding onto belts; direct belt connections from furnaces are invalid.  \n- Adjust spacing and placement directions to avoid entity collisions.  \n- Regularly verify power network connectivity and energy levels to prevent production halts.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
