{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace**: Position (-13.0, -50.0)\n  - Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Current status: `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS` (no ingredients to smelt).\n  - Inventory: Contains 1 iron plate and 19 coal.\n\n#### Wooden Chest at position (-10.5, -49.5)\n- **Wooden Chest**: Position (-10.5, -49.5)\n  - Used for storing iron plates.\n  - Current status: `EntityStatus.NORMAL`.\n  - Inventory: Empty.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when crafting items without required raw resources\n- Ensure you have gathered the necessary raw resources (e.g., wood) before attempting to craft items like wooden chests. Wood is a raw resource and must be harvested, not crafted.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items requiring sub-ingredients\n- Verify that all sub-ingredients (e.g., iron plates for inserters) are available or can be crafted before attempting to craft the final item. Iron plates require smelting in a furnace.\n\n#### Errors due to smelting timeout\n- Ensure the furnace has sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) and input materials (e.g., iron ore) to complete the smelting process. Monitor the furnace's status to avoid timeouts.\n\n#### Repeated extraction attempts without verifying furnace output\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to extract items from a furnace without first confirming the presence of the desired output. Check the furnace's inventory and status before extraction.\n\n#### Errors when furnace has no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure the furnace is supplied with both fuel and input materials (e.g., coal and iron ore) to avoid the `NO_INGREDIENTS` status.\n\n#### Errors when placing or removing chests without proper inventory checks\n- Ensure that chests are placed and removed only when necessary and that their inventory is checked before removal to avoid losing items.\n\n#### Errors when crafting inserters without iron plates\n- Always ensure that iron plates are available in the inventory or can be produced in the furnace before attempting to craft inserters.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a furnace that does not contain the expected output\n- Verify the furnace's inventory and status before attempting to extract items. Ensure the furnace has completed smelting and contains the desired output (e.g., iron plates)."}
