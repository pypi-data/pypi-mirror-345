{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is generating power, while the boiler is converting coal into steam for the engine. The offshore pump is supplying water to the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items from inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. In this case, the agent attempted to insert coal into the boiler but had no coal in inventory.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
