{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (2.0, -63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (2.0, -63.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (4.0, -63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates. Currently out of fuel and has a full furnace source inventory.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (6.0, -63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (3.5, -61.5): Transfers items between the mining drill, chests, and furnaces. Currently has a full destination chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (2.5, -61.5): Stores iron ore from the mining drill. Contains 103 iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (4.5, -61.5): Stores iron ore from the mining drill. Contains 800 iron ore and is full.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items\n- **Missing source argument**: Ensure the `source` argument is provided when calling `extract_item`. For example, `extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, source=Position(x, y), quantity=100)`.\n- **Invalid source position**: Verify that the source position contains the desired item. For example, ensure iron ore exists at the specified position before attempting extraction.\n- **Extracting from empty or invalid entities**: Check that the entity (e.g., furnace or chest) contains the item you are trying to extract. For example, do not attempt to extract iron plates from a furnace that has no iron plates.\n\n#### Errors when inventory is full\n- **Inventory full during extraction**: Ensure your inventory has space before attempting to extract items. For example, clear some inventory space before extracting iron ore.\n- **Chest full during item transfer**: Empty the destination chest before transferring items. For example, clear the wooden chest at Position (4.5, -61.5) to allow the burner inserter to continue transferring iron ore.\n\n#### Errors when placing or interacting with entities\n- **Out of fuel**: Ensure entities like burner mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) to operate. For example, refuel the burner mining drill at Position (2.0, -63.0) and the stone furnace at Position (4.0, -63.0).\n- **No ingredients to smelt**: Ensure furnaces have the required ingredients (e.g., iron ore) before attempting to smelt. For example, provide iron ore to the stone furnace at Position (6.0, -63.0).\n- **Chest is full**: Ensure destination chests have space before transferring items. For example, empty the wooden chest at Position (4.5, -61.5) to allow the burner inserter to continue transferring iron ore."}
