{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) for mining iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) for transferring mined iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) for moving iron plates from the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -45.5) for transferring items between chests.\n\n### Secondary Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (-10.0, -48.0) for additional smelting of iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) for moving iron plates from the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Undefined Entities\n- Ensure all entities, such as chests, are properly defined and exist at the specified positions before attempting to interact with them.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters have a source item available to pick up. Ensure the supply chain is not interrupted and source items are being fed into the inserters.\n\n### Inventory Full Errors\n- Regularly clear out furnaces and chests to prevent inventory overflow. Ensure that there is enough space in the destination inventory before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Unbound Local Variable Errors\n- Check that all local variables are properly initialized and associated with a value before use in any function or operation.\n\n### No Iron Ore Available for Transfer\n- Maintain a consistent supply of iron ore in chests to avoid interruptions in production. Ensure that mining drills are operational and adequately fueled."}
