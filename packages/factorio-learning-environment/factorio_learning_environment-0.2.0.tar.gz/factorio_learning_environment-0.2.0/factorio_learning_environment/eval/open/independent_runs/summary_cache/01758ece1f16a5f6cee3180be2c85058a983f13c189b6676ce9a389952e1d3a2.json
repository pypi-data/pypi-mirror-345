{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5). This drill is currently out of fuel and has a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) with a pickup position at (x=-14.5, y=-51.5) and a drop position at (x=-12.5, y=-51.5). This inserter is waiting for source items.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to position (x=-12.5, y=-51.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a furnace result inventory containing iron plates. The furnace is currently out of ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) with a pickup position at (x=0.5, y=-2.5) and a drop position at (x=0.5, y=-0.5). This inserter is waiting for source items.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) to position (x=0.5, y=-2.5).\n\n### Belt Group\n- A belt group with inputs from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) and outputs from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), consisting of 75 belts.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Ensure that all mining drills and inserters are adequately refueled to prevent interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Verify that the inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to insert them into entities. In this case, ensure coal is available in the inventory before attempting to insert it into a drill.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full output chests.\n\n### Errors with belt and inserter blockages\n- Regularly inspect belts and inserters for blockages and ensure that they are functioning correctly to maintain a smooth flow of resources.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure that the item is available in the inventory before invoking this function.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `drill`: Represents the mining drill entity, which requires regular refueling and maintenance.\n  - `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory of the agent, including items like wood, stone, iron ore, and iron plates."}
