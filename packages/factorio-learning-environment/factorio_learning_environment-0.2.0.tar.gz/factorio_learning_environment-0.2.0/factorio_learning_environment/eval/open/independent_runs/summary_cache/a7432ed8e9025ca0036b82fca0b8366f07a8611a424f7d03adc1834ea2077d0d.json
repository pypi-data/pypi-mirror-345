{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Automation at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace positioned at (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting operations; current state now shows a fuel reserve of {'coal': 15}, energy level 1600.0, and its output inventory updated to furnace_result={'iron-plate': 1} with a warning status indicating no ingredients are available for smelting.\n- Wooden Chest positioned at (-13.5, -49.5) serving as storage.\n- Burner Inserter positioned at (-12.5, -49.5) responsible for transferring items between the furnace and the chest; rotated to face DOWN with a pickup position of (-12.5, -50.5) and a drop position of (-12.5, -48.5), carrying a fuel reserve of {'coal': 4}.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Placement Conflicts Due to Insufficient Spacing\n- Verify target positions for placement are unoccupied; when placement fails due to adjacent entities, adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position accordingly.\n\n### Stale Entity Data Management\n- Confirm entity data synchronization after operations. Occurrences of stale data require validation commands or refresh requests to retrieve current entity states.\n\n### Inconsistent Extraction Operation Practices\n- Ensure proximity to the target entity and verify that the targeted inventory holds the desired items before executing extraction procedures.\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Insertion Arguments and Inventory Checks\n- Always verify that the target entity is correctly passed as an argument when inserting items, and confirm sufficient inventory is available prior to insertion.\n\n### Insufficient Production Output Verification\n- Allow adequate time for processes such as smelting to update outputs before performing inventory or state checks.\n\n### Resource Retrieval and Placement Timing Issues\n- Confirm target locations are accessible and correct before initiating resource transfers, ensuring the sequence of extraction and insertion actions is maintained.\n\n### Fuel Handling and Inventory Availability Errors\n- Verify that the respective inventory holds the required fuel items before refueling operations to avoid enactment failures."}
