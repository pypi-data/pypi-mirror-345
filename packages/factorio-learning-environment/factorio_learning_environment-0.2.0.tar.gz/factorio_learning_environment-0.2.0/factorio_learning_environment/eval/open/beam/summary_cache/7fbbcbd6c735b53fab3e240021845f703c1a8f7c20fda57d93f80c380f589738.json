{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to insert the Copper Ore into the active furnace has failed once again due to the furnace still containing stone, which prevents further insertions:\n\n### Active Furnace Status:\n- The furnace currently contains **5 pieces of stone**, which is blocking the addition of Copper Ore.\n- The error message returned is:\n  - **\"Cannot insert copper-ore - furnace already contains stone.\"**\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - **1 piece of stone-brick** in inventory.\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the new one)\n  - **13 pieces of coal** available.\n  - **5 pieces of stone** currently in the furnace.\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is still holding the stone, which is preventing the Copper Ore from being inserted.\n- I need to extract the stone from the furnace before I can proceed with loading the Copper Ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract the Stone from the Furnace**: I will extract the **5 pieces of stone** currently blocking the furnace.\n2. **Reinsert Required Materials**: After extracting the stone, I will attempt to load **5 pieces of stone** and **1 piece of Copper Ore** back into the furnace.\n3. **Check Processing Activation**: Finally, I will verify if the furnace begins processing after loading the inputs.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the stone from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Attempt to extract the 5 pieces of stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, new_active_furnace, quantity=5)  # Attempting to extract all pieces of stone\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nnew_active_furnace_status_after_stone_extraction = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_stone_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"New Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {new_active_furnace_status_after_stone_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_stone_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-448]"}
