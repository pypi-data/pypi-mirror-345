{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a new report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around position x=41-46, y=-80 to -82)\nComplex structure consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- First burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing right\n- Second burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) moving items from belt\nThe system is partially working but has some alignment and blockage issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing furnaces, ensure the target location is completely clear and not overlapping with water or other entities\n- Check if the target position is valid before attempting to place structures\n- Use precise coordinates that align with the game's grid system\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor inserter fuel inventories to prevent overfilling (50/50 limit observed)\n- Clear blocked resources from belts and drop positions before attempting new operations\n- Handle \"chest is full\" conditions by ensuring proper item flow or adding more storage\n\n### Entity Alignment Issues\n- Ensure furnaces are properly aligned with inserter drop positions\n- When repositioning structures, verify the new position is compatible with existing infrastructure\n- Consider the direction and orientation of inserters relative to their input/output positions\n\n### Belt Management\n- Clear blocked items from belts before attempting to place new structures\n- Ensure proper item flow by managing belt blockages\n- Verify belt connections between components are properly aligned\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n- insert_item(prototype, target, quantity): Inserts items into entities\n- rotate_entity(): Changes entity facing direction\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- furnace: StoneFurnace\n- belt: TransportBelt"}
