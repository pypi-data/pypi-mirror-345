{"content": "I now understand the key issues from these attempts:\n\n1. Analysis of Problems:\n- We cannot craft iron chests because we need a specific crafting/smelting machine\n- We only have 1 iron plate, which isn't enough anyway\n- Direct crafting isn't possible without the proper machinery\n\n2. Available Resources:\n- 39 transport belts\n- 28 coal\n- 1 iron plate\n- Multiple furnaces and drills on the map\n\n3. Better Strategy:\nLet's focus on getting the existing machinery working first:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Get all mining drills that need fuel\ndrills = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})\nprint(f\"Found {len(drills)} mining drills\")\n\n# Fuel all drills that need it\nfor drill in drills:\n    if drill.status == EntityStatus.NO_FUEL:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=4)\n        print(f\"Added fuel to drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n# Look for existing chests we can use\nexisting_chests = get_entities({Prototype.IronChest})\nprint(f\"Found {len(existing_chests)} existing iron chests\")\n\n# Print status of all machines\nprint(\"\\nMachine Status:\")\nprint(f\"Drills: {[(d.position, d.status) for d in drills]}\")\nprint(f\"Chests: {[(c.position, inspect_inventory(c)) for c in existing_chests]}\")\n```\n\nThis approach should:\n1. Work with existing infrastructure rather than trying to craft new items\n2. Get the mining operation working by fueling drills\n3. Use existing storage solutions\n4.
