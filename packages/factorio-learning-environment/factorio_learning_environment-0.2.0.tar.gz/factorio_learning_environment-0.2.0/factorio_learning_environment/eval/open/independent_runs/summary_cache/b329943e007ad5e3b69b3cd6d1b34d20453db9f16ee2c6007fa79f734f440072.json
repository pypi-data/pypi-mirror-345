{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 25.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 25.0) with status NO_FUEL, connected to pipes.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-0.5, 25.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED, connected to pipes and small electric poles.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status WORKING, connected to pipes.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (15.0, 0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, producing iron plates.\n- **Inserters** at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5), connected to power network, with status NO_POWER.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- **PipeGroup** connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler, with status FULL_OUTPUT, transporting water.\n- **PipeGroup** at position (-1.5, 17.5) with status EMPTY.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles at various positions, providing power to connected entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, make sure you have coal before inserting it into the boiler.\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Pipes\n- Verify that you have sufficient pipes in your inventory before attempting to reconnect them. Ensure that the connection path is clear and that the pipes are correctly aligned.\n\n### Inserter and Chest Alignment Issues\n- Align inserters properly to ensure they can pick up and drop items correctly. Check that chests are properly aligned with inserters to avoid empty or misaligned source/destination errors.\n\n### Power Network Connection Errors\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the electricity network and that the network is operational to avoid NO_POWER status.\n\nBy addressing these errors, you can improve the efficiency and functionality of your structures in the game."}
