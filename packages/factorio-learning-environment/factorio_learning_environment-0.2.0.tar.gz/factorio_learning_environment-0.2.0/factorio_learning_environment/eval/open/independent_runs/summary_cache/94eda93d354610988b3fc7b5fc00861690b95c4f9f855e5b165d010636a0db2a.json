{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (7.5, 5.5) connected to a power network\n- Wooden Chest at Position (8.5, 5.5) to store extracted items\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) storing iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) and another at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Coal-Fueled Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) with a full output status\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (20.5, -10.5) transporting steam\n- PipeGroup at Position (4.5, -9.5) transporting water\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -2.5) transporting water\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (10.5, 2.5) and (24.5, -7.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the connection points between entities like pipes and offshore pumps or boilers are correctly aligned and within reach. Misalignment or incorrect positioning can lead to connection failures.\n\n### Errors with Assembling Machines\n- Ensure that all required resources are available for the assembling machine to function. The assembling machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) is missing copper plates, which are necessary for producing copper cables.\n\n### Inserter Errors\n- Make sure that inserters have access to source items. The inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential supply chain issue.\n\n### Furnace Warnings\n- Check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnaces at Positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0) are lacking ingredients, which prevents them from functioning efficiently."}
