{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup for water transport, starting at position (x=-3.5, y=26.5)\n- PipeGroup for steam transport, starting at position (x=1.5, y=26.5)\n- ElectricityGroup connecting the lab at position (x=5.5, y=5.5) to the power source with multiple poles, including positions such as (x=7.5, y=9.5), (x=13.5, y=27.5), and (x=12.5, y=34.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) with pickup position (x=53.5, y=-83.5) and drop position (x=55.5, y=-83.5).\n- Iron Chests at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n- BeltGroup transporting coal, including belts at positions such as (x=50.5, y=-86.5) and (x=43.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Copper Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) with pickup position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) and drop position (x=41.5, y=-81.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between the boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0) and the steam engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5) are correctly established. Verify that there are no missing or misplaced pipes in the connection path.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty the wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that the power network is complete and all entities requiring power are connected to the electricity grid. Verify that the lab at position (x=5.5, y=5.5) is receiving power from the electricity generator."}
