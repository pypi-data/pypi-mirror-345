{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0) with status NO_FUEL and warnings ['out of fuel']\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED and warnings ['not connected to power network', 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections']\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler with water, status FULL_OUTPUT\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine with steam, status EMPTY\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS and warnings ['no ingredients to smelt']\n\n### Lab at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with status NO_POWER\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with Boiler Dimensions\n- Ensure that the correct attributes are being accessed for boiler dimensions. The attribute `tile_dimensions` does not exist on `Prototype.Boiler.entity_class`.\n\n### Type Errors with Boiler Width and Height\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that the operands are of compatible types. Convert `ModelPrivateAttr` to a compatible type before performing operations.\n\n### Connection Errors Due to Missing Items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, pipes are needed to connect the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Items in Inventory\n- Keep track of your inventory to ensure you have enough materials to craft necessary items like small electric poles and to refuel entities like the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Lab Status\n- Ensure that the lab is correctly placed and connected to a power source. Verify the existence of the lab at the specified position before attempting to check its status."}
