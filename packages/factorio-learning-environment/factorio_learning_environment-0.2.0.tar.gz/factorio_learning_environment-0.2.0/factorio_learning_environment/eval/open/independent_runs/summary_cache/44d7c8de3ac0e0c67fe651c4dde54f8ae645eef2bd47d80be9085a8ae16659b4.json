Clear nearby entities to eliminate collisions that prevent successful pipe connections.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Verification for Entity Placement:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required item exists in inventory prior to placement. An attempt to place an entity (such as a steam engine) without inventory availability will lead to placement failure.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Sub-Ingredient Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all necessary intermediate components (for example, sufficient iron-plates to produce iron-gear-wheels) are available before initiating a craft. If shortfalls occur, extract outputs from furnaces to bolster component inventories.\n\n\u2022 Furnace Operation and Fuel Insertion:\n\u2003\u2013 Before inserting fuel (or an alternative fuel) into a furnace, clear its output inventory to avoid insertion errors due to full capacity. Monitor both fuel levels and furnace output status to maintain smooth smelting operations.\n\n\u2022 Consistent API Usage:\n\u2003\u2013 Utilize standardized, lowercase prototype names and correctly access entity position attributes when repositioning or placing entities. This helps avoid reference errors or type mismatches during API calls."}
