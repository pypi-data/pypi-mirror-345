{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting various positions from (-9.5, 23.5) to (1.5, 24.5)\n- **Small Electric Poles** at positions (0.5, 21.5), (-0.5, 26.5), (-1.5, 26.5), (0.5, 26.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- **Furnace** with fuel inventory of coal and warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Lab\n- **Lab** with input of automation science packs and currently researching electronics.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a boiler without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Operation\n- Make sure to provide the necessary ingredients for smelting in the furnace to avoid warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\nThese tips should help in mitigating the errors encountered and improve the efficiency of operations in the game."}
