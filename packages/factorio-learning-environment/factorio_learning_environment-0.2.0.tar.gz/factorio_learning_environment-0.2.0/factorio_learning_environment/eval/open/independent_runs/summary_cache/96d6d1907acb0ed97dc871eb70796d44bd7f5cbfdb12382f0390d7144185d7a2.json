{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with 794 units of coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, working status, connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) fueled by coal, working status, transferring coal between:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5)\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) with 288 units of coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled by coal, with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt', containing 5 iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) with 5 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) with 5 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) with 5 units of coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) fueled by coal, with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt', containing 5 iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnaces at positions (61.0, -54.0) and (64.0, -53.0) are currently not operational due to the lack of ingredients.\n\n### Efficient Resource Transfer\n- When transferring resources between chests or other entities, ensure that the receiving entity has enough space to accommodate the transferred resources.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Current inventory of the agent.\n  - `entities`: List[Entity] - List of entities on the map with their positions and statuses."}
