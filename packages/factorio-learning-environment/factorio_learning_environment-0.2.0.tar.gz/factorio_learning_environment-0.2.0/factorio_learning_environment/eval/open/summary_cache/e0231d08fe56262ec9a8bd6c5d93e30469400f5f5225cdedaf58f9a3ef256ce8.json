{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup near positions (15.5, 73.5) to (18.5, 75.5)\nConsists of the following interconnected entities forming a basic iron plate production line:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (16.0, 71.0) for extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (16.5, 72.5) to collect iron ore from the mining drill\n- Wooden Chest at position (15.5, 73.5) to receive iron ore from inserter feeding the furnace\n- Stone Furnace at position (18.0, 73.0) to smelt iron ore into iron plates\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 73.5) to feed iron ore from chest into the furnace\n- Inserter at position (18.5, 74.5) to extract iron plates from the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 75.5) to collect iron plates from the inserter\n- Burner Inserters at positions (16.5, 73.5) and (18.5, 74.5) fueled with coal to operate the ore feeding and plate extraction\n- Small Electric Poles distributed nearby (positions around 17.5, 71.5 and 19.5, 73.5) for power distribution, although some connection attempts failed\n\nThis structure enables extraction of iron ore, smelting into iron plates, and collection of output plates in chests for further use.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Direction argument type error when placing entities\n- When placing entities that require a direction parameter, ensure the direction argument is passed as a Direction enum object rather than a raw value or integer. This avoids ValueError exceptions.\n\n### Connection failures between entities for electric poles\n- When connecting entities with electric poles, verify that the entities and their fields exist and are correctly referenced to avoid nil value indexing errors.\n- Confirm that the connection function handles entity types and positions properly.\n\n### Extraction from empty or incorrect chests\n- Attempting to extract items from chests that do not contain the requested items results in exceptions. Always check inventory contents before extraction.\n\n### Placement too far from player position\n- Entities cannot be placed beyond a certain maximum distance (approx. 10 units) from the player\u2019s current position.\n- Move the player closer to the target position before attempting to place entities to avoid placement errors.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent so far."}
