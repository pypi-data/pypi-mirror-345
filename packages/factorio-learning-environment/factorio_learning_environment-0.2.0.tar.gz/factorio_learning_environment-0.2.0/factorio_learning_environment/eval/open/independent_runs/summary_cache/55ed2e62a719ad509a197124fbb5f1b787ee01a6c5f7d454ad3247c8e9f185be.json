{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Crude Oil Extraction and Electricity Generation Structure at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pumpjack (position: 17.5, 40.5)\n- Boiler (position: 22.5, 41.0)\n- Steam Engine (position: 27.5, 40.5)\n- Offshore Pump (position: -9.5, -0.5)\n- Storage Tank (position: 17.5, 45.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, pumpjack to the storage tank, and boiler to the steam engine\n  - Specifically, the pipe network includes:\n    - Pipe connections from offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) to boiler at (22.5, 41.0)\n    - Pipe connections from pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) to storage tank at (17.5, 45.5)\n    - Pipe connections from boiler at (22.5, 41.0) to steam engine at (27.5, 40.5)\n- Electricity network connecting the steam engine to the pumpjack and other entities\n  - Specifically, the electricity network includes:\n    - Small electric poles at positions (19.5, 41.5), (29.5, 41.5), (28.5, 44.5), (21.5, 43.5), and (24.5, 44.5), (25.5, 41.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when using undefined variables:\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before using them. Check the code for any typos or missing assignments.\n* Errors when placing entities too far away from the player's position:\n  - Ensure the player is close enough to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n* Errors when not having enough resources or incorrect setup for entity placement:\n  - Verify that the required resources are available in the inventory and that the entity is being placed according to the game's rules and the entity's requirements.\n* Errors when entities are not receiving electricity:\n  - Ensure that the entities are connected to a power source and that the power network is properly configured. Check that the steam engine is producing electricity and that the electric poles are correctly placed to distribute the power.\n* Errors when entities have no input liquid or no fluid present in connections:\n  - Verify that the fluid networks are properly connected and that the required fluids are being supplied. Check that the offshore pump is pumping water and that the pumpjack is extracting crude oil.\n* Errors when attempting to insert items into an entity without having the required items in the inventory:\n  - Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n* Errors due to typos in code:\n  - Check the code for any typos or syntax errors. In step 105, the error 'NameError: name 'r' is not defined' occurred due to a typo.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given execution logs.
