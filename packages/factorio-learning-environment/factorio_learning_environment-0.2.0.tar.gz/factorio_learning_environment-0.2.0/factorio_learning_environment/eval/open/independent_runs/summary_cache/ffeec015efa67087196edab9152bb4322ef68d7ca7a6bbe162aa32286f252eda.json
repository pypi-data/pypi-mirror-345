{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with fuel (coal: 16), working status, and warnings about a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, y=-60.5), (4.5, y=-58.5) with iron ore inventory and warnings about being full.\n- **Iron Chests** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel, no ingredients to smelt warnings, and iron plates in the result inventory.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), (-12.5, y=-50.5), (-11.5, y=-50.5) with warnings about being full and storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources or processed goods have enough capacity. Regularly empty or upgrade chests to prevent mining or production stoppages due to full inventory warnings.\n\n### Errors Related to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials to process. Regularly check and refill the input inventory of furnaces to prevent production halts due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined or invoked in the logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal: int` - Current amount of coal in inventory: 495.\n- `iron_ore: int` - Current amount of iron ore in inventory: 142.\n- `iron_plate: int` - Current amount of iron plates in inventory: 5198.\n- `iron_gear_wheel: int` - Current amount of iron gear wheels in inventory: 4."}
