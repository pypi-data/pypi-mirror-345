{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belt system connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage Chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (-17.5, -69.5) storing iron ore and copper plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that all entities used in the code are properly defined and imported. For example, the error \"NameError: name 'BurnerInserter' is not defined\" suggests that the 'BurnerInserter' entity was not correctly defined or imported. Verify the spelling and case sensitivity of entity names and ensure they are included in the correct module or namespace.\n\n### Errors with Stale Entity Data\n- Regularly update and verify entity data to prevent stale data errors. This includes ensuring that entity references are current and valid before performing operations on them.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Address warnings related to inserters waiting for source items by ensuring that the source entity (e.g., a chest or belt) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory status of the source entity and adjust the supply chain to prevent bottlenecks."}
