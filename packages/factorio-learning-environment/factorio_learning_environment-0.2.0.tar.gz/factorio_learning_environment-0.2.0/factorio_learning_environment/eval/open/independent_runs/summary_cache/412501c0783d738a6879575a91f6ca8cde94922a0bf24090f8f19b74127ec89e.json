{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This is responsible for extracting iron ore from the resource patch. It is currently fueled with coal and operational, but has a warning that the chest at its drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest is used to store extracted iron ore from the mining drill. It is currently empty or low on iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is intended to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is currently out of fuel but operational.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): This furnace is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is currently fueled with coal but has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inserter Fueling\n- Ensure that the inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) is consistently refueled with coal to maintain continuous operation. Monitor coal inventory levels to prevent the inserter from running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors Related to Chest Capacity\n- Regularly check and empty the wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining operation of the burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Verify the alignment and positioning of the inserter to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment can cause the furnace to not receive the necessary iron ore for smelting.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Maintain adequate coal reserves in the inventory to ensure all fuel-dependent entities, such as the burner mining drill and inserter, remain operational. Consider harvesting additional coal resources as needed."}
