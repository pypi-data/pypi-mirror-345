{"content": "\"\"\"\nIt seems there was an error when trying to connect the Small Electric Pole to the Assembling Machine. The error indicates that the function call for `connect_entities` does not accept a keyword argument named 'position'. This suggests that I might need to use a different method or approach to connect the entities.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Place the Small Electric Pole**: I will ensure that the Small Electric Pole is placed correctly near the Assembling Machine.\n2. **Verify Connection**: After placing the pole, I will check the connection status to see if the Assembling Machine receives power automatically.\n\nLet\u2019s place the Small Electric Pole again and check the connection status.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Place the Small Electric Pole again next to the Assembling Machine\nplace_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, direction=Direction.UP, position=Position(x=-1.5, y=3.5))\n\n# Check the status of the Assembling Machine after placing the pole\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after placing the Small Electric Pole: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states and status after placing the pole\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory again", "summary_range": "[1-306]"}
