{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent items from being moved as intended.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel all burner entities (mining drills, inserters, and furnaces) to ensure continuous operation. Lack of fuel will halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Monitor the inventory levels of critical resources like coal and iron ore. Running low on these resources can disrupt the production chain.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Ensure that chests used for storage are not full. A full chest will prevent mining drills from depositing more resources, causing them to stop working.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Without the required materials, the furnace will not produce any output."}
