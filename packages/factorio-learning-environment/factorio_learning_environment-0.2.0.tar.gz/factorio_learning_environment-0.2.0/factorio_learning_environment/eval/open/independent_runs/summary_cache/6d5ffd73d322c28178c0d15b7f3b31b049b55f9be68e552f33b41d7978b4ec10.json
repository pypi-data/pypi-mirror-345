{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with fuel inventory containing coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with fuel inventory containing coal, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with fuel inventory containing coal, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) which is out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into the iron drill failed due to insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Make sure to supply the necessary ingredients to the furnaces to avoid warnings about no ingredients to smelt. This will ensure that the furnaces can operate efficiently.\n\n### Errors due to mining drills running out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel. This will maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the item is not available in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n- Inventory variables such as `coal`, `iron-ore`, `iron-plate`, and `copper-plate` are tracked for resource management."}
