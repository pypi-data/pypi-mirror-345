{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0), currently out of fuel and containing 10 iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5), waiting for source items, with its pickup position at (-11.5, -48.5) and drop position at (-9.5, -48.5).\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of the following BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) and outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5) and outputs from (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) and outputs from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-52.5) and outputs from (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Path Creation\n- Ensure that the transport belt path is valid and can be normalized before attempting to connect belts from position (x=-19.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Issues\n- Investigate the furnace setup to ensure it is properly fueled and connected to a source of iron ore to produce iron plates.\n\n### Placement Errors for Wooden Chest\n- Verify that there is a suitable and unoccupied position for placing the wooden chest before attempting to place it."}
