{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=52.5, y=-80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=53.5, y=-80.5) for storing mined coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (x=53.5, y=-80.5) to another chest at (x=52.5, y=-78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-78.5) storing transferred coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-76.5) for further coal transfer operations.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) storing mined iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest at (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-48.5) for additional transfer operations.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest at (x=-13.5, y=-45.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the error at step 560 occurred because there was no coal in the inventory to insert into the coal drill.\n\n### Warnings related to full chests and lack of ingredients\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process, as indicated by the warning \"no ingredients to smelt\" for the stone furnace.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal_drill`: Used in step 560 for inserting coal into the drill.\n- Inventory variables: \n  - `{'wooden-chest': 3, 'wood': 10, 'iron-ore': 650, 'iron-plate': 865}` indicating the current state of the agent's inventory."}
