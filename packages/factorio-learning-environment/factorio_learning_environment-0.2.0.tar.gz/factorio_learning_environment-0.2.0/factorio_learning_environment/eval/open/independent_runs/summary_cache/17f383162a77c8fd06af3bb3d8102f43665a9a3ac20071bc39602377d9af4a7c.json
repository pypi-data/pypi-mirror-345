{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5) with status WORKING\n- Pipe Group connecting various positions, including (x=19.5, y=-2.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, and (x=20.5, y=-8.5) with status EMPTY\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=24.5, y=-7.5) not plugged into the electric network\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, producing copper plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, producing copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, producing iron plates\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) with status NO_POWER\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5) with status NORMAL\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=-2.5, y=1.5) not receiving electricity\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement and Connection\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before attempting to place a pipe. Verify that the tile is free from other entities.\n- When attempting to pick up pipes, confirm the exact position of the pipe to avoid errors related to non-existent pipes.\n\n### Errors with Water Supply to Boiler\n- Verify that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. Ensure that the fluid box of the boiler contains water to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network Connection\n- Ensure that all electric poles are properly connected to the electric network. Verify that the steam engine is receiving electricity and that all components are plugged into the network.\n\n### General Entity Connection Errors\n- Regularly inspect connections between entities to ensure they are functioning as intended. Check for any warnings or errors in the status of each entity to address connectivity issues promptly."}
