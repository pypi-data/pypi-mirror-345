Avoid using non-numeric types like 'ModelPrivateAttr'.\n\n### Errors with Attribute Access\n- Verify that the attributes you are trying to access, like `tile_dimensions`, exist in the object. Ensure the object is correctly instantiated and the attribute is available.\n\n### Errors with Unsupported Operand Types\n- When performing operations like addition, ensure both operands are of compatible types. Avoid mixing incompatible types such as 'ModelPrivateAttr' and 'int'.\n\n### Errors with Missing Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to connect entities like pipes, ensure you have the required items in your inventory to complete the connection."}
