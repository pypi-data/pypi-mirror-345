{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. The agent attempted multiple times to establish a power network by placing electric poles and connecting them to the steam engine. These attempts involved deleting existing poles, placing new ones, and connecting them. The boiler was refueled multiple times. Currently, the boiler is fueled and producing steam, and the steam engine has steam, but it is not connected to any power network.\n*   Offshore Pump at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - Status: WORKING\n*   Pipes connecting the pump to the boiler (PipeGroup starting at x=-8.5, y=-0.5) - Status: WORKING (water)\n*   Boiler at (x=-5.0, y=2.5) - Status: WORKING (fueled with coal)\n*   Pipes connecting the boiler to the steam engine (PipeGroup starting at x=-6.5, y=3.5) - Status: WORKING (steam)\n*   Steam Engine (Generator) at (x=0.5, y=6.5) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK (has steam, but no power connection)\n*   Small Electric Poles: Attempts were made to place poles at (x=0.5, y=4.5), (x=4.5, y=4.5), and (x=2.0, y=6.5), but these were either deleted or failed placement. Currently, there are no poles connected to the steam engine.\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Assembly Area at Position (x=23.5, y=12.5) to (x=26.5, y=19.5)\nThis area contains the components for assembling iron gear wheels from iron plates. These components remain unpowered and lack input materials as the power generation setup is not yet complete.\n*   Inserter at (x=23.5, y=12.5) - Status: NO_POWER\n*   Inserter at (x=26.5, y=12.5) - Status: NO_POWER\n*   Assembling Machine 2 at (x=24.5, y=16.5) - Recipe: iron-gear-wheel, Status: NO_POWER\n*   Inserter at (x=24.5, y=14.5) - Status: NO_POWER\n*   Inserter at (x=24.5, y=18.5) - Status: NO_POWER\n*   Wooden Chest at (x=24.5, y=19.5) - Status: NORMAL\n*   BeltGroup connecting inserters - Status: EMPTY\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting (Partial) near (x=15.5,"}
