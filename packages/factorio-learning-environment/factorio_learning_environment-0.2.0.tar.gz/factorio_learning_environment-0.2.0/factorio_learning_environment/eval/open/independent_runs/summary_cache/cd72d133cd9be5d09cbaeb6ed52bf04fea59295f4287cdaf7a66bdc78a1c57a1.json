{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mining Operation at position(x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of a burner-mining-drill (position x=41, y=-82) with a fuel source of coal, and two chests (positions x=40.5, y=-83.5 and x=41.5, y=-83.5) to store the mined coal. The burner-mining-drill is connected to the chests and is currently working.\n\n### Coal Transportation System at position(x=39.5, y=-81.5)\nConsists of a burner-inserter (position x=39.5, y=-81.5) that is waiting for source items to transport coal from the mining operation to other parts of the factory.\n\n### Furnace at position(x=0, y=0)\nConsists of a stone-furnace (position x=0, y=0) with a fuel source of coal, but it currently has no ingredients to smelt and its fuel source is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the inventory of the entity is not full before attempting to insert items.\n- Check the warnings for the entity to see if the inventory is full or if there are any other issues.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a chest\n- Ensure that the chest is not empty before attempting to extract items.\n- Check the warnings for the entity to see if there are any issues with the extraction process.\n\n### Errors when mining with a full chest at the drop position\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before attempting to mine.\n- Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  + `coal_chest`: a chest entity used to store coal\n  + `drill`: a burner-mining-drill entity used to mine coal\n  + `inserter`: a burner-inserter entity used to transport coal\n  + `furnace`: a stone-furnace entity used to smelt coal\n* Utility functions:\n  + `insert_item`: a function used to insert items into an entity's inventory\n  + `extract_item`: a function used to extract items from an entity's inventory\n  + `get_entity_status`: a function used to get the status of an entity\n  + `get_entity_warnings`: a function used to get the warnings for an entity"}
