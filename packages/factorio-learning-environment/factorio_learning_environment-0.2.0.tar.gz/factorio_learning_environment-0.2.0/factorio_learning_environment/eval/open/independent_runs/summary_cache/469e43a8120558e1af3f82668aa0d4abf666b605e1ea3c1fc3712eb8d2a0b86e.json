{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-86.0): Extracts coal from a resource patch.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (x=41.5, y=-84.5): Transports coal from the mining drill to the burner inserter.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5): Transfers coal from the transport belt to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-82.5): Stores coal transported by the burner inserter.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at Position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients for smelting.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Refueling Burner Entities\n- Ensure burner entities like the burner mining drill and burner inserter are refueled regularly to maintain operation. The agent has successfully refueled these entities multiple times, which is good practice.\n\n#### Idle Furnace Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- The stone furnace at (x=-13.0, y=-50.0) is idle because it has no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that raw materials (e.g., iron ore or copper ore) are transported to the furnace for smelting.\n\n#### General Tips for Burner Entities\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner entities to avoid interruptions in mining or item transfer operations."}
