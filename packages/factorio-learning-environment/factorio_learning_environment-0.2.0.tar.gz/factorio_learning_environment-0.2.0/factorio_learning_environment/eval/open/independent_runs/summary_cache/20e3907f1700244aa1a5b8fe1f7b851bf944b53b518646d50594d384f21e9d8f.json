{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is currently out of fuel and has a full chest at the drop position, preventing further mining.\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Positioned at (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), and (x=8.5, y=-60.5), each containing iron plates.\n  - Positioned at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Positioned at (x=-4.5, y=-52.5) and (x=-5.5, y=-52.5) containing iron plates and iron ore respectively.\n  - Positioned at (x=-3.5, y=-52.5) containing a significant amount of iron plates.\n  - Positioned at (x=-2.5, y=-52.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Positioned at (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), (x=-12.5, y=-50.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), and (x=-10.5, y=-50.5) with varying contents, including empty chests and those containing iron plates.\n  - Positioned at (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), and (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Positioned at (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) and (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) as iron chests, one of which is empty and the other containing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting:\n  - Positioned at (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), both working with coal as fuel and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Positioned at (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Supplying Furnaces\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply stone furnaces to avoid failed supply attempts.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Operations\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel.\n- Ensure that the chests at the drop positions of mining drills are emptied regularly to prevent mining operations from halting due to full chests.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No specific utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int, representing the amount of iron ore in the inventory.\n- `iron_plate`: int, representing the amount of iron plates in the inventory.\n- `iron_gear_wheel`: int, representing the amount of iron gear wheels in the inventory.\n- `wooden_chest`: int, representing the number of wooden chests in the inventory."}
