{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) for moving coal from the mining drill to the transport system.\n- Transport Belt system connecting positions (43.5, -82.5) to (43.5, -79.5) for transporting coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the intended position is clear of obstructions before placing entities like Wooden Chests or extending transport belts.\n\n### Errors with transport belt connections\n- Verify that transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to ensure smooth item transportation.\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or another machine) to accept the output from production entities like mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with full output\n- Regularly check and clear the output of entities like furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
