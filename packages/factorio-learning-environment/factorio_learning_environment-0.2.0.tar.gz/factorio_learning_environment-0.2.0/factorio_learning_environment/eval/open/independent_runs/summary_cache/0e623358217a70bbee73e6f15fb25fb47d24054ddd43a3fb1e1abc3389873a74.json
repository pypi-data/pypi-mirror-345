{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for collecting coal\n- Multiple burner inserters have been placed and replaced at various positions to feed coal from chest to drill\n- Current inserter at (43.5, -80.5) facing LEFT\n- System is operational but chest is getting full (331 coal)\n\n### Iron Smelting Operation at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Currently processing iron ore into iron plates\n- Manually fed with iron ore and coal\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Multiple attempts to place inserters failed due to existing objects in the way\n- Before placing entities, check if the target position is clear\n- Use place_entity_next_to with appropriate spacing to avoid collisions\n- Consider checking entity dimensions (width/height) before placement\n\n### Resource Management\n- Chest is getting full with coal (warning: \"chest at drop position is full\")\n- Implement regular chest emptying routine when contents reach certain threshold\n- Consider setting up transport system to move resources away from chest\n\n### Inserter Placement Strategy\n- Multiple attempts to place inserters at same coordinates (41.5, -81.5)\n- Develop a systematic approach for inserter placement\n- Keep track of existing inserter positions to avoid duplicate placement attempts\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Position objects for key structures:\n  - Coal drill: (41.0, -82.0)\n  - Collection chest: (41.5, -80.5)\n  - Furnace: (-15.0, -50.0)\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: For active mining/smelting\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: For full output\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: For empty input\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: For machines lacking materials"}
