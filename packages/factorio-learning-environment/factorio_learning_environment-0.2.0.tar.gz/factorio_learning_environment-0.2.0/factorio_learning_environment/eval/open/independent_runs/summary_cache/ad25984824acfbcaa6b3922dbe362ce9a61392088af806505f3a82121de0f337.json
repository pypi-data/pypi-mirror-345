{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Boiler** at Position (-5.5, 24.0) with status NO_FUEL, connected to pipes and a steam engine.\n- **Steam Engine** at Position (-1.5, 24.5) with status WORKING, connected to small electric poles and pipes.\n- **Offshore Pump** at Position (-9.5, 24.5) with status WORKING, supplying water to the boiler through connected pipes.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting various positions, facilitating the flow of water and steam.\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Furnace** at Position (6.0, -62.0) with status WORKING, containing copper ore and producing copper plates.\n\n### Lab at Position (Not specified)\nConsists of:\n- **Lab** with status MISSING_SCIENCE_PACKS, set to research logistics but lacking the necessary science packs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Automation Science Pack\n- Ensure the presence of a crafting machine or furnace for crafting items like copper plates, which are prerequisites for automation science packs. Copper plates cannot be crafted directly without the appropriate setup.\n\n### Errors Related to Boiler Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to maintain its operation. A boiler without fuel will not generate steam, affecting the connected steam engine's performance.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Science Packs in Lab\n- Before initiating research, ensure that the lab is supplied with the necessary science packs to avoid interruptions in research progress."}
