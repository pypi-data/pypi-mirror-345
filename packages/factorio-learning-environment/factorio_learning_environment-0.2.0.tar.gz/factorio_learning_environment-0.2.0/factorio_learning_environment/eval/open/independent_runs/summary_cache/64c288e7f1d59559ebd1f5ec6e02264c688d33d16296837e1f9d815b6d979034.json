{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Location**: Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) to Position(x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n- **Components**:\n  - **Burner Mining Drill** at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=-15.5, y=-51.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=-13.5, y=-51.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to a transport belt.\n  - **Transport Belt** starting at Position(x=-13.5, y=-51.5) and ending at Position(x=-11.5, y=-51.5), moving iron ore to the furnace.\n  - **Stone Furnace** at Position(x=0.0, y=0.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=0.5, y=-1.5) transferring iron ore from the transport belt to the furnace.\n  - **BeltGroup** connecting the mining area to the furnace, facilitating the movement of iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Resources\n- **Issue**: Attempted to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory.\n- **Solution**: Ensure sufficient resources are available in the inventory before attempting to insert items into entities.\n\n### Errors due to Undefined Variables\n- **Issue**: Attempted to move to a position using an undefined variable `belt_line`.\n- **Solution**: Define all variables before use and ensure they are correctly initialized.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified item into a target entity. \n  - **Failure Mode**: Fails if the item is not available in the inventory.\n  - **Success Mode**: Successfully inserts the item if available.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **furnace**: Represents the furnace entity where items are inserted.\n- **belt_line**: Undefined in the current context, leading to errors. Ensure it is defined before use."}
