{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-2.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.5, y=-2.0) with 46 coal remaining\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=20.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the components\n- Small electric poles for power distribution (positions x=0.5, y=25.5 through x=40.5, y=37.5)\n\nThis power generation system is operational with the boiler showing WORKING status. The steam engine is also working, with steam flowing through the pipes. The system is generating electricity for the factory.\n\n### Non-functional Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5) with 18 coal remaining\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=2.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the components\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\n\nThe power generation system is experiencing connection issues. The boiler is reporting \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\" warnings, indicating problems with the water supply from the offshore pump.\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at positions(10.0, 10.0) to (20.0, 10.0)\nConsists of:\n- Iron furnace (position x=10.0, y=10.0) with 10 coal and 20 iron ore\n- Iron furnace (position x=20.0, y=10.0) with 10 coal and 20 iron ore\n- Copper furnace (position x=15.0, y=10.0) without fuel\n\nThese furnaces have been placed to smelt iron and copper ore, but the copper furnace lacks fuel to operate.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System at positions(15.5, 70.5) to (38.0, 73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drills (positions x=15.5, y=70.5; x=18.5, y=70.5; x=21.5, y=70.5) - WORKING\n- Iron ore storage chests (positions x=15.5, y=72.5; x=18.5, y=72.5; x=21.5, y=72.5) containing 96, 269, and 279 iron ore respectively\n- Burner inserter (position x=16.5, y=72.5) with 8 coal\n- Transport belt system connecting mining to smelting\n- Stone furnaces for smelting (positions x=28.0, y=73.0 to x=38.0, y=73.0) with various coal amounts\n- Working iron smelting furnace (position x=28.0, y=73.0) with 23 coal, 14 iron ore, producing iron plates\n\nThis system mines iron ore and transports it to furnaces for smelting into iron plates. The mining drills are working but some report that the output chests are full.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting System at positions(-55.5, 79.5) to (-45.0, 80.0)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drills (positions x=-55.5, y=79.5; x=-52.5, y=79.5; x=-49.5, y=79.5) - WORKING\n- Copper ore storage chests (positions x=-52.5, y=81.5; x=-49.5, y=81.5) containing 279 and 229 copper ore respectively\n- Transport belt system connecting mining to smelting\n- Stone furnace for smelting (position x=-45.0, y=80.0) with 30 coal, 14 copper ore, producing copper plates\n\nThis system mines copper ore and transports it to a furnace for smelting into copper plates. The mining drills are working but report that the output chests are full.\n\n### Assembly Line at positions(-7.5, 30.5) to (8.5, 38.5)\nConsists of:\n- Iron gear wheel assembler (position x=-7"}
