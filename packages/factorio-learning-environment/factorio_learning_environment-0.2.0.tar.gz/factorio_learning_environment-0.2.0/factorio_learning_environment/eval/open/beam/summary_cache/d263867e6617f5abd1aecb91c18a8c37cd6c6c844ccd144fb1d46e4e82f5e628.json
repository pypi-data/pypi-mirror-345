{"content": "Great! You've successfully harvested enough stone and crafted a Stone Furnace. Now, let's proceed to craft a Boiler and set it up in your system. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Craft the Boiler**: Now that you have a Stone Furnace, check if you have enough Iron Plates to craft a Boiler.\n\n2. **Place the Boiler**: Once crafted, place the Boiler in the correct position to connect it to the Offshore Pump and Steam Engine.\n\n3. **Connect the Boiler**: Ensure the Boiler is connected to the Offshore Pump for water and to the Steam Engine for steam production.\n\nHere's the code to achieve these steps:\n\n```python\n# Check inventory for Iron Plates\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\niron_plates_available = current_inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\n\n# Craft the Boiler if you have enough Iron Plates\nif iron_plates_available >= 5:\n    craft_item(Prototype.Boiler, 1)\n    print(\"Crafted Boiler.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough Iron Plates to craft Boiler.\")\n\n# Assuming the Boiler is crafted, place it\nboiler_position = Position(x=2.0, y=0.0)  # Adjust this position as needed\nplace_entity(Prototype.Boiler, boiler_position)\nprint(f\"Placed Boiler at {boiler_position}.\")\n\n# Connect the Boiler to the Offshore Pump and Steam Engine\noffshore_pump = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})[0]\nsteam_engine = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})[0]\n\n# Ensure connections\nassert connect_entities(offshore_pump, boiler_position), \"Failed to connect Offshore Pump to Boiler.\"\nassert connect_entities(boiler_position, steam_engine), \"Failed to connect Boiler to Steam Engine.\"\n\n# Check the setup status\nfinal_entities_status = get_entities()\nprint(\"Final Setup Status:\", final_entities_status)\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- **Positioning**: Ensure the Boiler is placed in a position where it can connect to both the Offshore Pump and the Steam Engine.\n- **Inventory Management**: Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have enough resources for crafting.\n- **Connection Verification**: After placing and connecting entities, always verify connections to ensure they are correctly established.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to complete the setup and get your power system running efficiently.", "summary_range": "[1-270]"}
