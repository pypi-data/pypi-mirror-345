{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), responsible for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring iron ore from the chests to furnaces.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron ore to another storage chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5).\n  - At position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a chest.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - At position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), producing iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), producing iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), storing iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), storing iron ore.\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), storing iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination inventory has enough space to accommodate items being transferred by the inserter.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Low on Fuel\n- Keep a steady supply of fuel for the burner mining drill to prevent interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n### UnboundLocalError: Cannot Access Local Variable\n- Ensure that all local variables are properly initialized before use in the code.\n\n### ValueError: Incorrect Argument Type\n- Verify that the correct type of argument is passed to functions, especially when dealing with entities or positions.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source inventory contains items for the inserter to transfer."}
