{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of 50 coal. The furnace is currently not operational due to lack of ingredients to smelt and a full fuel source.\n\n### Pipe Group at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pipe network connecting various points: (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5). The system is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Electric poles positioned at various coordinates: (x=-1.5, y=20.5), (x=-0.5, y=21.5), (x=-1.5, y=21.5), ..., (x=0.5, y=16.5), (x=-8.5, y=18.5), (x=-8.5, y=19.5). The network currently has no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing offshore pumps\n- Ensure that the position for placing an offshore pump is suitable and adjacent to a water source.\n\n### Errors when placing boilers and steam engines\n- Verify that the position for placing boilers and steam engines is suitable and not obstructed by other entities or terrain.\n\n### Connection errors between offshore pumps and boilers\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between offshore pumps and boilers. Check for any obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles\n- Make sure electric poles are placed correctly and within range to connect with each other to form a continuous network.\n\n### Errors with move_to function\n- When using the move_to function, ensure that the position argument is correctly formatted as a Position object and not a string.\n\n### Errors when picking up entities\n- Ensure that the second argument when picking up an entity is a valid Position object to avoid errors."}
