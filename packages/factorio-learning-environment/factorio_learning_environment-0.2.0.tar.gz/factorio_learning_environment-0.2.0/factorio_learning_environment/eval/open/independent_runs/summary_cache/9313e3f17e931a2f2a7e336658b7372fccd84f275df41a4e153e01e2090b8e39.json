{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Connected via a series of pipes forming a PipeGroup for fluid transport\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Copper Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items between entities\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Multiple PipeGroups for fluid transport, currently empty\n- Electricity network with small electric poles connecting various entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, coal was missing when trying to refuel the boiler.\n\n### Errors When Accessing Non-Existent Entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to interact with it. For instance, an error occurred when trying to access a lab at position (7.5, -61.5) which was not present.\n\n### Errors Related to Full Output or Lack of Ingredients\n- Regularly check and manage the output of furnaces and other processing units to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process, as indicated by warnings of no ingredients to smelt."}
