{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has not successfully placed any entities, as indicated by the logs showing \"Entities on the map: []\".\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities is buildable. Check the terrain and any existing entities that might block placement.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the tile is not already occupied by another entity or marked as non-buildable.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for entity operation\n- Ensure that entities like furnaces have the necessary resources (e.g., coal) to operate once placed.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure the placement logic accounts for build restrictions and environmental settings.\n\n### Inventory management\n- Regularly check the inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for building and crafting."}
