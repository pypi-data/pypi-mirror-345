{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- **Consists of:**\n  - **Steam Engine** at position (x=5.5, y=21.5), generating power.\n  - **Boiler** at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0), connected to the steam engine and refueled with coal.\n  - **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), supplying water to the boiler.\n  - **Pipe Network** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine, facilitating the flow of water and steam.\n\n#### Lab at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- **Consists of:**\n  - **Lab** with input of automation science packs but no research in progress.\n  - **Connected to Power Supply** ensuring the lab has electricity for operation.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors in Setting Research\n- Ensure that the research is correctly set up in the lab. Verify that the lab has the necessary science packs and that a research topic is selected.\n\n#### Errors in Refueling Boiler\n- Before attempting to refuel the boiler, check the coal inventory to ensure there is enough coal available. Harvest more coal if necessary before refueling.\n\n#### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and the steam engine. Ensure there are no missing or misaligned pipes that could disrupt the flow of steam.\n\n#### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n#### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
