{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nThis structure is responsible for generating electricity and consists of the following components:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with segments at positions (-5.5, 16.5) and (-8.5, 23.5)\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various components and extending the electric network:\n  - Pole at position (-1.5, 16.5) connected to network at (-6.5, 16.5)\n  - Pole at position (0.5, 16.5) connected to steam engine\n  - Pole at position (0.5, 21.5) connected to steam engine\n  - Pole at position (0.5, 24.5) connected to network at (0.5, 21.5)\n  - Pole at position (-5.5, 25.5) connected to steam engine\n  - Pole at position (-7.5, 15.5) connected to network at (-6.5, 16.5)\n  - Pole at position (-3.5, 22.5) connected to network at (-7.5, 15.5)\n  - Pole at position (-4.5, 22.5) connected to network at (-3.5, 22.5)\n  - Pole at position (-3.5, 20.5) connected to network at (-4.5, 22.5)\n  - Pole at position (-3.5, 19.5) connected to network at (-3.5, 20.5)\n  - Pole at position (-1.5, 18.5) connected to steam engine\n  - Pole at position (-1.5, 22.5) connected to steam engine\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- This structure is currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure that the location for placing small electric poles is not overlapping with water or other obstructions. Attempting to place poles in such locations will result in failure. Always verify the terrain before placement.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like boilers. Running out of resources like coal will prevent successful insertion.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipe connections between entities such as offshore pumps and boilers are correctly established. Verify that the correct entities are targeted and that the connection path is clear to avoid failures in connecting pipes."}
