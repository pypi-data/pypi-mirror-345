The agent did not have enough iron ore and wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when harvesting wood\n- The agent attempts to harvest wood but encounters a \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" error. This indicates an issue with how the wood position is being handled, likely when indexing a string that is expected to be an integer.\n- The agent also fails to harvest wood because \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\". This error suggests that the movement logic is also using string indices where integers are expected.\n- The agent also fails to harvest wood because \"Could not harvest. Nothing within reach to harvest\". This indicates that the agent is not close enough to the wood to harvest it.\n- Ensure that the wood position is correctly formatted as integers before using it for movement or harvesting.\n- Ensure you can move to the target entity where you want to harvest from before harvesting items\n\n### Errors related to inserters being blocked\n- The inserters at (40.5, -80.5), (6.5, -57.5) and (8.5, -57.5) are blocked by transport belts.\n- Ensure that inserters are not blocked by other entities, such as transport belts, before attempting to use them.\n\n### Errors related to transport belts disappearing\n- The transport belt at (39.5, -80.5) is no longer there.\n- Before attempting to interact with a transport belt, ensure that it still exists at the expected location.\n\n### Errors related to inserter fuel\n- The inserter already has fuel.\n- Before inserting fuel into an inserter, check if it already has fuel.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- 'transport-belt': int\n- 'burner-inserter': int\n- 'wood': int\n- 'coal': int\n- 'iron-plate': int\n```"}
