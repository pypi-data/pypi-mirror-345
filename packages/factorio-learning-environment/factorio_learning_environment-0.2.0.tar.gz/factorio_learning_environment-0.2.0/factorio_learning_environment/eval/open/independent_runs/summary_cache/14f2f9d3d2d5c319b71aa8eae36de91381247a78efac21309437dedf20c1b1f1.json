{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with coal as fuel, currently working but output is blocked due to item on the ground. It is connected to a Stone Furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt and is not producing any output.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target tile is free and suitable for placing the entity before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities or obstacles that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid positions\n- Verify that the destination position for moving an entity is valid and unoccupied before attempting the move.\n\n### Errors related to entity extraction and placement\n- Move closer to the target entity before attempting to extract items or interact with it to avoid errors related to distance.\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a valid sink entity or storage to accept outputs from production entities like drills to prevent blockage and ensure continuous operation."}
