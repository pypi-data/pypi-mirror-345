{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Storage system with multiple chests:\n  - Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-84.5) storing coal (1600)\n  - Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) storing coal (1600)\n  - Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) storing coal (800)\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around x=45-47, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n  - Second furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n- Input chest (wooden) with iron ore (x=45.5, y=-79.5)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter (x=44.5, y=-79.5)\n  - Second inserter (x=46.5, y=-79.5)\n- Output storage chest (wooden) (x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing iron plates (1500)\n\nAdditional storage:\n- Wooden chest (x=45.5, y=-84.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities, verify there is enough clear space at the target location\n- Multiple attempts to place inserters failed due to existing objects in the way\n- When repositioning entities, remove existing entities first before placing new ones\n\n### Entity Positioning and Configuration\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with their source and target entities\n- Verify entity positions before attempting to interact with them\n- When moving or reconfiguring inserters, ensure the new position is valid and unoccupied\n\n### Resource Management\n- The coal mining system's output chest is full, causing mining to stop\n- Consider adding more storage capacity or consuming resources faster to prevent backup\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `first_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `second_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n\n### System States\n- Coal mining system: BLOCKED (chest full)\n- Furnaces: NO_INGREDIENTS (waiting for input)\n- Inserters: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS"}
