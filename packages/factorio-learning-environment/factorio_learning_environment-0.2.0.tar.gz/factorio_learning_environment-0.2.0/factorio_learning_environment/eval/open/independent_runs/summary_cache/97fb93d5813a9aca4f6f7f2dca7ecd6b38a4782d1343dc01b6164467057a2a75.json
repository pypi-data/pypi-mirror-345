Errors such as \u201cNo stone_furnace in inventory\u201d and \u201cNo Small Electric Pole in inventory\u201d indicate placement attempts without sufficient components.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all necessary raw materials and processed items (for example, at least 1 iron-plate and 2 copper-cables for crafting a Small Electric Pole) are available to meet recipe requirements.\n\n\u2022 Fuel and Operational Readiness:\n\u2003\u2013 Burner Inserters frequently report \u201cout of fuel\u201d or \u201cwaiting for source items.\u201d Monitor fuel levels closely and schedule timely coal refills to keep operations running smoothly.\n\n\u2022 Power Network Connectivity:\n\u2003\u2013 NO_POWER warnings require due attention. When reinforcing the network by adding electric poles, always confirm inventory availability to avoid placement errors.\n\u2003\u2013 The recent placement actions (e.g. new poles at (3.5, 22.5) and (-4.5, 17.5)) help improve connectivity, but similar operations must be preceded by inventory checks.\n\n\u2022 Fluid System Connectivity:\n\u2003\u2013 Boilers reporting \u201cno input liquid\u201d and \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d necessitate a review of pipe configurations. Verify that pipes are properly linked to an accessible water source and that connection points are unobstructed.\n\n\u2022 Placement Validation:\n\u2003\u2013 Errors in placing entities (as seen with the stone furnace at (-6.0, 19.0) and small electric pole at (-2.5, 20.5)) suggest that placement functions must validate inventory content prior to attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Implement a preliminary inventory check for each placement action to mitigate repeated placement exceptions."}
