{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a status warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with a status warning of \"no fluid present in connections\" and not connected to any fluid systems.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of 10 automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Attribute Access\n- Ensure that the attributes being accessed, such as `tile_dimensions` or `_width`, are correctly defined in the class. Verify that these attributes exist and are accessible.\n\n### Type Conversion Errors\n- When converting types, ensure that the variable being converted is of a compatible type. For example, when using `float()` or `int()`, ensure the input is a string, bytes-like object, or a real number, not a custom attribute like `ModelPrivateAttr`.\n\n### Unsupported Operand Type Errors\n- When performing operations involving different types, ensure that the operands are compatible. For example, adding an integer to a custom attribute type like `ModelPrivateAttr` will result in an error. Ensure proper type casting or conversion before performing such operations."}
