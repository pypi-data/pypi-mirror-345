{"content": "The error indicates that the function `ensure_craftable` is not defined in the current context. This typically means that the utility functions we discussed earlier have not been implemented or are not accessible in this execution environment.\n\n### Tips to Avoid This Error in the Future:\n\n1. **Define Utility Functions**: Before using any utility function, ensure that it is defined in the environment. If you plan to use functions like `ensure_craftable`, you need to implement them first.\n\n2. **Check Function Availability**: If you encounter a `NameError`, verify that the function is defined and accessible. You can do this by listing available functions or checking the documentation.\n\n3. **Use Basic Crafting Logic**: If utility functions are not available, you can directly check the inventory for required materials and craft items using basic logic. For example, check if you have enough coal and stone to craft the Burner Mining Drill and Stone Furnace.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to catch such issues and provide fallback logic. For example, if a function is not found, you can attempt to perform the operation manually.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nSince we cannot use the `ensure_craftable` function, let's manually check the inventory for the required materials and craft the Burner Mining Drill and Stone Furnace directly.\n\n1. **Check Inventory for Required Materials**: \n   - Burner Mining Drill requires 3 iron plates, 1 iron gear wheel, and 1 stone furnace.\n   - Stone Furnace requires 5 stone and 1 furnace.\n\n2. **Craft the Required Items**: \n   - If we have enough materials, proceed to craft the items directly.\n\nLet's implement this logic now. \n\n1. Check if we have enough coal and stone to craft the items.\n2. If we do, proceed with crafting. If not, we may need to gather more resources.", "summary_range": "[1-6]"}
