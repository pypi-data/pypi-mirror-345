{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (9 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (45 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, the error \"Could not place burner-mining-drill at (-21.0, -52.0), No burner_mining_drill in inventory\" indicates a missing item.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities at Occupied Locations\n- Before placing an entity, check that the desired location is unoccupied. Errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the desired location\" and \"Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location\" suggest that the target location is already occupied.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Setup\n- Verify the setup of your furnaces to ensure they are producing as expected. If a furnace is not producing iron plates, as indicated by \"The furnace is not producing iron plates. Check the setup,\" check that it has the necessary resources and fuel.\n\n### Errors When Placing Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the location for placing transport belts is valid and unoccupied. Errors like \"Cannot place Transport Belt at the desired location\" suggest an issue with the placement area."}
