{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5), currently out of fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -48.0) directly aligned with the mining drill's drop position, fueled with coal, producing iron plates.\n\n### Auxiliary Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), fueled with coal, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entities in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, attempting to place a burner mining drill without having it in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum distance for placement is 10 units, as seen when attempting to place a stone furnace at (-14.5, -48.5) from a distance of 50.62 units.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with incorrect spacing or direction\n- When placing entities next to others, ensure there is enough space and the correct direction is specified. Errors occurred when trying to place a burner inserter next to a mining drill with zero spacing and incorrect direction, potentially due to collisions or unsuitable terrain. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position."}
