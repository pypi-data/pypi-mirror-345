{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) - extracts crude oil (currently without power)\n- Storage tank at (22.5, 40.5) - stores extracted crude oil\n- Pipe network connecting pumpjack to storage tank (positions: (19.5,38.5), (18.5,38.5), (21.5,38.5), (20.5,38.5))\n\n### Partial Power Plant at (-8.5, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (-8.5, 20.0) - currently not functional (missing steam engine and proper water input)\n- Offshore pump at (-11.5, 21.5) - not yet connected to boiler\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (16.0, 21.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0, 21.0) - extracting coal\n- Wooden chest at (16.5, 23.5) - coal storage\n- Burner inserter at (16.5, 22.5) - transfers coal from drill to chest\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement distance errors\n- Entities must be placed within 10 tiles of player position - move closer before placing (occurred 3 times with chests and pumpjack)\n- When working with distant systems (like oil extraction), plan movement between sites carefully\n\n### Obstruction errors\n- Cannot place entities where pipes or other objects exist - fully clear area before placement (occurred 4 times with chest placement)\n- Steam engines cannot be placed on water - verify terrain before placement (occurred 2 times)\n- Chest placement requires 1 empty tile around target position - leave adequate clearance\n\n### Power plant construction\n- Steam engines must be placed adjacent to boilers with proper alignment (output facing away from boiler)\n- Complete power plant chain requires: offshore pump \u2192 pipes \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine\n- Verify water source is accessible before placing offshore pumps\n\n### System connectivity\n- Pumpjack requires power connection to operate - prioritize completing power plant\n- Boilers require both fuel input and water connection to function\n- Check fluid system connections when entities show \"no fluid present\" warnings\n\n### General tips\n- When removing entities, verify successful removal in inventory\n- For complex placements, check all surrounding tiles for obstructions\n- Consider building temporary power near distant operations like oil extraction"}
