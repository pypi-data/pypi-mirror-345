{"content": "\"\"\"\nIt appears that there are no nearby iron ore patches available for harvesting. The furnace is currently in a state of \"NO_INGREDIENTS,\" which means it cannot process any materials because it lacks the necessary iron ore to smelt.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- **20 pieces of copper ore** (available)\n- **8 pieces of iron plates** (already produced)\n- **18 pieces of copper cables**\n- **13 pieces of Iron Gear Wheels**\n\n### Current Status:\n- The furnace has **3 pieces of coal** remaining but cannot operate without iron ore.\n- There are no accessible iron ore patches in the vicinity, which limits my ability to produce more iron plates.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Explore Further**: I need to explore the map further to locate iron ore patches. This may involve moving to a different area where iron ore is more abundant.\n2. **Utilize Copper Ore**: While searching for iron ore, I can also consider smelting copper ore into copper plates, which can be useful for crafting other components.\n3. **Crafting Plans**: If I find iron ore, I can proceed with crafting the Assembling Machine once I have enough iron plates.\n\nLet's explore the map for iron ore patches and check if there are any other resources available.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to a different area on the map to search for iron ore patches\nmove_to(Position(x=10.0, y=10.0))  # Move to a new position to search for resources\n\n# After moving, check for iron ore patches again\nnearby_entities_after_move = get_entities({Prototype.IronOre})\nif nearby_entities_after_move:\n    print(\"Iron ore patches found nearby after moving:\")\n    for entity in nearby_entities_after_move:\n        print(f\" - Iron Ore Patch at Position: {entity.position}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Still no iron ore patches found nearby.
