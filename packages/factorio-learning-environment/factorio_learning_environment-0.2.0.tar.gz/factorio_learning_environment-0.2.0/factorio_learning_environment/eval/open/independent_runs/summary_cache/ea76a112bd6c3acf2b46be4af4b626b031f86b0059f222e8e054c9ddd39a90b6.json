{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (27.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (27.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with inserters and chests for input and output\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (19.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with inserters and chests for input and output\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (10.5, 0.5) with a recipe for copper cables\n- Inserters and small electric poles for automation and power supply\n- Belt group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of:\n- Belt group connecting various production facilities for efficient material transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters\n- Ensure there is a suitable position available for placing inserters. Check for obstructions and ensure the inserter can be placed without overlapping other entities.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Supply\n- Ensure that all machinery requiring electricity is connected to a power source. Check connections between small electric poles and ensure there are no gaps in the electricity network.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are available for production processes. For example, ensure copper plates are available for copper cable production.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent machinery, such as burner mining drills and boilers, have sufficient fuel to operate.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and assembling machines have the necessary ingredients to process and produce items."}
