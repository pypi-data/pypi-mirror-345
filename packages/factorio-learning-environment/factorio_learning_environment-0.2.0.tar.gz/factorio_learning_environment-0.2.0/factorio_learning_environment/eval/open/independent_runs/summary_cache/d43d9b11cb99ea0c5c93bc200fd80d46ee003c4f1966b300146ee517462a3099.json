{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map so far. Although the lab was targeted as the central research structure for supplying Automation Science Packs, repeated attempts to craft and position it have not resulted in any firm placement. Other entities\u2014such as furnaces used for smelting\u2014were referenced during resource processing but remain part of transient operations rather than completed, agent\u2010built structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, use the correct parameter format. Avoid unsupported keywords (for example, do not supply a 'radius' keyword if not part of the function\u2019s signature) and ensure that the number of arguments matches the expected count.\n\u2003\u2003\n\u2022 Handling empty or null query results\n\u2003\u2013 Always verify the output of get_entities before iterating over its result. If it may return None, substitute an empty list to prevent iteration errors.\n\u2003\u2003\n\u2022 Lab inventory and placement issues\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the lab item is available in the inventory before attempting placement. Validating resource availability prior to invoking placement operations can prevent errors related to missing items.\n\u2003\u2003\n\u2022 Resource and sub-ingredient shortages during lab crafting\n\u2003\u2013 Review the complete set of ingredients required for lab construction (including intermediary items such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) to ensure that production meets all recipe prerequisites. Adjust upstream production (smelting, crafting of intermediates) to resolve shortages before retrying lab crafting."}
