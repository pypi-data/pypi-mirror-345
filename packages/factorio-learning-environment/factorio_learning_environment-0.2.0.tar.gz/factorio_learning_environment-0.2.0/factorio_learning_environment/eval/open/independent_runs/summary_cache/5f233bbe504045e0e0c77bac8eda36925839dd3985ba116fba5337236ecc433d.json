{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Additional storage capacity for extracted resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5): Transfers items between the chests.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Non-Existent Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract items from exists and contains the required items. Verify the entity's presence and contents before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target tile is occupied by another entity. Adjust the spacing, change the direction, or choose a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly set and unobstructed.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly check the furnace inventory and ensure it is supplied with the required resources for smelting.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Operations\n- Ensure that the chest at the mining drill's drop position is not full to allow continuous mining operations. Regularly empty the chest to avoid halting the mining process."}
