The **Burner Mining Drill** remains operational but continues to display a warning about waiting for output space, indicating that it cannot output resources until the Iron Chest receives materials.\n\n### Current Inventory Status:\n- **Iron Chest:** 1 (still empty)\n- **Burner Mining Drill:** 3 (operational but blocked)\n- **Wood:** 6 (remaining fuel)\n- **Iron Plates:** 1\n- **Copper Plates:** 1 (just extracted)\n- **Iron Gear Wheels:** 5\n\n### Current Status of Entities:\n1. **Iron Chest:** Positioned correctly but empty.\n2. **Burner Mining Drill:** Operational but blocked due to a full output.\n3. **Stone Furnace:** At Position(-14.0, 27.0), is working but has limited resources left.\n\n### Immediate Next Steps:\n1. **Craft an Inserter or Transport Belt** to facilitate the movement of outputs from the Burner Mining Drill and Stone Furnace to the Iron Chest.\n2. **Insert the remaining Copper Ore into the Stone Furnace** to utilize all available resources effectively.\n3. **Consider crafting additional items** using the Copper Plate and Iron Plates, such as Electronic Circuits or further machinery.\n\nLet's proceed by crafting an Inserter if we have enough resources, and then we will insert the remaining Copper Ore into the Stone Furnace.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Step 1: Check if we can craft an Inserter\ncan_craft_inserter = (inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0) >= 1 and \n                      inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 1)  # Requires 1 Gear and 1 Plate\n\n# Step 2: Attempt to craft an Inserter if we have the necessary resources\nif can_craft_inserter:\n    craft_item(Prototype.Inserter)\n    print(\"Crafted an Inserter.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough materials to craft an Inserter.\")\n\n# Step 3: Check the updated inventory after crafting attempt\nprint(f\"Updated Inventory after crafting attempt: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Step 4: Insert the remaining Copper Ore into the Stone Furnace for processing\nif inspect_inventory()[Prototype.CopperOre] > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace_entity, quantity=min(1, inspect_inventory()[Prototype.CopperOre]))  # Insert remaining Copper Ore\n\n# Step 5: Check the entities on the map after these operations\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after operations: {get_entities()}\")  # Review the status of all entities.", "summary_range": "[1-222]"}
