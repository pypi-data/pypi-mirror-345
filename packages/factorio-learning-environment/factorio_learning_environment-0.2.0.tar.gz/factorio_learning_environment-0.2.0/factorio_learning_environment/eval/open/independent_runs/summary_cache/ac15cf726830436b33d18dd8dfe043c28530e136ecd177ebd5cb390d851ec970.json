{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: \n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (10,000 units available)\n  - Warning: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: Contains iron ore (11 units)\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours:\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Warning: Out of fuel\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients\n  - Fuel: Contains coal (6 units)\n  - Warning: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is properly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated checks indicate misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Keep the inserter and mining drill refueled to maintain continuous operation. The inserter frequently runs out of fuel, halting the transfer process.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly empty the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent mining stoppages. The chest frequently becomes full, stopping the mining process.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Input\n- Ensure the furnace receives the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace is repeatedly reported as not receiving iron ore, indicating a potential issue with the inserter setup or chest management."}
