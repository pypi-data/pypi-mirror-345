{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (0.5, 28.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Steam engine at position (7.5, 39.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with various pipe positions such as (-3.5, 26.5), (-2.5, 26.5), (0.5, 26.5), etc.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -82.5) for storing mined coal\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -83.5) for additional storage\n- Burner inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) for transferring items\n- Belt group connecting various positions such as (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron chest at position (0.5, 0.5) with iron plates\n- Iron chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (2.5, 0.5) for additional storage\n\n### Laboratory at Position (Not Specified)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Copper Plate Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Steam Pipes\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler at position (0.5, 28.0) and the steam engine at position (7.5, 39.5). Check for any missing or misaligned pipes that could prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connection\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network. Ensure there are no missing connections or electrical poles between the steam engine and the rest of the power network.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage Chests\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests, such as the wooden chest at position (40.5, -82.5), to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors with No Power to Lab\n- Ensure the lab is connected to a power source. Check the power network for any missing connections or insufficient power supply to the lab."}
