We currently have only 2 iron plates available, which is insufficient since we need 3 iron plates for the crafting.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Smelt More Iron Ore**: We need to insert the remaining iron ore into the stone furnace to produce more iron plates.\n2. **Check the Furnace**: We should ensure that the furnace is adequately fueled and ready to smelt the remaining iron ore.\n\nLet's insert the remaining iron ore into the existing stone furnace to smelt it into iron plates.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Insert the remaining iron ore into the existing stone furnace for processing\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, existing_furnace, quantity=1)  # Add the remaining iron ore into the furnace\n\n# Check the updated inventory after setup\nprint(f\"Inventory after inserting remaining iron ore into the existing furnace: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Updated Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check the updated status of the entities after the setup", "summary_range": "[1-210]"}
