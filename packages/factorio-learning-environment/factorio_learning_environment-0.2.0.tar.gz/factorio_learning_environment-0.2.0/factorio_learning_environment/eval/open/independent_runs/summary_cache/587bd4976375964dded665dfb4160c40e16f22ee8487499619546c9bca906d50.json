{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (0.5, 28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Steam engine at position (7.5, 39.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -82.5) for coal storage\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -83.5) for additional storage\n- Burner inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) for moving items\n- Belt group with belts connecting various positions for coal transport\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Iron chest at position (0.5, 0.5) containing iron plates\n- Iron chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (2.5, 0.5) for additional storage\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Inventory management for copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently lacking power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Ensure that boilers and mining drills are consistently fueled to maintain operation. Regularly check and refill coal as needed.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connection\n- Connect the steam engine to the power network to ensure electricity generation. Verify connections between poles and the steam engine.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full inventories.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Management\n- Ensure that the fluid systems are properly connected and contain the necessary fluids for operation. Check for any disconnections or empty fluid boxes.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operation\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path and are correctly oriented to move items between entities effectively."}
