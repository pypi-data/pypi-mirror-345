{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between positions (-9.5, 24.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and (-5.5, 24.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with automation science packs, not receiving power\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup 3400 at position (-0.5, 10.5)\n- PipeGroup 3407 at position (-9.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup 3409 at position (-7.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup 3411 at position (1.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup 3413 at position (-6.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Networks\n- ElectricityGroup 61625 with poles at various positions, voltage 0\n- ElectricityGroup 61635 with poles at various positions, voltage 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Verify that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors in Power Distribution\n- Verify that all electrical components, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a powered electric pole. Ensure that the electricity network is complete and has a power source.\n\n### Errors When Inspecting and Clearing Obstructions\n- When using functions that require an Entity object as the first argument, ensure the second argument is None to avoid inspection errors.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid entities like boilers and offshore pumps are properly connected with pipes. Check for any missing or incorrectly placed pipes that could prevent fluid flow."}
