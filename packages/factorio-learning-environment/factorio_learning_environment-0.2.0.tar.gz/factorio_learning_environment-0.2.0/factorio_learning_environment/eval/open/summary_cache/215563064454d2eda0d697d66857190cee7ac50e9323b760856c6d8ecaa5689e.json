{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a mining and smelting structure for iron ore:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest\n\nThis structure is fueled by coal inserted into the mining drill, furnace, and inserters to keep them operational. The entities are placed in close proximity to facilitate item transfer.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing entities due to occupied tiles\n- When placing an inserter or chest next to another entity, ensure the target tile is free. For example, attempts to place a burner inserter next to the furnace failed because a wooden chest occupied the target tile.\n- Similarly, attempts to place a wooden chest next to an existing chest failed because a burner inserter was already occupying the intended tile.\n- To avoid these errors, increase the spacing parameter when placing entities, change the placement direction, or choose a different reference position to find a free tile.\n\n### Fuel management issues causing stoppages\n- Several entities including the burner mining drill, furnace, and inserters experienced \"out of fuel\" or \"no fuel\" warnings, causing them to stop working.\n- Regularly insert sufficient coal into all burner-type entities to maintain continuous operation.\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels as well, since they require fuel to operate.\n\n### Inserter status indicating waiting conditions\n- Inserters sometimes showed \"waiting for source items\" or \"waiting for space in destination,\" indicating supply or output congestion issues.\n- Ensure source inventories have items to supply and destination inventories have space to receive items to keep inserters active.\n\nOverall, careful tile management when placing entities and consistent fueling of burner entities will improve factory stability and throughput."}
