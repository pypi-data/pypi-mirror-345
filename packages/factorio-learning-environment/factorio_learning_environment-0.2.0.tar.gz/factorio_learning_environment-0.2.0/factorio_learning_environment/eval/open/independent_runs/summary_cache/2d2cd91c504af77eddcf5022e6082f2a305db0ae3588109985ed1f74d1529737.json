{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around x=41, y=-80)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5)\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -80.0)\n\nThe system appears to be a coal mining setup with automated transport, though currently the belt is blocked and furnace has no ingredients.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- When placing entities, ensure there are no dropped items in the target location that could block placement\n- Use clear_area() before attempting to place entities in areas where items might have dropped\n\n### Belt-Furnace Integration Issues\n- The current setup shows issues with belt-to-furnace feeding\n- Ensure proper alignment between transport belts and furnace input positions\n- Consider the direction of belt flow when positioning furnaces\n\n### Transport Belt Blocking\n- Transport belts are getting blocked, preventing proper item flow\n- Ensure there is a valid destination for items on the belt\n- Check if downstream entities can accept items from the belt\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\n### Functions\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places an entity adjacent to a reference entity with specified spacing and direction\n  - Failure mode: Cannot place when target position is blocked by items or entities\n  - Parameters: Reference position, spacing, direction\n\n### Entity States\n- Mining drill: WORKING\n- Inserter: WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- Furnace: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Chest: NORMAL"}
