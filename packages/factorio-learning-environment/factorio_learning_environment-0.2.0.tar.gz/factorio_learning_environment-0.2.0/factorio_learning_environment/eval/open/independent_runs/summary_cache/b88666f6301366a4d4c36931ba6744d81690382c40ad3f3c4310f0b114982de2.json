{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\n- Connected to the electricity network\n- Currently conducting Automation research\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (1.5, 14.5), (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 6.5), (1.5, 10.5), and (1.5, 2.5)\n- Provides power to the lab and other connected entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Materials\n- Ensure you have enough materials before attempting to craft items. Check your inventory for the required quantities of each material.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like pipes or electric poles.\n- Ensure that the positions of entities to be connected are correctly aligned and within range.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Double-check variable names for typos or undefined variables. Ensure all necessary variables are defined before use.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that all conditions required for an entity to function (e.g., steam engine working) are met before asserting their status.\n\n### Errors When Checking Lab Status\n- Confirm that the lab entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it."}
