{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=27.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=27.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=5.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserters at positions (x=17.5, y=0.5) and (x=16.5, y=0.5) for moving items between the furnace and chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=18.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups connecting various fluid systems, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-14.5, y=14.5), status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-14.5, y=17.5), status: WORKING, fluid: water\n- PipeGroup at position (x=1.5, y=29.5), status: FULL_OUTPUT, fluid: water\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various structures, ensuring power distribution across the map\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly placed and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Verify that there are no obstructions or incorrect placements preventing the connection.\n\n### Errors when Placing Boiler\n- Before placing a boiler, confirm that the target location is clear of obstacles and suitable for placement. Avoid attempting to place boilers on unplaceable terrain such as water.\n\n### Errors when Using Entity Retrieval Functions\n- When using functions to retrieve entities, ensure that the entity exists at the specified position. Double-check the coordinates and entity type to avoid exceptions.\n\n### TypeError in Function Calls\n- Review function definitions to ensure the correct number and type of arguments are provided. Adjust the function call to match the expected parameters.\n\n### Errors due to Entities Not Connected to Power Network\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to the electricity network. Use small electric poles to extend the network to all necessary entities."}
