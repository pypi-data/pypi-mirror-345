{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a fuel inventory of coal, currently operational with a warning to empty the chest at drop position (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) storing iron ore, currently contains 11 iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) with a fuel inventory of coal, waiting for source items, connected to the burner mining drill and a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter to other entities, facilitating the movement of materials.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with an inventory of iron ore and iron plates, currently operational.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) with a fuel inventory of coal, waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace and a transport belt.\n- **BeltGroup** with inputs and outputs facilitating the movement of materials between the iron ore mining facility and the iron plate production facility.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available resources\n- Ensure that the required resources are available in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors related to full storage\n- Regularly monitor storage entities like chests to ensure they are not full. A full chest will prevent mining drills from depositing mined resources, leading to operational halts.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n- **mining_drill**: Annotated as a variable representing a mining drill entity. Ensure resources are available before attempting to insert items.\n- **important variables**:\n  - `wood: int` - Current count: 2\n  - `coal: int` - Current count: 10\n  - `stone: int` - Current count: 5\n  - `iron-ore: int` - Current count: 63\n  - `iron-plate: int` - Current count: 48"}
