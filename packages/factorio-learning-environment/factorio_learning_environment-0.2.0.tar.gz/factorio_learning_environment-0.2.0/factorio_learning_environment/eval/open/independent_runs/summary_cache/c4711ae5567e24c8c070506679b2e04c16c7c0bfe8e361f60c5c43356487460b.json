{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a status of \"out of fuel\".\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with warnings for \"out of fuel\" and \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a status of \"out of fuel\".\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) serving as the drop-off point for mined resources.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with warnings for \"out of fuel\" and \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Storage Area\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) with a status of \"normal\".\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to insert into furnaces or drills. This error occurred when attempting to insert coal into the iron and copper furnaces without having sufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when Entities are Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of all mining drills and furnaces to ensure they are operational. Currently, both the copper and iron mining drills are out of fuel, which halts production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used for inserting items into entities like furnaces and drills. It failed when there was insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n  - `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity.\n  - `iron_mining_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n  - `copper_mining_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity."}
