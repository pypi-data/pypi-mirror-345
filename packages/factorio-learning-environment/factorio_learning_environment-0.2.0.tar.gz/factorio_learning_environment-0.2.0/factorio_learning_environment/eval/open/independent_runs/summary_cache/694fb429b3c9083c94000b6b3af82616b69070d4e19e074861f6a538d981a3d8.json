{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -49.0)\n  - Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Current status: Working with 5 units of coal as fuel and producing iron plates.\n\n### Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (42.0, -83.0)\n  - Extracts resources and is currently working.\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground; no sink entity to accept output.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -81.5)\n  - Transfers items from the mining drill.\n  - Warnings: Chest is full; waiting for source items.\n- **Transport Belt** system\n  - Verified belts at positions (43.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -80.5) are aligned correctly.\n  - Connects the mining drill and inserter, facilitating the movement of resources.\n\n### Belt Group\n- Inputs and outputs are connected through a series of belts:\n  - Inputs: Belt from (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) moving right, and from (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5) moving down.\n  - Outputs: Belt from (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5) moving left.\n  - Status: Currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before attempting to place entities like Wooden Chests or Burner Inserters.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drills\n- Ensure there is a sink entity or storage to accept outputs from mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Inserter Operation Issues\n- Check that the destination entity (e.g., chest or belt) is not full to allow inserters to operate efficiently.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Verify that there is enough space and no obstructions at the intended placement position for entities."}
