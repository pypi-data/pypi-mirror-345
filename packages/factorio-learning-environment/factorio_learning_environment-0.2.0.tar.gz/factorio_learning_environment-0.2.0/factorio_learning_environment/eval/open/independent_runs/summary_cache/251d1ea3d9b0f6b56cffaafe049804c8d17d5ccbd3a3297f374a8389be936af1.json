{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0) receiving water and operational\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5) generating power\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a wooden chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5) to a wooden chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups at various positions, some are empty and others are operational, facilitating fluid transport across the map.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles distributed throughout the map, connecting various structures and ensuring power distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between entities. Check for any breaks in the pipe network and reconnect them properly to avoid the \"list index out of range\" error.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the burner mining drill and furnaces to maintain continuous operation and avoid \"out of fuel\" warnings.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to prevent \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings. Regularly supply raw materials to processing facilities.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Keep track of inventory levels to prevent chests from becoming full, which can halt operations. Regularly empty chests to maintain workflow efficiency."}
