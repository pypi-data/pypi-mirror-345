{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) connected to a transport belt system starting from (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) and ending at (x=-12.5, y=-58.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) which is currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer items from the furnace to a wooden chest at (x=-16.5, y=-64.5).\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a wooden chest at (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a wooden chest at (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer items to a wooden chest at (x=1.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to source items by checking the connected entities for available resources. Verify that the transport belts are correctly supplying items to the inserter.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials for smelting. Check the connected transport belts and inserters for proper item flow.\n\n### Transport Belt Misalignment\n- Verify that the transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to ensure a continuous flow of resources between entities."}
