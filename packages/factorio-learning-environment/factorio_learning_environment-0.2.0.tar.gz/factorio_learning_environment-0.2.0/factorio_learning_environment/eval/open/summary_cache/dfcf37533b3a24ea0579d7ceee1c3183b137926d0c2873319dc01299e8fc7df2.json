{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport belt at position (21.5, 73.5) moving iron plates away from the chest.\n\nThis structure forms a connected iron plate production line from ore extraction to plate output onto a belt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel management for burner inserters and machines\n- Always ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory before attempting to insert fuel into burner inserters or machines. Multiple errors occurred due to attempts to insert coal when inventory was empty.\n- Regularly harvest and stockpile coal near the factory to avoid fuel shortages.\n- Insert coal into all fuel-dependent entities (mining drill, furnace, inserters) promptly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Handling inserter status and blocking issues\n- Inserters may become blocked waiting for source items or waiting for space in the destination. Monitor and manage inventories and output flow to prevent bottlenecks.\n- The ore inserter frequently waits for space in the furnace; ensure the furnace output is cleared or moved downstream efficiently.\n- The plate inserter often waits for source items; ensure iron plates are available in the chest for extraction.\n\n### Inventory and insertion errors\n- Avoid attempting to insert items (coal) when the inventory is empty, as this causes exceptions.\n- Before insertion commands, verify the inventory has sufficient quantity of the item.\n- Clear or manage chest inventories to prevent blocking inserters due to full chests.\n\n### Placement and connection of transport belts and inserters\n- When placing belts or inserters, ensure the target tiles are free to avoid placement failures.\n- The transport belt placement at (21.5, 73.5) succeeded after adjusting spacing, demonstrating the need for careful spatial planning.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
