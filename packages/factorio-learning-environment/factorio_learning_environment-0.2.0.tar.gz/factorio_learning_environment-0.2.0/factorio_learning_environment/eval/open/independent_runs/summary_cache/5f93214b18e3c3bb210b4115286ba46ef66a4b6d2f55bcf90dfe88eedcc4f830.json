{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line\nA line of 4 stone furnaces with input and output logistics:\n- 4 stone furnaces at positions (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0)\n- Input system:\n  - 4 wooden chests at positions (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), and (6.5,-2.5)\n  - 4 burner inserters at positions (0.5,-1.5), (2.5,-1.5), (4.5,-1.5), and (6.5,-1.5) moving items from chests to furnaces\n- Output system:\n  - 4 wooden chests at positions (-2.5,0.5), (2.5,1.5), (4.5,1.5), and (6.5,1.5)\n  - Multiple burner inserters for output handling:\n    - At (-1.5,0.5) moving items from first furnace to chest\n    - At (0.5,1.5), (1.5,1.5), (3.5,1.5), and (5.5,1.5) moving items between furnaces and output chests\n\nThe structure is designed to smelt iron plates with automated input and output handling. Currently contains some iron plates and coal distributed across various chests and furnaces.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters near existing entities\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces, ensure proper spacing parameter is used to avoid collision with existing entities\n- Consider the tile dimensions of target entities (furnaces are 2x2 tiles) when calculating inserter placement positions\n- Verify the target position is free before attempting to place new entities\n\n### Entity placement coordination errors\n- When placing multiple entities that need to work together (like inserters and furnaces), plan the layout considering the working space needed for each entity\n- Account for the full tile dimensions of all entities in the planned structure\n- Use appropriate spacing and offset calculations to ensure entities can be placed without overlapping"}
