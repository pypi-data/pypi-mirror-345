{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0), extracting coal and depositing into a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0), extracting copper ore and iron ore, connected via transport belts to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\".\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5), transferring items between a Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) and a Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) storing coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0), extracting iron ore and depositing into a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5), transferring items to the Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup connecting from (x=-25.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-23.5, y=-65.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting from (x=-24.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting from (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-56.5) and extending further.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that the transport belts are properly aligned and connected. Verify the presence of all necessary entities and their attributes before attempting to connect belts. This will prevent errors like \"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'\".\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that there is a valid sink entity to accept the output from mining drills or other production entities. This will prevent warnings such as \"output blocked by item on the ground\".\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Regularly check and maintain the supply of ingredients to furnaces to avoid warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt\". Ensure that the input logistics are correctly set up to supply the necessary materials."}
