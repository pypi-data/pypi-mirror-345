Use our iron plates to craft a burner inserter\n2. Place it near the mining drill to help with automation\n3. Craft some transport belts for item movement\n4. Keep track of our inventory changes\n\nThe goal is to start building some basic automation to handle the mining drill's output without needing chests.", "summary_range": "[1-128]"}
