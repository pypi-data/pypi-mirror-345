{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been created on the map as of the latest steps. The logs indicate that the agent attempted to place various entities, but none were successfully placed. Therefore, there are no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before attempting to place an entity. The agent attempted to place entities like Wooden Chests and Stone Furnaces at various positions (e.g., x=0.0 y=10.0, x=10.0 y=0.0, x=-100.0 y=100.0, x=50.0 y=50.0) but failed due to the tiles being occupied or invalid for placement.\n\n### Errors when checking for clear placement\n- Verify that the surroundings are clear for placement. The agent received multiple notifications that positions (e.g., x=-0.5 y=-0.5, x=0.5 y=0.5, x=1.5 y=1.5) were not clear for placement. Ensure that the area is free of obstacles or other entities before attempting to place new structures.\n\n### General placement strategy\n- Before placing entities, conduct a thorough check of the intended area to ensure it is suitable for the desired structure. This includes checking for any existing entities, terrain features, or other obstacles that might prevent successful placement."}
