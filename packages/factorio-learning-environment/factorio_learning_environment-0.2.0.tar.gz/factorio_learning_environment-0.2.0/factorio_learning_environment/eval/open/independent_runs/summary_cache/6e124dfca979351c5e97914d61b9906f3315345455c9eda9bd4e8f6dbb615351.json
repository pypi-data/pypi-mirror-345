{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (16.5, 70.5) now powered via electricity group 6954\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron plates (currently idle due to no input)\n- Connected to small electric poles at (16.5, 68.5) and other poles in group 6954\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Operation at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) (status unknown)\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 73.0) smelting copper plates (currently idle with \"NO_INGREDIENTS\")\n- **Burner inserter** at (-45.5, 71.5) transferring items (waiting for source items, fuel: 9 coal)\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (15.5, -0.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, -0.5) extracting coal (output blocked by full chest)\n- **Wooden chest** at (15.5, 1.5) full of coal (needs emptying)\n\n#### Power Generation Attempts\n- **Offshore pump** at (-20.5, -3.5) (new placement)\n- Multiple disconnected boilers and pumps from previous attempts remain\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent Water Placement Issues\n- Failed boiler placement at (-17.0, -20.0) due to water interference\n  - Solution: Validate land positions before boiler placement, maintain minimum 1 tile clearance from water edges\n- Small electric pole placement failure at (-17.5, -3.5) due to water overlap\n  - Solution: Use position validation that accounts for entity footprints near water\n\n#### Entity Placement Errors\n- Repeated burner inserter placement failures at (16.5, 72.5) due to existing obstruction\n  - Solution: Check for existing entities before placement attempts\n- Entity access errors when trying to get non-existent offshore pumps/mining drills\n  - Solution: Verify entity existence before interaction attempts\n\n#### Operational Issues\n- Mining drills remain unpowered despite some progress\n  - Solution: Complete full power plant setups before expanding operations\n- Furnaces idle with \"NO_INGREDIENTS\"\n  - Solution: Fix ore supply chain before expanding smelting operations\n\n#### Distance Management\n- Burner inserter placement attempt from too far away (distance 74.35)\n  - Solution: Move within 10 tile range before placement attempts\n\n#### Power System Configuration\n- Multiple disconnected offshore pumps and boilers\n  - Solution: Complete full power plant setup (pump\u2192boiler\u2192engine) in one session before moving to next location\n  - Ensure proper spacing (2 tiles horizontal between boiler and engine)"}
