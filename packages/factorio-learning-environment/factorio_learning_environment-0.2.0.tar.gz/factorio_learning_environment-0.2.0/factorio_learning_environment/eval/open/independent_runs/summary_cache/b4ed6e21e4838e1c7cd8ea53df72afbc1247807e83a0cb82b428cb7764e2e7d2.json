{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron/Copper Smelting Setup\n- Furnace 1 at position(0.0, 0.0) - Currently working on copper plates\n- Furnace 2 at position(2.0, 0.0) - Currently idle\n- Furnace 3 at position(4.0, 4.0) - Currently idle\n- Furnace 4 at position(6.0, 4.0) - Currently idle\nAll furnaces are stone furnaces used for smelting iron ore and copper ore into plates\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) - Working, producing water\n- Boiler at position(-2.5, 24.0) - Currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine at position(4.5, 24.5) - Working, generating power\n- Connected with pipe system for water transport from pump to boiler\n- Connected with pipe system for steam transport from boiler to steam engine\n- Small electric poles connecting power to lab and other consumers\n- Current power network voltage: 713033\n\n### Research Setup\nLab at position(10.5, 0.5) connected to power grid, currently researching electronics technology with 26 automation science packs loaded\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items into entities\n- Ensure required items are crafted or gathered before insertion attempts\n\n### Research-related errors\n- Cannot research already completed technologies (e.g. Automation)\n- Need to complete prerequisite technologies before researching advanced ones:\n  * Need Electronics before Fast Inserter\n  * Need Logistics before Logistics 2\n\n### Errors with API attribute access\n- ElectricityGroup does not have a 'voltage' attribute\n- When accessing prototype attributes, use proper attribute access syntax\n\n### Errors when checking research progress\n- Verify research is actually in progress before checking progress\n- Handle cases where no research is currently active\n\n### Power system maintenance errors\n- Check fuel (coal) availability before attempting to refuel boiler\n- Maintain adequate coal supply for continuous power generation\n\n### Inventory management errors\n- Track resource quantities and ensure sufficient materials before operations\n- Plan resource gathering when supplies run low (copper ore, coal etc)"}
