{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Smelting Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace central to the smelting process. It receives ingredients (iron ore and coal) and produces iron plates. Two logistic subsystems have been developed around it:\n\u2022 Initial logistic subsystem:\n\u2003\u2013 Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5) placed next to the furnace to receive extracted iron plates.\n\u2003\u2013 Burner Inserter originally placed at position (43.5, -81.5) and rotated to feed items into the chest (later removed due to misplacement).\n\u2022 Updated logistic subsystem:\n\u2003\u2013 Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5), installed and rotated to face UP to pickup items directly from the furnace.\n\u2003\u2013 Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -84.5) placed to receive items transferred by the new burner inserter.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Placement conflicts \u2013 When attempting to place an entity (e.g., burner inserter) adjacent to an existing object (e.g., wooden chest), verify that the target tile is unoccupied by other entities. Adjust spacing or change direction/reference position to avoid collisions.\n\u2022 Extended production delays \u2013 If the furnace does not produce the expected amount of iron plates after multiple iterations, confirm that the necessary ingredients (iron ore and coal) are present before initiating smelting to prevent timeout exceptions.\n\u2022 Insertion resource mismatches \u2013 Before executing an insert_item operation, ensure that the inventory contains the required resource (coal or iron ore) to avoid insertion errors."}
