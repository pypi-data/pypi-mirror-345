{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), currently working but with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing 381 units of iron ore.\n- Additional storage chests for iron plates and iron ore located at various positions:\n  - Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), each containing 183 iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chests at positions (-4.5, -52.5) and (-5.5, -52.5) containing 400 iron plates and 232 iron ore respectively.\n  - Iron Chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) containing 1476 iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chests at positions (-2.5, -52.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), containing varying amounts of iron plates and iron ore.\n  - Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing 326 iron ore and 1500 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with warnings of being out of fuel and full furnace result.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt and full furnace result.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from a full chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before attempting to extract items. Consider emptying the chest or redirecting the output to another storage.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract from a chest\n- Verify that the chest is not full and that there is a valid path to extract items. Ensure that the agent is correctly positioned to interact with the chest.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the final inventory state with items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
