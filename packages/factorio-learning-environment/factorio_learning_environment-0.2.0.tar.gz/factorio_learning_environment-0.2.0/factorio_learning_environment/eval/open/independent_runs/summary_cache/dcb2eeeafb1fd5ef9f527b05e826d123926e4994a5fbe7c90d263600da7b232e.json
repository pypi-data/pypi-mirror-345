{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with status WORKING. It is fueled by coal and processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) with status WORKING. It extracts coal and is connected to a transport system.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) with status WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS. It is responsible for moving items from the mining drill to the transport belt.\n- Transport Belt Group consisting of:\n  - Belt from (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) moving RIGHT.\n  - Belt from (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5) moving DOWN.\n  - Belt from (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5) moving LEFT.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Output is Blocked\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity available to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when Inserter's Chest is Full\n- Regularly monitor and clear the chest or ensure there is a continuous flow of items to prevent the inserter from being unable to place items.\n\n### Errors when Verifying Transport Belt Alignment\n- Double-check the alignment of transport belts to ensure they are correctly placed and oriented for efficient item transport."}
