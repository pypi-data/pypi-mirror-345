Since I have enough resources, I should consider crafting a basic crafting machine or using the existing furnaces to produce components that can lead to the Assembling Machine.\n2. **Check for Crafting Options**: I may need to craft intermediate items that can help in building the Assembling Machine.\n\nGiven that I have enough resources, I will attempt to craft a **basic crafting station** if it is available in the game, or I will explore the possibility of crafting components needed for the Assembling Machine.\n\nLet's check if I can craft any other intermediate items that might help in the process.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Attempt to craft an Iron Gear Wheel, as it is a component needed for the Assembling Machine\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel)\n\n# Check the inventory after attempting to craft the Iron Gear Wheel\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after crafting Iron Gear Wheel: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Review current overall inventory\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states.", "summary_range": "[1-284]"}
