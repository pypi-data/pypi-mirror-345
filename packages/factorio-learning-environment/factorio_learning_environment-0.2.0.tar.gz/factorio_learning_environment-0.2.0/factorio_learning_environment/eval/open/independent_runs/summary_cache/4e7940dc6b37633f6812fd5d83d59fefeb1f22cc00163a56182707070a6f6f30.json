{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently has iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently has iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently has iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently has iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for storage.\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions to facilitate the movement of copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storage.\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions to facilitate the movement of iron ore.\n\n### Various Belt Groups\nConsists of multiple belt groups at various positions facilitating the transport of materials across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure that there are no gaps between belts when attempting to connect them. The error \"Gap detected in belt placement\" indicates that belts are not aligned correctly. Double-check the alignment and continuity of belt placement before finalizing connections.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the inserters have access to source items. If an inserter is waiting for source items, verify that the source is correctly positioned and has available items to be picked up.\n\n### Errors with Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel. This ensures continuous operation and avoids production halts."}
