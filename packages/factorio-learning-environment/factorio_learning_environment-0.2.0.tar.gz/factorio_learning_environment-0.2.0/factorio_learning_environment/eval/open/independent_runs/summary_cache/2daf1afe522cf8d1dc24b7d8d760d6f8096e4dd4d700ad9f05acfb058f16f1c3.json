{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Storage System at x=41.0 to x=45.5, y=-86.0 to y=-80.5\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drills** at positions (41.0, -86.0) and (43.0, -86.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (41.5, -84.5), (43.5, -84.5), (41.5, -82.5), (41.5, -80.5), (43.5, -80.5), and (45.5, -80.5) for storing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -84.5) for transferring coal between chests and drills.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting System at x=-17.0 to x=-11.5, y=-52.0 to y=-48.5\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-17.0, -52.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-16.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -51.5), (-13.5, -48.5), and (-11.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -51.0) and (-13.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n#### Miscellaneous Storage\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (41.5, -79.5), (41.5, -77.5), (43.5, -76.5), (43.5, -74.5), (41.5, -73.5), and (43.5, -73.5) for storing various resources like coal and iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inventory Full Errors\n- **Issue**: Attempting to insert items into a full chest or furnace.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the target inventory has space before inserting items. Consider expanding storage by placing additional chests or redistributing items.\n\n#### Missing Items in Inventory\n- **Issue**: Attempting to insert or craft items without having the required resources in inventory.\n- **Solution**: Check inventory before attempting to insert or craft items. Extract necessary resources from storage or mining operations.\n\n#### Placement Errors\n- **Issue**: Attempting to place an entity without having it in inventory.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the required entity is in inventory before attempting to place it. Craft the entity if necessary.\n\n#### Fuel Management\n- **Issue**: Burner mining drills or furnaces running out of fuel.\n- **Solution**: Regularly check fuel levels and refuel entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n#### Chest Warnings\n- **Issue**: Chests at drop positions for mining drills are full, halting mining operations.\n- **Solution**: Empty or expand storage at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue operating.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **place_entity(Prototype, position)**:\n  - **Success**: Places the specified entity at the given position if the entity is in inventory and the position is free.\n  - **Failure**: Fails if the entity is not in inventory or the position is occupied.\n\n- **insert_item(Prototype, entity, quantity)**:\n  - **Success**: Inserts the specified quantity of items into the target entity if the inventory has space.\n  - **Failure**: Fails if the inventory is full or the required items are not in inventory.\n\n- **extract_item(position, quantity)**:\n  - **Success**: Extracts the specified quantity of items from the target position if items are available.\n  - **Failure**: Fails if no items are available at the target position.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **current_inventory**: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent.\n- **entities_on_map**: List[Entity] - Tracks all entities currently placed on the map."}
