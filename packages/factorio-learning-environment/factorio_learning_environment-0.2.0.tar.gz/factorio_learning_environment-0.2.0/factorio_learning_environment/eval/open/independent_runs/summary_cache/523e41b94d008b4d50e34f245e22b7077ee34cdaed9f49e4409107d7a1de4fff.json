{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Connected via a series of pipes:\n  - Pipe connections from the offshore pump to the boiler and from the boiler to the steam engine.\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=9.5, y=15.5) and (x=6.5, y=21.5) for fluid transportation.\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions for power distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that the boiler has sufficient fuel before attempting to operate. Check your inventory for available fuel resources like coal.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Inventory\n- Verify that the required items are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures or entities.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `boiler`: Represents the boiler entity used in the electricity generator structure.\n  - `pipe`: Represents the pipe entities used for connecting various components.\n  - `offshore-pump`: Represents the offshore pump entity used for water intake.\n  - `steam-engine`: Represents the steam engine entity used for power generation.\n\nThis report summarizes the current state of structures and provides guidance on common errors encountered."}
