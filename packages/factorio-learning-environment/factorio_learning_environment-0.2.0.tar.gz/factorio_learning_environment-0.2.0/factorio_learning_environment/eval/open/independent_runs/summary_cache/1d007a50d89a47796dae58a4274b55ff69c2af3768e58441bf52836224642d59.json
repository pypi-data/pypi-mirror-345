{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation System at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (5.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Furnaces at Positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0)\n- Each furnace is supplied with iron ore and coal\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5)\n- Inserters are configured to move items between chests and furnaces\n\n### Laboratory System\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\n- Connected to power via ElectricityGroup with poles at Positions (1.5, 2.5), (1.5, 6.5), (1.5, 10.5), (1.5, 14.5), and (3.5, 20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting and Inventory Management\n- Ensure that all required raw materials are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, wooden chests require wood, which must be gathered manually.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Verify that the destination for placing entities is valid and unoccupied before attempting placement. This includes ensuring that the inventory contains the necessary items for placement.\n\n### Errors in Power Connectivity\n- Regularly check power connections to ensure that all entities requiring power are properly connected and receiving power. This includes verifying that all poles are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connectivity\n- Ensure that all pipes and underground pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for any disconnections or misalignments that may prevent fluid flow.\n\n### Inserter Configuration Errors\n- Verify that inserters have valid source and destination entities. Ensure that the source contains items for the inserter to move, and the destination is capable of receiving them.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Ensure that all attributes used in code are valid and exist for the objects being manipulated. For example, check that the 'energy' attribute is correctly referenced for electricity-related operations."}
