{"content": "Based on the provided logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System (around x=41, y=-85)\n- Burner mining drill mining coal at (41.0, -85.0)\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -83.5) moving coal to storage\n- Wooden chest storing coal at (43.5, -83.5)\n\n### Iron Production System 1 (around x=-20, y=-54)\n- Burner mining drill mining iron at (-20.0, -54.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-18.5, -52.5) feeding ore to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -52.0)\n- Output burner inserter at (-16.5, -50.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (-16.5, -49.5)\n\n### Iron Production System 2 (around x=-14, y=-56)\n- Burner mining drill mining iron at (-14.0, -56.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-12.5, -54.5) feeding ore to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-11.0, -54.0)\n- Output burner inserter at (-10.5, -52.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (-10.5, -51.5)\n\n### Iron Production System 3 (around x=-6, y=-57)\n- Burner mining drill mining iron at (-6.0, -57.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-5.5, -55.5) feeding ore to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-4.0, -55.0)\n- Output burner inserter at (-2.5, -53.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (-2.5, -52.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n1. Distance related placement errors\n   - Move closer to target location before placing entities (max distance is 10)\n   - Example: Trying to place wooden chest at (-2.5, -52.5) from position (0,0)\n\n2. Missing resources for crafting\n   - Gather required raw resources before attempting to craft items\n   - Example: Attempting to craft stone furnace without having stone\n\n3. Entity placement conflicts\n   - Check if target location is clear before placing entities\n   - Verify terrain is suitable (not water) for entity placement\n   - Example: Failed to place stone-furnace due to occupied space\n\n4. Output blocking issues\n   - Ensure proper output chain is set up before starting production\n   - Multiple drills showing \"output blocked by item on ground\" warnings\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map, requires being within range and having the entity in inventory\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace3: Stone furnace entity reference\n- output_chest3: Wooden chest entity reference\n- drill_drop_position: Position(x,y) where mining drill outputs items\n- input_inserter_pickup_position: Position(x,y) where inserter picks up items\n- input_inserter_drop_position: Position(x,y) where inserter drops items"}
