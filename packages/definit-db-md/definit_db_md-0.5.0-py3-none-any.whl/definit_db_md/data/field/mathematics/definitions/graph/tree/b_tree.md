# b_tree

A self-balancing [tree](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/tree/tree.md) data structure in which each [node](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/node.md) has a value, and for each node, the values of all nodes in its left [subtree](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/tree/subtree.md) are less than its own value, and the values of all nodes in its right subtree are greater than its own value. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
