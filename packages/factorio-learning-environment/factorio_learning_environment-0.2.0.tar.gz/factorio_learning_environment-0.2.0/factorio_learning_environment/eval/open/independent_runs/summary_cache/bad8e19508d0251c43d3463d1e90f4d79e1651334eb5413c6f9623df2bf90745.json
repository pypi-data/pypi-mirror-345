{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator near (-9.5, -0.5)\nThis structure generates initial power for the factory. It consists of core components:\n*   Offshore Pump at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n*   Boiler at (x=-3.0, y=1.5) - Currently has no automated fuel source connected. Multiple attempts (Steps 48-55) were made to place a burner mining drill and inserter to feed coal, but these were unsuccessful due to placement errors.\n*   Steam Engine at (x=5.5, y=4.5)\n*   Associated pipes (PipeGroup starting at x=-8.5 y=-0.5 for water, PipeGroup starting at x=-4.5 y=1.5 for steam) and electric poles (part of ElectricityGroup id=1239) connecting the components.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when"}
