{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Storage System\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) for coal extraction.\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** used for coal storage at positions:\n  - (44.5, -84.5)\n  - (48.5, -88.5)\n  - (50.5, -90.5)\n  - (51.5, -91.5)\n  - (54.5, -93.5)\n  - (55.5, -94.5)\n  - (57.5, -95.5)\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Storage System\n- **Wooden Chests** storing iron gear wheels at positions:\n  - (43.5, -84.5)\n  - (49.5, -89.5)\n  - (52.5, -92.5)\n  - (56.5, -94.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production and Storage\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (61.0, -54.0) supplied with iron ore and coal for iron plate production.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (53.5, -93.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Multiple **BeltGroups** connecting various parts of the system, facilitating the movement of resources:\n  - BeltGroup with 7 belts from (45.5, -82.5) to (48.5, -79.5)\n  - BeltGroup with 51 belts from (43.5, -80.5) to (63.5, -50.5)\n  - BeltGroup with 67 belts from (42.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -46.5)\n  - BeltGroup with 49 belts from (44.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -54.5)\n  - BeltGroup with 23 belts from (49.5, -80.5) to (60.5, -69.5)\n  - BeltGroup with 19 belts from (49.5, -78.5) to (58.5, -69.5)\n  - BeltGroup with 19 belts from (50.5, -79.5) to (59.5, -70.5)\n  - BeltGroup with 23 belts from (59.5, -68.5) to (67.5, -54.5)\n\n### Inserter System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (62.5, -53.5) transferring items from a chest to the stone furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when redistributing items from full chests\n- Ensure that the target chest has enough space before attempting to redistribute items. Check the inventory status of the chests to avoid overflow errors.\n\n### Errors due to attempting to index field 'character' (a nil value)\n- Verify that the entity or field you are trying to access is not nil. Ensure that all entities are correctly initialized and accessible before performing operations on them.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items like 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'stone-furnace', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently present on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
