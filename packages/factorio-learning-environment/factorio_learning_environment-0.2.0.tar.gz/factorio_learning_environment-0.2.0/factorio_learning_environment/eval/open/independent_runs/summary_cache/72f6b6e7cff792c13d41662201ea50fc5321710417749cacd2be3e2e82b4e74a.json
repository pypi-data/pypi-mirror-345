{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Plate Production Line at y=1.0\nConsists of three stone furnaces with automated output collection:\n- Stone furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) - idle, with 23 coal\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) - idle, with 35 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (1.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from first furnace, 49 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (3.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from second furnace, 37 coal\n- Collection chest at position (1.5, 3.5) - containing 42 iron plates\n- Collection chest at position (3.5, 3.5) - containing 36 iron plates\n- Collection system addition:\n  - Collection chest at position (5.5, 3.5) - empty\n  - Burner inserter at position (5.5, 2.5) with 19 coal, waiting for source items\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line at y=7.0\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel with automated output collection:\n- Stone furnace at position (2.0, 7.0) - idle, with 38 coal\n- Stone furnace at position (4.0, 7.0) - idle, with 18 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (2.5, 8.5) - configured to extract from first furnace, 36 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (4.5, 8.5) - configured to extract from second furnace, 18 coal\n- Collection chest at position (2.5, 9.5) - containing 56 copper plates\n- Collection chest at position (4.5, 9.5) - containing 87 copper plates\n\n### Incomplete Power System\n- Offshore pump at position (-5.5, 26.5) - not connected\n- Multiple disconnected pipe groups scattered across the map from x=-8.5 to x=9.5 and y=15.5 to y=31.5\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors with resource management\n- Check inventory for required resources before attempting operations\n- Ensure sufficient coal is collected before attempting to insert into machines\n- When crafting items that require intermediate products, ensure you have all required materials first\n\n### Errors with pipe connections\n- Ensure pipes are in the inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Even after crafting pipes, they need to be in the active inventory slot when making connections\n- When connecting steam systems, verify the path is clear and within reach\n- Check if existing pipe connections are blocking new connection attempts\n- Remove blocking pipes before attempting to create new connections\n- When creating new pipe connections, ensure you have enough pipes in inventory for the entire connection path\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure there are no existing entities blocking the placement\n- Consider increasing spacing between entities if default spacing causes conflicts\n- Clear existing pipe groups before attempting to rebuild power systems in the same area\n\n### Errors with API usage\n- Use correct class names when checking entity types (use BeltGroup instead of PipeGroup)\n- Reference the correct API documentation for entity type checking\n- When rebuilding systems, ensure proper cleanup of existing entities first\n\n### Errors with furnace operations\n- Furnaces require both fuel and ingredients to operate\n- Check furnace warnings to identify missing requirements\n\n### Errors with direct crafting\n- Iron plates and copper plates cannot be directly crafted\n- Must use furnaces to smelt ore into plates"}
