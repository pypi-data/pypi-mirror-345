{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport Belts transporting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) moving iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) processing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing and Storage at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) processing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) moving iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Belt Networks\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-24.5, -69.5) to (-26.5, -69.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-21.5, -64.5) to (-21.5, -70.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-16.5, -64.5) to (-12.5, -58.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-17.5, -62.5) to (-17.5, -64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -62.5) to (-14.5, -65.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -53.5) to (-17.5, -59.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-12.5, -52.5) to (-12.5, -54.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-11.5, -51.5) to (-15.5, -55.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Furnaces\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect have valid attributes and are not NoneType. This error suggests that the target furnaces might not be correctly instantiated or referenced.\n\n### Errors when Using Attributes of NoneType\n- Always check that the objects you are working with are properly initialized and not None. This will prevent attribute errors like 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'.\n\n### Errors when Placing Belts\n- Verify that the placement logic for belts ensures they are connected to the correct entities and positions. This can prevent issues with belt connectivity and functionality."}
