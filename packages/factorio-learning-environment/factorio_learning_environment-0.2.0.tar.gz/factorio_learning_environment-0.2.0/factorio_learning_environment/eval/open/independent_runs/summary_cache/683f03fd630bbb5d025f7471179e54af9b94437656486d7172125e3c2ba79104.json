{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available resources\n- Ensure that you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into any entity.\n\n### Errors when aligning inserter positions\n- Verify that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position and the drop position aligns with the furnace's position. Misalignment will prevent the inserter from functioning correctly.\n\n### Errors when inserter pickup position is not aligned with the chest\n- Double-check the inserter's pickup position to ensure it matches the chest's position. This is crucial for the inserter to successfully pick up items from the chest."}
