{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the structures and providing error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System (around x=41.5, y=-82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Storage chest (wooden) at (41.5, -80.5) collecting mined coal\n- Output inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal to transport belt system\n- Belt system starting at (43.5, -80.5) extending to (46.5, -82.5)\n- Two furnace input inserters at (44.5, -83.5) and (46.5, -83.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup (around x=46.0, y=-81.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Iron plate storage chest at (49.5, -80.5)\n- Additional coal storage in iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Common collision points observed at:\n  - Transport belt placement at (44.5, -80.5)\n  - Burner inserter placement at (44.5, -80.5)\n  - Burner inserter placement at (46.5, -82.5)\n\n### Transport System Bottlenecks\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) is blocked, preventing coal flow\n- Clear blocked belts to maintain resource flow\n- Consider implementing overflow prevention mechanisms\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- `place_entity()`: Places game entities at specified coordinates\n  - Failures: Collisions with existing entities\n  - Success: When target location is clear\n\nImportant Variables:\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill type\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter type\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter type\n- `transport_belt`: TransportBelt type\n- `furnace`: Furnace type"}
