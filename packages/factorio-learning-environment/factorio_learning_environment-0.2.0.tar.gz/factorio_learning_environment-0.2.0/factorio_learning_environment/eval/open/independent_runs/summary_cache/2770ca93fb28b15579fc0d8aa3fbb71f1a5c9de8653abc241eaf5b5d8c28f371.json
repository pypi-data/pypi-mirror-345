{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -25.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter (position -21.5, 25.5) that puts into the assembling machine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes between entities. Check the surrounding area for any obstructing entities.\n\n### Errors when adding fuel to boiler\n- Make sure that the boiler is within range of a nearby entity that can accept coal before attempting to add fuel. Verify the positioning of the boiler and the availability of coal.\n\n### Errors retrieving entities\n- Confirm that the specified positions for entities (like lab and assembling machine) are correct and that those entities exist at those positions. Double-check the coordinates before attempting to retrieve them.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the intended placement area."}
