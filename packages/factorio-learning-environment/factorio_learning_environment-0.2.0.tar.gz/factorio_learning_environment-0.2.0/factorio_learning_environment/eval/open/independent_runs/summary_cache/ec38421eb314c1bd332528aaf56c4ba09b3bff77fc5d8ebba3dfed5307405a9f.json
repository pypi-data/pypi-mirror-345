Verify that the inventory is not full or missing required items.\n\n### Errors when interacting with non-existent entities\n- Double-check the coordinates and existence of entities before attempting to interact with them. Ensure that the entity type matches the expected type at the specified position.\n\n### Errors due to full output slots\n- Regularly check and clear output slots of mining drills and other entities to prevent operation halts. Ensure that the connected storage entities have enough space to accommodate the output.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Maintain a sufficient stock of required items in your inventory before attempting to supply them to other entities. Regularly monitor and restock your inventory to prevent operation interruptions."}
