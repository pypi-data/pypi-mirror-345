{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Three Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) actively converting iron ore to iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (9.5, -60.5) for additional storage purposes.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) storing iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing resources are regularly emptied to prevent production halts. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, which stops the mining drill from operating efficiently.\n- Multiple chests at positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), and (-8.5, -50.5) are full of iron plates. Regularly transfer contents to prevent overflow and maintain production flow.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Tracks the count of iron ore in various chests.\n  - `iron_plate_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Tracks the count of iron plates in various chests.\n  - `furnace_status: Dict[str, str]` - Tracks the operational status of each furnace.\n  - `mining_drill_status: Dict[str, str]` - Tracks the operational status of each mining drill."}
