{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace positioned at (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. In previous updates the furnace processed iron ore yielding up to 9 iron plates. In the latest cycle, after harvesting 10 additional iron ore and inserting them into the furnace, the inventory initially showed 17 iron ore, then after a smelting period 15 iron ore with 2 iron plates, and finally after an extra delay the furnace inventory stabilized with 11 iron ore and 5 iron plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors with Incorrect Insertion Arguments and Inventory Checks\n- Always verify that the target entity, not just a positional coordinate, is passed as an argument when inserting items. Additionally, ensure that sufficient inventory is available before attempting the insertion.\n\n### Insufficient Production Output Verification Failures\n- When asserting production outcomes, account for possible delays in smelting. Allow sufficient time for production to complete before validating outputs to avoid assertion errors such as expecting additional iron plates prematurely.\n\n### Resource Retrieval and Placement Timing Issues\n- Confirm that the resource location is correct and accessible prior to harvesting. Additionally, ensure synchronized timing between harvesting and inserting actions to maintain expected production cycles and inventory states.\n\n### Cumulative Production Delay and Timeout Management\n- Monitor production cycles closely; if smelting does not produce outputs as expected within anticipated time frames, adjust wait periods. This prevents premature assertions and associated errors in production verification.\n\nPrevious error tips regarding API usage, resource retrieval, insufficient fuel, insufficient input resources, and recipe access continue to apply unchanged."}
