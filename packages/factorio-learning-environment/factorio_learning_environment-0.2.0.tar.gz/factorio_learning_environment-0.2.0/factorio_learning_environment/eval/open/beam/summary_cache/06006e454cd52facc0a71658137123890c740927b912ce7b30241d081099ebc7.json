{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 8 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: 9 units of coal\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Waiting for space in destination as the output is full. Place a sink object at (-15.5, -51.5) to unblock.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is crafted or present in the inventory before attempting to place it. This includes stone furnaces, burner mining drills, and wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Verify that all necessary sub-ingredients are available before crafting an item. For example, ensure sufficient iron plates for crafting burner mining drills and gather raw resources like wood for crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Errors due to missing items for insertion\n- Check the inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into entities. For instance, ensure availability of coal before inserting into a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors related to entity status and functionality\n- Ensure that entities like burner mining drills are functioning correctly by checking their status and resolving any issues, such as ensuring there is space in the destination for mined resources.\n\n### Errors when using assertions without verifying conditions\n- Before asserting the status of an entity, confirm that all conditions for its operation are met, such as ensuring the burner mining drill is working by providing necessary fuel and output space."}
