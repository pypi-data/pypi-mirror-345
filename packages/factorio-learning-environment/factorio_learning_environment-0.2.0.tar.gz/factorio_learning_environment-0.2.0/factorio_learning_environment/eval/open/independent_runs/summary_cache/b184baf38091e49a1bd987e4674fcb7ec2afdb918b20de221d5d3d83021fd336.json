{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). The drill is currently out of fuel and its output chest is full.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (-14.5, -50.5) for storage purposes.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently with no ingredients to smelt and its fuel source is full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Out of Fuel in Mining Drill\n- Ensure that the Burner Mining Drill is regularly refueled to prevent it from stopping operations.\n\n### Errors due to Full Output Chest\n- Regularly empty the output chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to allow continuous mining operations.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the stone furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients to maintain production.\n\n### Errors due to Full Furnace Fuel Source\n- Monitor the fuel levels in the stone furnaces to prevent overfilling and ensure efficient fuel usage.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wooden-chest`: int, representing the number of wooden chests in the inventory.\n  - `iron-plate`: int, representing the number of iron plates in the inventory.\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int, representing the number of iron gear wheels in the inventory.\n\nNo utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
