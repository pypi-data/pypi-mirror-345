The agent repeatedly attempted to supply and craft a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) but did not succeed because no Lab was available in the inventory and necessary sub-ingredients for Lab crafting were missing. Although existing smelting facilities were referenced\u2014a furnace at position (5.0, 5.0) used for iron plate production and a copper furnace at position (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) used for copper plate production\u2014these were not newly constructed structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors with get_entities:\n  - Do not use unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) when calling get_entities. Follow the documented function signature.\n  - Avoid passing positional arguments if the function does not accept any; this ensures proper invocation of the API.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Issues:\n  - Verify that the Lab entity exists in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n  - When filtering entities (for example, labs), ensure that the returned result is an iterable (use an empty list as a fallback instead of None).\n  - Confirm that all prerequisite components (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available in the required amounts before reattempting Lab crafting.\n\n\u2022 Resource Production Verification:\n  - Before crafting complex items like a Lab, validate that the processes for smelting and assembling intermediary components (iron plates, copper plates, etc.) are correctly set up and yield sufficient resources.\n\n"}
