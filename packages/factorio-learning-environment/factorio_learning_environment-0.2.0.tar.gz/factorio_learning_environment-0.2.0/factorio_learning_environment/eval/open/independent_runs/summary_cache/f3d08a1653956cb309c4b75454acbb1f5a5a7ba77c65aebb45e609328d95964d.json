{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) and (-14.5, -45.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (1.5, 18.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 18.0), (-9.5, 22.0), (-3.5, 22.0), and (0.5, 22.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe and Pipe-to-Ground network connecting various positions\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 1.5), (-4.5, 0.5), (-2.5, 3.5), (-12.5, 16.5), (-15.5, 19.5), (-10.5, 19.5), (-16.5, 20.5), (-15.5, 20.5), (-12.5, 20.5), (-10.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-4.5, 23.5), (-14.5, 25.5), (-4.5, 24.5)\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup connecting inputs at (-11.5, -46.5) to outputs at (-8.5, -43.5)\n- Various belts connecting positions such as (-16.5, -49.5) to (-16.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -47.5), (-13.5, -46.5) to (-11.5, -46.5), and (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -43.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities overlapping water\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities like pipes and pipe-to-ground is not overlapping with water. Choose a different location that is clear of water.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. Remove any existing objects in the way to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers and burner inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors due to disconnected fluid systems\n- Connect all necessary pipes and ensure fluid systems are properly linked to avoid warnings about no fluid present in connections."}
