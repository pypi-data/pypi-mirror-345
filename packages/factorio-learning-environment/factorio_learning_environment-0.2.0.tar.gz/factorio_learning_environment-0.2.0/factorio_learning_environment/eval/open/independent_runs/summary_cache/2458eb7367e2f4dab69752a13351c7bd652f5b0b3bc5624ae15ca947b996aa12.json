{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity generator at position(-5.5, 3.5)\nConsists of offshore pump(position -9.5, -0.5), boiler(position -5.5, 0.0) and steam engine(position -5.5, 3.5)\n\n#### Crude oil processing factory at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of pumpjack(position 17.5, 40.5), oil refinery(position 22.5, 40.5) and associated pipes\n\n#### Lubricant factory at position(27.5, 40.5)\nConsists of chemical plant(position 27.5, 40.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied positions:\n  - Ensure the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n  - Example: Error in Step 4, Step 11, Step 15, and Step 16 when trying to place entities at occupied positions.\n\n* Errors when using undefined recipe names:\n  - Verify that the recipe name used is valid and correctly spelled.\n  - Example: Error in Step 6 when trying to set the chemical plant recipe to \"Lubricant\" due to an AttributeError.\n\n* Errors when connecting entities with incompatible fluid requirements:\n  - Ensure that the fluid output of the source entity matches the fluid input required by the target entity's recipe.\n  - Example: Errors in Step 7, Step 10, Step 14, Step 17, Step 19, Step 21, and Step 23 when trying to connect entities due to a mismatch in fluid requirements or blocked connection points.\n\n* Errors due to unconnected power networks:\n  - Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a power source.\n  - Example: Warnings in Step 7, Step 15, Step 19, Step 20, Step 21, Step 22, and Step 23 for various entities due to not being connected to a power network or not receiving electricity.\n\n* Errors due to undefined variables:\n  - Ensure that all variables used in the code are defined before they are used.\n  - Example: Error in Step 9 due to using an undefined variable 'to'.\n\n* Errors when getting an entity at a specific position:\n  - Ensure that an entity of the specified type exists at the given position.\n  - Example: Error in Step 12 when trying to get a chemical plant at (27.5, 40.5) that does not exist.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n* `place_entity(entity_type, position)`: Places an entity of the given type at the specified position. \n  - Failure modes: \n    - Attempting to place an entity at a position that is already occupied.\n    - Using an invalid or undefined entity type.\n  - Success mode: Entity is successfully placed at the specified position.\n\n* `set_entity_recipe(entity, recipe_name)`: Sets the recipe for the given entity.\n  - Failure modes: \n    - Using an invalid or undefined recipe name.\n  - Success mode: Recipe is successfully set for the entity.\n\n* `connect_entities(source_entity, target_entity, connection_type)`: Connects two entities using the specified connection type (e.g., pipes or power poles).\n  - Failure modes: \n    - Entities are not compatible for the specified connection type.\n    - Fluid output of the source entity does not match the fluid input required by the target entity.\n  - Success mode: Entities are successfully connected.\n\n* `get_entity(entity_type, position)`: Gets an entity of the given type at the specified position.\n  - Failure modes: \n    - No entity of the specified type exists at the given position.\n\nImportant variables:\n- `boiler_pos`: Position(x, y) of the boiler entity.\n- `steam_engine_pos`: Position(x, y) of the steam engine entity.\n- `oil_refinery`: Entity object representing the oil refinery.\n- `chemical_plant`: Entity object representing the chemical plant.\n- `chemical_plant_pos`: Position(x, y) of the chemical plant entity."}
