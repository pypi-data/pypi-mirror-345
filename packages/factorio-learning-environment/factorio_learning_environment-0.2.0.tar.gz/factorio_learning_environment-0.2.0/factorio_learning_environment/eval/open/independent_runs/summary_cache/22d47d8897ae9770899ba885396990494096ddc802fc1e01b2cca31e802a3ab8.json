{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around position 41.0, -82.0)\nComplex structure consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN, mining coal\n- Wooden chest (41.5, -80.5) for collecting coal\n- Output inserter (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Belt system with 2 transport belts:\n  - First belt (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Second belt (44.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Furnace inserter (45.5, -80.5) picking from belt and inserting into furnace\n- Stone furnace (47.0, -80.0)\n\nThe structure is set up as an automated coal mining and transport system, with coal being moved from mining drill through chest and belts to a furnace setup.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target location is clear of other objects\n- Common placement conflicts occurred with:\n  - Burner inserters at (44.0, -80.0), (45.5, -80.5)\n  - Transport belts at (44.5, -80.5)\n  - Furnaces being placed in incorrect positions\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- The output inserter is getting blocked due to full belts\n- Clear blocked belts at (43.5, -80.5) to maintain mining operations\n\n### Structure Optimization\n- Ensure proper spacing between components to avoid placement conflicts\n- Verify entity positions align with inserter pickup and drop positions\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- middle_belt: TransportBelt\n- output_belt: TransportBelt\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Mining drill, Belt system\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Output inserter\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Furnace inserter\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Furnace"}
