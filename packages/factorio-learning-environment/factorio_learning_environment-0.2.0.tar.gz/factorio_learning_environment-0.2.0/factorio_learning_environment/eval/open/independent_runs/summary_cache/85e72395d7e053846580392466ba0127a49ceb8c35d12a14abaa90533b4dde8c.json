{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), currently not connected with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), currently out of fuel.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), working status, supplying water.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting various entities, including positions (x=3.5, y=17.5) and (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at multiple positions including (x=20.5, y=19.5) and (x=3.5, y=20.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a fluid source. Check the connections and ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected to the boiler and offshore pump.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of the boiler and ensure it is refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected and there are no gaps in the piping system. Ensure the pipes are aligned properly to maintain fluid flow.\n\n### Offshore Pump Connection Issues\n- Ensure the offshore pump is correctly connected to the pipe network to supply water efficiently. Check for any disconnections or misalignments in the piping system."}
