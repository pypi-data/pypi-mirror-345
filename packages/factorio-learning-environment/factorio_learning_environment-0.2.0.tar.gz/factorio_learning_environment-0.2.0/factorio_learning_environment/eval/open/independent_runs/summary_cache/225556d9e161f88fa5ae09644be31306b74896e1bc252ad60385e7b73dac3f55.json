{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, fueled by coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of extracted materials.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring materials from the mining drill to the processing units.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled by coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-10.5, -46.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-8.5, -47.5) and (-14.5, -47.5) for transferring iron plates between storage chests and furnaces.\n\n### Additional Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) for additional smelting, currently lacking ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -45.5) for transferring materials to and from the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-10.5, -46.5) for storing processed materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing an entity is unoccupied before attempting to place the entity. This will prevent placement errors due to existing objects in the way.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities from a Distance\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 tiles; ensure you are within this range to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert or use them. This will prevent errors related to missing items, such as coal for refueling.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items to prevent them from idling. Check that the source containers are adequately stocked and that there are no blockages in the item flow.\n\n### Furnace Output Blockages\n- Regularly clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. This can be done by ensuring that there is adequate storage space available for the output items.\n\n### Storage Chest Full\n- Consider adding additional storage chests or expanding existing storage capacity to prevent blockages and optimize the flow of materials."}
