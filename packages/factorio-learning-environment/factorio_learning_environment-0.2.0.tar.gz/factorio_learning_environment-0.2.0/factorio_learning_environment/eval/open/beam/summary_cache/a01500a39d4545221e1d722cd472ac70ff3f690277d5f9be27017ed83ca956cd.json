{"content": "The error message indicates that there was an attempt to print information about the `steam_engine_entity`, but it wasn't defined at the time of execution. This suggests that the retrieval of the steam engine entity failed or was omitted, leading to a `NameError`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happened and how you can address it:\n\n1. **Entity Retrieval**:\n   - The offshore pump and boiler entities were successfully retrieved and printed.\n   - The error occurred when trying to print the steam engine entity, indicating it wasn't retrieved or defined.\n\n2. **Error Handling**:\n   - The error message suggests that the variable `steam_engine_entity` was not defined. This could be due to a failure in retrieving the entity or a typo in the variable name.\n\n3. **Diagnostic Steps**:\n   - Ensure that the `get_entities` function is correctly called for the steam engine and that it returns a valid list.\n   - Double-check that the `Prototype.SteamEngine` is correctly specified and that there are steam engines present in the game world.\n\n4. **Code Correction**:\n   - Add checks to ensure that each entity retrieval is successful before proceeding to use the entity. This can prevent `NameError` and similar issues.\n   - Use try-except blocks around entity retrievals to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.\n\nHere's a revised version of the code with added checks:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting diagnostic procedure...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Retrieve necessary entities\n    offshore_pump_entity = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    boiler_entity = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    steam_engine_entity = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    electric_pole_entity = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    assembling_machine_entity = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n\n    # Validate the presence of all critical entities\n    assert offshore_pump_entity, \"Offshore Pump not found!\"\n    assert boiler_entity, \"Boiler not found!\"\n    assert steam_engine_entity, \"Steam Engine not found!\"\n    assert electric_pole_entity, \"Electric Pole not found!\"\n    assert assembling_machine_entity, \"Assembling Machine not found!\"\n    print(\"All necessary entities found.\")\n\n    # Use first entity from each list\n    offshore_pump = offshore_pump_entity[0]\n    boiler = boiler_entity[0]\n    steam_engine = steam_engine_entity[0]\n    electric_pole = electric_pole_entity[0]\n    assembling_machine = assembling_machine_entity[0]\n\n    # Navigate to the boiler and inspect its fuel\n    move_to(boiler.position)\n    current_coal = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    print(f\"Current Boiler Coal Level: {current_coal}\")\n\n    # Refuel the boiler if necessary\n    if current_coal < 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, 10 - current_coal)\n        current_coal = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n        print(f\"Boiler refueled.
