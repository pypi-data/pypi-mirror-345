{"content": "# Factorio Factory Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position(16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(16.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest at position(17.5, -0.5) for coal storage\n- Burner inserter at position(18.5, -0.5) that takes items from outside and puts them into the chest\n- Burner inserter at position(17.5, 0.5) that takes coal from the chest but has no output destination\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position(16.0, 3.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(16.0, 3.0)\n- Wooden chest at position(17.5, 2.5) for coal storage\n\n### Water Pump System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- PipeGroup with water at position(-8.5, -0.5) connected to the offshore pump\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position(-9.5, -4.0) with UP orientation\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, -3.5)\n- PipeGroup at position(-8.5, -5.5) connecting the boiler\n- Second offshore pump at position(-9.5, 1.5) (not connected to the system)\n- Empty PipeGroup at position(-6.5, 5.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting fluid entities\n- When connecting offshore pumps to boilers, ensure they are close enough to each other. The maximum distance for direct connection is limited.\n- Boilers have specific connection points (fluid inputs and outputs) that must align with the pipes or other fluid entities.\n- Check the orientation of the boiler - it affects where the connection points are located.\n- When placing fluid entities, ensure there is a clear path for pipes to connect them.\n\n### Errors when placing entities near existing structures\n- Check for existing pipes or other entities before placing new structures.\n- When using place_entity_next_to(), increase the spacing parameter if placement fails due to existing entities.\n- Consider different directions when the default placement direction is blocked.\n- Use the entity's connection_points property to understand where it can connect to other entities.\n\n### Errors with entity placement on invalid terrain\n- Some entities cannot be placed on water or other specific terrain types.\n- Check nearby entities that might be blocking placement and adjust positioning accordingly.\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a chest as a source. You need to add an inserter that takes items from the chest and use the inserter as a source entity.\n- When connecting entities with transport belts, ensure there are no obstacles in the path and the distance is reasonable.\n\n### Errors with fluid connections\n- When connecting fluid-carrying entities (like boilers and steam engines), ensure they are properly aligned and positioned to allow valid connections.\n- Steam engines must be placed in the correct orientation relative to boilers to receive steam.\n- Check that connection points between fluid entities are not blocked by other structures.\n- Use connect_entities() only when entities are close enough to be connected with a reasonable number of pipes."}
