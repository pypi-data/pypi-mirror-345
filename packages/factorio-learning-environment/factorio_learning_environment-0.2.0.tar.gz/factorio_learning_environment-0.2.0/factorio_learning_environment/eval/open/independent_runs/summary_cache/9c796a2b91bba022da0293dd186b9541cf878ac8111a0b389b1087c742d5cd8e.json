{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0) with warnings of being out of fuel.\n- Steam engine at position (-59.5, -111.5) not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n- Offshore pump at position (-68.5, -95.5) working and supplying water.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with warnings of being out of fuel and a full chest.\n- Iron chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) containing iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel and full output of iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting various positions, primarily around the electricity generator and other areas, with some pipes containing water and others empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity group with poles connecting various positions, but some entities are not receiving power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities like boilers and furnaces. This will prevent errors related to inserting fuel when none is available.\n\n### Errors in Power Connection\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the electricity network. This includes ensuring that poles are placed correctly to provide power to inserters and other electrical entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Output\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces and other production entities to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source and that their pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the intended entities."}
