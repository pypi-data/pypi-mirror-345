Check the status of electric poles and ensure they are properly connected.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure inserters have access to source items. Check the inventory of connected chests or belts to ensure they contain the necessary items.\n\n### Assembling Machine Ingredient Shortage\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has all required ingredients available. Verify the supply chain leading to the machine, such as belts and inserters, to ensure they are functioning and stocked with the necessary materials.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Check the supply chain feeding into the furnace to ensure it is operational and stocked."}
