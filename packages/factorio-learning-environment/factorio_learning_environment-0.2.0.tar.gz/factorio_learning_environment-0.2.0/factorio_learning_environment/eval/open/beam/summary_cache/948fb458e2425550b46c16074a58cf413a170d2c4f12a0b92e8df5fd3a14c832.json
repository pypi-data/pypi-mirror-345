{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Furnace 2** at position (-12.0, -50.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill 1** at position (-19.0, -54.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill 2** at position (-16.0, -54.0)\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (-18.5, -51.5) (transfers ore from Drill 1 to Furnace 1)\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (-14.5, -53.5) (transfers ore from Drill 2 to Furnace 2)\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (-14.5, -48.5) (transfers plates to chest)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -51.5) (output storage for iron plates)\n\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and store the plates in a chest. However, the furnaces are currently idle due to a lack of iron ore, and the mining drills are blocked due to full output buffers.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to craft without sufficient ingredients\n- Ensure you have all required ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft. For example:\n  - Crafting a **Burner Mining Drill** requires **3 iron plates**, **3 iron gear wheels**, and **1 stone furnace**.\n  - Crafting **Iron Gear Wheels** requires **2 iron plates** per gear wheel.\n  - Crafting a **Wooden Chest** requires **2 wood**, which must be harvested first.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example:\n  - Attempting to place a **Burner Mining Drill** or **Wooden Chest** without having the required item in your inventory will fail.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example:\n  - Inserting **coal** into inserters or furnaces requires having coal in your inventory.\n\n#### Errors when referencing undefined variables\n- Double-check variable names before using them. For example:\n  - Referencing `chest_inserter` without defining it caused a `NameError`. Ensure all variables are properly initialized before use.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without sufficient ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel (coal) and raw materials (iron ore) to operate. For example:\n  - Furnaces will remain idle if they lack either fuel or iron ore.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are blocked\n- Mining drills will stop working if their output is full. Ensure there is a valid destination (e.g., a furnace or chest) to unblock them. For example:\n  - Place inserters or chests to transfer items from the mining drills to their destinations.\n\n#### Errors when inserters run out of fuel\n- Ensure inserters have sufficient fuel (coal) to operate. For example:\n  - Inserters will stop working if they run out of fuel, blocking the entire production chain."}
