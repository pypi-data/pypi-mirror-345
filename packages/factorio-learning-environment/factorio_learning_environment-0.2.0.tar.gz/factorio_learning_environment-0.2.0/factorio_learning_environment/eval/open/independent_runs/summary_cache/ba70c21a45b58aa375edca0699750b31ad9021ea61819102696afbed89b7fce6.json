{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at the drop position.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory of 27 coal, currently producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory of 48 coal, currently producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory of 50 coal, currently not producing due to full fuel source and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), (x=4.5, y=-58.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-50.5). These chests are used for storing various resources and items.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel the burner mining drill. Consider automating coal supply to prevent frequent manual refueling.\n\n### Full Chest at Drop Position\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) to allow the burner mining drill to continue mining operations.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that there are sufficient raw materials (e.g., iron ore) available in the furnace source inventory to maintain continuous production of iron plates.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_plate_inventory`: int = 6284\n  - `iron_gear_wheel_inventory`: int = 4\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: int = 3\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the current structures and common errors encountered, along with actionable tips for improvement."}
