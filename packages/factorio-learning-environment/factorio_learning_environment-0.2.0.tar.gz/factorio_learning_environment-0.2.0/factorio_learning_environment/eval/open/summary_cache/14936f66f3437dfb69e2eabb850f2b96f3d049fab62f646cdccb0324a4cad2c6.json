{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal (27 units) but output blocked due to no sink entity accepting output  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal (42 units), currently full on source inventory (iron ore) and output inventory (iron plates)  \n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from mining drill to furnace, fueled with coal (49 units), waiting due to blocked furnace belt at drop position  \n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from assembling machine, fueled with coal (49 units), waiting for source items  \n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into assembling machine, out of fuel and waiting for source items  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, not receiving electricity and lacking iron plates (needs 2)  \n- Small electric poles at positions (21.5, 75.5), (18.5, 72.5), and (18.5, 75.5) providing electricity connections, but assembler still has no power  \n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, the assembling machine is not powered and inserters are running out of fuel, causing production halts and blocked outputs.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power  \n- Despite electric poles being placed and connected, the assembling machine remains without power.  \n- Verify that electric poles form a continuous power network including the assembler and all inserters.  \n- Check that poles have sufficient coverage and are properly connected to the assembler\u2019s electrical connection points.  \n- Confirm that the power network is energized and poles have power supply.  \n\n### Errors due to burner inserters running out of fuel  \n- Burner inserters at positions (23.5, 73.5) and others run out of coal fuel, causing them to stop working and block production flow.  \n- Ensure a steady supply of coal fuel to all burner inserters to maintain operation.  \n- Implement a system to automatically insert coal into burner inserters or switch to electric inserters if power is available.  \n\n### Errors inserting coal into inserters failing due to no coal in inventory  \n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into burner inserters fail because the inventory lacks coal at the time of insertion.  \n- Always verify that the player inventory contains sufficient coal before attempting to insert fuel into entities.  \n- Harvest coal proactively or maintain a buffer stock in inventory to avoid fuel starvation.  \n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs and full inventories  \n- The burner mining drill output is blocked because there is no sink entity to accept its output, causing it to stop working.  \n- The stone furnace\u2019s source and output inventories are full, indicating downstream bottlenecks.  \n- Ensure inserters and chests downstream have capacity to accept items to prevent blocking.  \n- Clear inventories or increase storage capacity to maintain smooth flow.  \n\n### General placement and connection error tips (from previous report)  \n- Confirm target tiles are free before placing entities to avoid collisions.  \n- Use inserters between furnaces and belts rather than connecting belts directly to furnaces.  \n- Verify assembling machine recipes and power connections before starting production.  \n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
