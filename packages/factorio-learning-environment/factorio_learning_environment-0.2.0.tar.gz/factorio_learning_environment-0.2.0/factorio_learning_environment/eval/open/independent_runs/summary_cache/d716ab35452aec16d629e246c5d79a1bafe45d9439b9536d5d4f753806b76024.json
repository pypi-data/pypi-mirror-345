There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: Position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: [Ingredient(name='iron-ore', count=39998)]\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: No ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target location is unoccupied before attempting to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, Transport Belts, and Stone Furnaces. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- Verify the target location is suitable and unoccupied before moving entities like Stone Furnaces to avoid movement errors.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it with functions like `get_entity`. This will prevent errors related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Confirm that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities, such as inserting coal into a drill.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Make sure there is a valid sink entity to accept outputs from entities like the Burner Mining Drill to avoid warnings about blocked outputs."}
