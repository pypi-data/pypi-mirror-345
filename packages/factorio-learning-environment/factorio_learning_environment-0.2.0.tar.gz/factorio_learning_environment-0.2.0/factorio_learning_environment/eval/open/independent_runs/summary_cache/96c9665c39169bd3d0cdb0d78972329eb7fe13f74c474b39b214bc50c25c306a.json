{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with pipes at positions such as (-46.5, -122.5) and (-47.5, -122.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connecting the furnace at (6.0, -62.0) to a Wooden Chest at (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including the Steam Engine at (-40.5, -113.5) to the Lab at (6.5, -57.5) and Inserter at (6.5, -60.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions such as (-13.5, -97.5) and (-25.5, -71.5)\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs\n- Connected to the power network but currently not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and boiler. Double-check the positions and ensure there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors in Power Connection\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect power lines. Ensure that all poles are properly placed and connected to form a continuous power network.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Type in API Calls\n- When using functions like `insert_item`, ensure that the second argument is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Review the function documentation to use the correct parameters.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that the inserter is within the range of a powered electric pole. Check the power network connections and ensure all poles are connected and powered."}
