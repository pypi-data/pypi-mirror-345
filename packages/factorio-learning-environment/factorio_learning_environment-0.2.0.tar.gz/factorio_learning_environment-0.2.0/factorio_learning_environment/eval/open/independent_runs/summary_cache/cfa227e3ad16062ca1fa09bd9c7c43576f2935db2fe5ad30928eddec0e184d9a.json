{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). \n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipe (position -12.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe (position -13.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe (position -10.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe (position -11.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe (position -9.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe (position -13.5, 16.5)\n- Pipe (position -9.5, 16.5)\n- Pipe (position -13.5, 20.5)\n- Pipe (position -13.5, 21.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n\n### Lab at position(5, 5)\nConsists of a lab (position 5, 5).\n\n### Furnace at position(5, 5)\nConsists of a furnace (position 5, 5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to offshore pump\n- Ensure that the boiler and offshore pump are within the correct range for connection. Check the positions of both entities and ensure there are no obstacles or incorrect placements that prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
