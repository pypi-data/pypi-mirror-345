{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 3})\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the tile is unoccupied and valid before attempting to place entities like Burner Inserter, Transport Belt, Stone Furnace, or Wooden Chest.\n- Check for any obstructions or existing entities in the desired location to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available in the inventory before attempting to insert items into entities.\n- Regularly check inventory levels to prevent errors related to missing resources, such as coal for fueling drills.\n\n### Errors in code logic and naming\n- Verify variable names and ensure they are defined correctly to avoid `NameError`. Double-check spelling and ensure the correct variable is being referenced.\n- Review the code logic to ensure all conditions and operations are correctly implemented.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity or storage available to accept outputs from entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage warnings.\n- Regularly clear items from drop positions to maintain smooth operation and prevent output blockage."}
