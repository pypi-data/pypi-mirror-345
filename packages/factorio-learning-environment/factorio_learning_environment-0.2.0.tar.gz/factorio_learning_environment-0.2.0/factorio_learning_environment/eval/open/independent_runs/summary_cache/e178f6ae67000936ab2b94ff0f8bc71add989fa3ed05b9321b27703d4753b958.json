{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at Position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position(x=52.0, y=-79.0) (no ingredients to smelt)\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=53.5, y=-79.5) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=54.5, y=-79.5) (contains 336 iron plates)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) (out of fuel, chest at drop position is full)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=-14.5, y=-48.5) (empty)\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=-13.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=-12.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Storage Area at Position(x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=0.5, y=0.5) (contains transport belts, burner mining drills, stone furnaces, coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=1.5, y=0.5) (contains transport belts, stone furnaces, coal, and iron ore)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=2.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=3.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=4.5, y=0.5) (contains coal and iron ore)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=5.5, y=0.5) (contains iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels)\n\n#### Coal Storage and Transfer Setup at Position(x=41.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=41.5, y=-80.5) (empty)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=43.5, y=-80.5) (contains 39 coal)\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=42.5, y=-80.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining Drill Not Working\n- **Error**: The mining drill at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) is not working due to lack of fuel and a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Tip**: Ensure the mining drill has sufficient fuel and that the chest at the drop position is not full. Empty the chest or provide additional storage to allow the drill to continue mining.\n\n#### Burner Inserter Out of Fuel\n- **Error**: The burner inserter at Position(x=53.5, y=-79.5) is out of fuel.\n- **Tip**: Provide coal or other fuel to the burner inserter to ensure it can continue operating.\n\n#### Furnace No Ingredients\n- **Error**: The stone furnace at Position(x=52.0, y=-79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Tip**: Ensure that the furnace is supplied with iron ore and fuel (coal) to continue smelting operations.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- **Error**: Several burner inserters are waiting for source items to transfer.\n- **Tip**: Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests, furnaces) have items available for the inserters to pick up and transfer.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **None defined yet**\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **None assigned yet**"}
