# Ghana Address Formatting Process Flow

This document explains the process flow for formatting addresses in Ghana using the PyAddress library, with concrete examples from our demonstration.

## Process Overview

When a user wants to format an address in Ghana, the following process occurs:

1. The user provides address components for a location in Ghana
2. The system uses templates from the GitHub integration
3. The address is normalized, processed, and formatted according to Ghana's conventions

## Demo Results

Our demonstration successfully formatted multiple Ghana addresses:

```
Location: Ghana Technology Hub
Components provided:
  house_number: 21
  road: Independence Avenue
  suburb: Ridge
  city: Accra
  postcode: GA-059-0782
  country_code: GH

Output:
21 Independence Avenue
Accra, GA-059-0782
```

## Detailed Process Flow

1. **Input Data Preparation**:
   - User provides a dictionary of address components
   - The country code "GH" identifies this as a Ghana address

2. **AddressFormatter Initialization**:
   - `formatter = AddressFormatter()`
   - During initialization, the system loads templates from the processed GitHub repository data

3. **Input Processing**:
   - The user's input address components are fed into the formatter:
   ```python
   formatted = format_address(ghana_address)
   ```

4. **Core Processing Pipeline**:

   a. **Normalization**:
      - The normalizer standardizes component names
      - Components like "postcode" are recognized and normalized
      - The country code "GH" is recognized as Ghana

   b. **Plugin Processing**:
      - Various plugins process the address components
      - If enabled, the AddCountryPlugin would add "Ghana" to the output
      - Other plugins may transform or enhance the data

   c. **Template Selection**:
      - The system identifies this as a Ghana address based on country_code
      - It retrieves the Ghana template from the processed GitHub templates
      - If no specific Ghana template exists, it falls back to a default template

   d. **Template Application**:
      - The template determines the component order for Ghana
      - Components are inserted into the template placeholders
      - For Ghana, this appears to follow the pattern:
        ```
        {house_number} {road}
        {city}, {postcode}
        ```

5. **Output Generation**:
   - The system returns the formatted address
   - Format follows Ghana addressing conventions:
     ```
     21 Independence Avenue
     Accra, GA-059-0782
     ```

## Template Source

The templates for Ghana addresses are sourced from the OpenCageData address-formatting GitHub repository. This repository provides templates for over 200 countries worldwide, including Ghana.

During the PyAddress library's installation or setup:
1. The GitHub repository is included as a Git submodule
2. YAML templates are processed into JSON format
3. Templates are stored for efficient access

## Conclusion

The Ghana address formatting follows a clear process flow that leverages GitHub integration for template management. This ensures addresses are formatted according to local conventions without requiring manual template creation or maintenance.

As demonstrated, the system successfully formats addresses in Ghana with different combinations of components. The GitHub integration provides a robust, standardized approach to international address formatting that can be applied to addresses from around the world.
