{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity but is currently not fully operational due to connection issues. It consists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe groups connecting these components at positions (-5.5, 16.5) and (-8.5, 23.5)\n- Small Electric Poles placed at positions (-7.5, 17.5), (-0.5, 17.5), and (-0.5, 19.5) to distribute electricity\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors Between Components\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly placed and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that there are no gaps or incorrect placements that could prevent the flow of resources.\n\n### Fuel Management for Boiler\n- Regularly check and ensure that the boiler has sufficient fuel (coal) to operate. This can be done by monitoring the fuel level and refilling it when necessary.\n\n### Electrical Network Issues\n- Ensure that all electrical components are properly connected to the electric network. Verify the placement of electric poles and ensure they are within range to connect the necessary components.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of inventory items, especially critical components like pipes and electric poles, to avoid running out during construction or connection tasks.\n\n### Error Handling in Code\n- Review and handle exceptions such as \"IndexError\" when accessing lists or arrays to prevent runtime errors and ensure smooth operation of scripts.\n\n### Crafting and Resource Gathering\n- Ensure that you have enough resources to craft necessary items like pipes and electric poles before attempting to place or connect them."}
