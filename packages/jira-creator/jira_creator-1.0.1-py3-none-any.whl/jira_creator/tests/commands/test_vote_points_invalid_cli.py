This file contains a function test_vote_story_points_value_error to test a scenario where a ValueError is raised when
voting for story points. The function takes two arguments:
1. cli: An instance of the command-line interface.
2. capsys: A pytest fixture to capture stdout and stderr output.

Within the function, an inner class Args is defined with attributes issue_key and points, representing the issue key
and non-integer points to be voted on, respectively.

The function tests the system's behavior when a non-integer value is provided for story points during the voting
process.
