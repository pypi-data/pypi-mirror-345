{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with fuel inventory containing coal, status: WORKING\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with fuel inventory containing coal, status: WORKING\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory containing coal, status: WORKING\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with no fuel, status: NO_FUEL, warnings: 'out of fuel', 'no ingredients to smelt'\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storing items, status: NORMAL\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have sufficient items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. For instance, attempting to insert coal into a furnace failed due to insufficient coal in inventory.\n\n### Errors when Furnace is Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in furnaces to ensure continuous operation. The copper furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) is out of fuel, leading to a halt in production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item is available in the inventory before invoking this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity, used in operations involving fuel and smelting.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity, used in operations involving fuel and smelting."}
