{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) intended to move items from a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) intended to move items to the furnace.\n\n### Belt Conveyor System\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-26.5, -65.5) to (-22.5, -65.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-23.5, -64.5) to (-21.5, -64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-20.5, -64.5) to (-20.5, -66.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-15.5, -63.5) to (-15.5, -65.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5).\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inserter Blockage Errors\n- Ensure that there is a destination entity with available space for the inserter to deposit items. Check that the path is clear and there are no items blocking the output.\n\n### Furnace Input Connection Errors\n- Verify that all input connections to furnaces are correctly set up and that the necessary ingredients are supplied to the furnace. Ensure that belts and inserters are properly aligned and functioning.\n\n### Fuel Shortages in Mining Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel, which halts resource extraction.\n\n### Inserter Source Item Errors\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter has the necessary items available for pickup. Check that the inserter is correctly aligned with the source entity."}
