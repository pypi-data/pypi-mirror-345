{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest and other entities.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the transport belt.\n- Transport Belt at position (-12.5, -55.5) for moving iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) transferring iron ore to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring iron plates to the chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Ensure that the transport system is correctly set up to deliver iron ore to the furnace. Check the connectivity and direction of transport belts and inserters.\n\n### Pickup Entity Errors\n- Verify the exact position of the entity you intend to interact with. Ensure that the entity exists at the specified location before attempting to pick it up.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Make sure there is a valid sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the mining drill. Clear any items blocking the output path.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity, like a chest or belt, has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the connectivity and flow of items in the system."}
