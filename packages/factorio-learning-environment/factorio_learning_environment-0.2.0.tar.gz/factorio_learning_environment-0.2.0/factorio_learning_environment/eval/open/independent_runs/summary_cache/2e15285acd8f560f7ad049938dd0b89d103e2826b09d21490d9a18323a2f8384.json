{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) supplying coal to two Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a source of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore and connected to a series of transport belts and chests.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the storage chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt network facilitating the movement of iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Iron Ore and Plate Storage at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity to confirm it contains the necessary items.\n\n### Errors with Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner mining drills and ensure they are refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Verify that the furnace has a consistent supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to process into finished goods. Ensure that transport belts or inserters are correctly positioned to deliver materials to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Consider adding more storage or using inserters to transfer items to other locations."}
