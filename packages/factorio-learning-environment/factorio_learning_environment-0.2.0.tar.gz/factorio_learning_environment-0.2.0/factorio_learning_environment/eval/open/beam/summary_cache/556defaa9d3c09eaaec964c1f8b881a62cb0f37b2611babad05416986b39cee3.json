{"content": "Ah, I see the issue. We need to move to the position before we can place entities. Let's correct this:\n\n```python\n# First move to where we want to place furnaces\ntarget_pos = Position(x=-15.5, y=-11.5)\nmove_to(target_pos)\n\n# Now place first furnace near us\nfurnace1 = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace1, quantity=25)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace1, quantity=25)\n\n# Place second furnace next to first one\nfurnace2 = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    reference_position=furnace1.position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace2, quantity=25)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace2, quantity=25)\n\n# Let the furnaces work for a bit\nsleep(5)\n\n# Check our setup\nprint(f\"Furnaces placed and operating. Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on map: {get_entities()}\")\n\n\"\"\"\nLessons learned:\n1. Must move to a position before placing entities (max distance is 10 units)\n2. Use move_to() before place_entity()\n3. Can't place entities at arbitrary positions without being nearby\n4. Better to place entities relative to player position or other entities\n\"\"\"\n```", "summary_range": "[1-16]"}
