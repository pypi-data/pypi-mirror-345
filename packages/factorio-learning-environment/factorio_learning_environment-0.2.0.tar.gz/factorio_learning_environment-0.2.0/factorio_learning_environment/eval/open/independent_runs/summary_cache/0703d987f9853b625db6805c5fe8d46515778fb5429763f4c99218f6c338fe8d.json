{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nThe lab is currently not engaged in any research.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nThe assembling machine is set to produce automation science packs but is not receiving electricity and lacks the necessary resources (copper plate and iron gear wheel).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to furnace fuel\n- Ensure to have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. Check your inventory for available resources.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to assembling machine resources\n- Verify that you have all the required ingredients (copper plate and iron gear wheel) in your inventory before setting the recipe in the assembling machine."}
