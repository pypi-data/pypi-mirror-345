The steam engine is connected to the nearest electric pole.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-21.5, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -21.5, -73.0) and a furnace at position (5.0, -73.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine (not specified in logs).\n- Beltgroup (position not specified) that connects the furnace at position (5.0, -73.0) to the assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to access entities that do not exist\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access is present at the specified position. For example, the error regarding the stone furnace at position (-21.5, -73.0) indicates that no such entity exists there.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. The error regarding inserting coal into the working furnace indicates that there was no coal available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
