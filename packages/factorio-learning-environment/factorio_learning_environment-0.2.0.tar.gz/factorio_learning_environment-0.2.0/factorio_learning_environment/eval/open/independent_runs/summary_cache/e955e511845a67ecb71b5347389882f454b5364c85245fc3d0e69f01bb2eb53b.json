{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex (around x=-10 to x=7, y=-61 to y=3)\nComplex structure consisting of:\n1. Mining Area (y=-61 to y=-57):\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (-28,-61), (-10,-59), (-8,-59), (-6,-59)\n- Multiple wooden chests at (-9.5,-57.5), (-7.5,-57.5), (-5.5,-57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters coordinating material movement\n- Transport belt system connecting the mining drills\n\n2. Smelting Area (y=-59 to y=0):\n- Multiple stone furnaces at (-27,-59), (-23,-58), (-21,-58)\n- Burner inserters for material movement at (-25.5,-58.5), (-22.5,-56.5)\n- Storage chest at (-24.5,-58.5) containing processed materials\n\n3. Secondary Smelting Array (y=0 to y=3):\n- Four stone furnaces at (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), (6,0)\n- Input wooden chests at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), (6.5,2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters coordinating input/output\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure there is a valid path between the start and end positions when connecting belts\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests, use inserters as intermediaries\n- When creating stepped connections, verify the path is properly normalized and doesn't have impossible angles\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Check if target position is clear before placing entities\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to allow for belt connections\n- Consider the direction and orientation of entities when placing them in a production line\n\n### Material flow errors\n- Some inserters are waiting for source items - ensure proper supply chain connectivity\n- Some inserters have blocked outputs - verify there are valid destination entities\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" - check if input logistics are working correctly\n\n### Fuel management\n- Some mining drills are out of fuel - implement better fuel distribution system\n- Keep monitoring fuel levels in burner inserters and mining drills"}
