{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, with key pipe positions at (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 21.5), and (-7.5, 25.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) for moving materials\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage\n- Small Electric Pole at position (17.5, -0.5) for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes and underground pipe ends is clear and properly aligned with existing connections to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Connection Issues with Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Verify that the boiler and steam engine are correctly connected to the fluid system to ensure they receive the necessary input liquid. Check all pipe connections and ensure there are no gaps.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are within range of an active power source. Check the connections of electric poles and ensure they are supplying power to the inserters.\n\n### Clearing Obstructions\n- Before placing new pipes, remove any obstructing pipes in the target area to prevent placement errors."}
