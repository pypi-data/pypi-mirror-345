{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to extract iron ore and process it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities at a Distance\n- Ensure you are within the maximum allowed distance (10 units) from the target position before placing entities. Move closer to the target position to place the entity successfully.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (chest) to the destination (furnace). Ensure the inserter is properly fueled and operational.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and replenish the fuel supply for all entities that require it, such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces, to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly extract excess resources to free up space.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to function. Check the inserter setup and fuel supply to resolve any issues with ingredient delivery to the furnace."}
