{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED due to no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status NO_FUEL, connected to various pipes and containing water at 15\u00b0C.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING, supplying water to the pipe network.\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler, ensuring water supply.\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the Boiler to the Steam Engine, intended for steam transfer.\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles distributed across various positions, currently with 0 voltage.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors Related to Fluid Connections\n- Ensure all fluid connections are properly established between the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes that could prevent fluid flow.\n\n#### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the Boiler to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of fuel is available and automate the refueling process if possible.\n\n#### Errors with Electrical Connections\n- Verify that all electrical poles are correctly connected and that there is a power source supplying voltage to the network. Check for any disconnected poles or missing connections that could disrupt power distribution."}
