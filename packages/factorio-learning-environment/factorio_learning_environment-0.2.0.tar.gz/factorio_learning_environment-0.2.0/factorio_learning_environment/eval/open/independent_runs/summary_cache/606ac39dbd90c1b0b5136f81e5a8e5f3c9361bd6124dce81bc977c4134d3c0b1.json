{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\n- Consists of multiple wooden chests and iron chests located at various positions for storing and transferring iron plates.\n- Key positions include:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-2.5, -52.5) with a warning of being full, containing iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) containing a large quantity of iron plates.\n  - Additional wooden chests at positions such as (-14.5, -54.5), (-15.5, -54.5), and (-9.5, -50.5) also storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- Includes a burner mining drill and several stone furnaces for processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Mining Drill:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0), currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5).\n- Stone Furnaces:\n  - Positioned at (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0), all with warnings of no ingredients to smelt and one indicating the furnace result is full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining and production halts. The burner mining drill at (4.0, -60.0) cannot continue due to a full chest at (4.5, -58.5).\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. The burner mining drill at (4.0, -60.0) is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure a consistent supply of raw materials to furnaces to avoid production stoppages. Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) are currently without ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- No specific utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- Inventory: `{'wooden-chest': 9, 'wood': 6, 'iron-ore': 380, 'iron-plate': 5700, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}`"}
