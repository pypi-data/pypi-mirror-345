Currently, several furnaces report 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n- Monitor the output inventory of the furnaces to avoid situations where the furnace result is full, which can prevent further smelting.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
