{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (19.5, -3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions such as (19.5, -3.5), (19.5, -2.5), (20.5, -3.5), (22.5, -4.5), and others.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) for additional copper plate production.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Fluid Transport System\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -12.5) with pipes extending to various positions, currently empty.\n- PipeGroup at Position (4.5, -9.5) transporting water from an offshore pump, status full output.\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -3.5) transporting water to the electricity generator, status full output.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions such as (24.5, -7.5), (-3.5, 2.5), and others, forming an electricity network with ID 4966.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at Position (unknown), currently missing science packs for research.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) for transferring items, currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a tile before attempting placement. Avoid placing entities where there is an existing object, as this will block the placement.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Ensure the entity type and position are correct to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Connections\n- Ensure all fluid connections are properly established and that there are no missing or disconnected pipes in the network to maintain fluid flow.\n\n### Errors in Power Connections\n- Ensure that all inserters and other powered entities are connected to a working electricity network to avoid power-related warnings and inefficiencies."}
