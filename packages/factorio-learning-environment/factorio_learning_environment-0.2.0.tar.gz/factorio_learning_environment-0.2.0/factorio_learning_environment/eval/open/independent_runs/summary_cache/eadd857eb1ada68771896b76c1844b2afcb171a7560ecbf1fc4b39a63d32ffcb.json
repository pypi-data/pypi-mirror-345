In this case, the steam engine was not connected due to placement blockage.\n\n### Errors when attempting to retrieve entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to get exists at the specified position. The error indicates that there was no boiler found at the specified position (-21.5, 28.0).\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
