{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the ground and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (chest) to the destination (furnace). Frequent repositioning indicates misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as the burner mining drill, burner inserter, and stone furnace to maintain continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt the production process.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Monitor the inventory levels of the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can stop the mining drill from operating. Regularly extract items from the chest to free up space.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Check the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving items.\n\n### Errors in Resource Availability\n- Keep track of the available resources, such as iron ore, to avoid running out, which can cause the furnace to stop working due to a lack of ingredients."}
