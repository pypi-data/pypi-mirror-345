The agent made repeated attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to research, but none of these attempts completed successfully due to inventory shortages and missing ingredients. \n\n\u2022 In support of resource processing, the agent made use of existing smelting facilities:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Used to convert iron ore and coal into additional iron plates.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Used to smelt copper ore (with coal) into copper plates for later copper cable production.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage Errors\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \"radius\") or extra positional arguments to get_entities().
