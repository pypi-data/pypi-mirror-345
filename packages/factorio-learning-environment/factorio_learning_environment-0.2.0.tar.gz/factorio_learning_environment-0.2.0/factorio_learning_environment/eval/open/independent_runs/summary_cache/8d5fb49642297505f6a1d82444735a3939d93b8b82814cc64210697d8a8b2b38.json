{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel and currently extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that serves as the drop-off point for the mined iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) that stores iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that smelts iron ore into iron plates, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to undefined variables**: The agent encountered a `NameError` indicating that 'Inventory' is not defined. To avoid this, ensure that all necessary classes and variables are correctly imported or defined before use.\n  \n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: Ensure that the target tile is free before attempting to place a new entity. This can prevent placement errors.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**: Move to the target entity before attempting to extract items to avoid distance-related errors.\n\n- **Warnings about full chests**: The agent received a warning that the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Regularly check and empty chests to maintain a smooth operation of mining drills.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Defined Functions**: \n  - `inserted_ore`: This function is expected to handle ore insertion but failed due to an undefined variable.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Inventory type, stores items such as wood and iron ore.\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Entity type, represents the mining drill.\n  - `wooden_chest`: Entity type, represents the wooden chest.\n  - `stone_furnace`: Entity type, represents the stone furnace."}
