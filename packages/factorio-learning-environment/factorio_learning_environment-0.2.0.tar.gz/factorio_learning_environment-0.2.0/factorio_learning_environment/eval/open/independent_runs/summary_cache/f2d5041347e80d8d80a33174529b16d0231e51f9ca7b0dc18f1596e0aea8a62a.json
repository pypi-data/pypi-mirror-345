{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-9, 24)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler (position -23.5, 28.5)\n- Boiler (position -19.5, 28.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of offshore pump\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is correctly placed and operational before attempting to inspect its inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes overlapping with water\n- Avoid placing pipes in locations where their footprint overlaps with water. Check the surrounding area before placing pipes to ensure there are no conflicts.\n\n### Errors when connecting boilers\n- Ensure that all connection points are properly aligned and that the boilers are connected to a valid fluid source to avoid the status of NOT_CONNECTED."}
