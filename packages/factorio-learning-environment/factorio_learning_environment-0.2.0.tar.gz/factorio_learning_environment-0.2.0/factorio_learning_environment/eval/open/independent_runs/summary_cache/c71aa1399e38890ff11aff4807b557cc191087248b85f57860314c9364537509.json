{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) which is currently fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Storage Facility at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing items.\n\n### Inserter Setup at Position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) intended to feed resources into the furnace at position (0.0, 0.0). Now operational with power connection.\n- Small Electric Pole at position (2.5, 1.5) providing power to the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, before placing a stone furnace, make sure it exists in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without having the required raw resources\n- Before attempting to craft an item, ensure you have all the necessary raw resources. For example, to craft a wooden chest, you need wood, which must be gathered as it is a raw resource and not craftable.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. For instance, avoid placing a small electric pole at (2.5, 0.5) if there is an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors when crafting items that require intermediate products\n- When crafting complex items, ensure you have all the necessary intermediate products. For instance, crafting an inserter requires electronic circuits, which in turn require copper cables and copper plates. Copper plates need to be smelted in a furnace. Ensure you have the necessary infrastructure and resources to produce these intermediate products before crafting the final item.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient smelting of copper plates\n- Ensure that copper ore is being processed in a furnace to produce copper plates before attempting to use them. If you encounter an assertion error regarding unsmelted copper plates, check that the furnace is operational and has the necessary copper ore and fuel.\n\n### Errors when inserting items not present in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into a furnace or any other entity, verify that you have the required items in your inventory. For example, ensure copper ore is available in your inventory before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with incorrect attributes\n- When connecting entities, ensure that all involved entities have the necessary attributes. For example, ensure that the entities have defined tile dimensions and are correctly positioned before attempting to connect them with transport belts or other connectors.\n\n### Errors when locating entities on the map\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to interact with are present on the map. For example, when trying to find the nearest small electric pole, make sure it has been placed on the map.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in unsuitable locations\n- Verify that the location where you intend to place an entity is suitable and unoccupied. For example, ensure there is no existing object at the target location before placing a small electric pole.\n\n### Errors when finding entities that do not exist\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to find or interact with exist on the map. For example, attempting to locate a steam engine that has not been placed will result in an error. Make sure the entity is placed and available on the map before attempting to interact with it."}
