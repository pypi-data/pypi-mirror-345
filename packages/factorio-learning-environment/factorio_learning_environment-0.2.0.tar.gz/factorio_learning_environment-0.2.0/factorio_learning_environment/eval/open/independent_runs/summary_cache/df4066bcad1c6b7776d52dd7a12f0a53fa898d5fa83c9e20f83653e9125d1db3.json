{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore and dropping it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure you maintain a sufficient inventory of coal to refuel all necessary entities, such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces, to avoid production halts.\n\n### Furnace Production Issues\n- Verify that the furnace has both fuel and iron ore to process. Frequent checks can prevent the furnace from running without producing iron plates.\n\n### Chest Overcapacity\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage.\n\n### Inserter Alignment\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring materials between entities."}
