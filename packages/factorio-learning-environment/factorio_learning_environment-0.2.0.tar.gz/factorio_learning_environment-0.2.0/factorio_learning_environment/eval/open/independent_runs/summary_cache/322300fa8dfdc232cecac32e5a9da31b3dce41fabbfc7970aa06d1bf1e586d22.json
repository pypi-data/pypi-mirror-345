{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items between entities.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) moving items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -48.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the storage chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for temporary storage of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -45.5) waiting to transfer items to the next stage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### UnboundLocalError: Cannot Access Local Variable 'x'\n- Ensure that all local variables are properly initialized before use. This error occurs when attempting to access a variable that hasn't been assigned a value.\n\n### Errors with Missing or Undefined Entities\n- Verify that all entities referenced in the code are correctly defined and exist in the game world. This includes ensuring that entity names are spelled correctly and that the entities are placed at the expected positions.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for an inserter has items available for transfer. This can be resolved by checking the inventory of the source entity and ensuring it is not empty.\n\n### No Iron Ore Available in Ore Chest for Transfer\n- Regularly check the availability of resources in storage chests to ensure that there is a sufficient supply for ongoing operations. Consider setting up alerts or monitoring systems to track resource levels.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items\n- Ensure that you are within the correct proximity to the target entity when attempting to extract items. This can prevent errors related to being too far from the entity you are interacting with."}
