The error \"attempt to index field ? (a nil value)\" indicates that one or more of the entities involved in the connection process might not exist or are incorrectly referenced.\n\n### Errors when using inserters without source items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items to pick up. The warning \"inserter waiting for source items\" suggests that the inserter is not receiving items from the expected source. Verify the connectivity and item flow to the inserter.\n\n### Furnace warnings\n- Address the warnings in furnaces such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\" by ensuring that the furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials and that their output is being cleared regularly to prevent backlog."}
