{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n-  Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n-  Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is currently out of fuel and has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5).\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n-  Stone furnace (position -15, -50) with a full inventory of coal and iron plates, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting items into a full inventory**\n  - Ensure that the target entity (e.g., furnace) has available space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. The stone furnace at position (-15, -50) is currently full and cannot accept more items.\n  \n- **Errors when extracting items**\n  - Ensure that the source entity (e.g., wooden chest) has enough items available for extraction before attempting to extract. The wooden chest may not have the required quantity of coal available for extraction.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `insert_item`: Insert items into a specified entity's inventory.\n    - **Failure Mode**: Fails when the target inventory is full.\n  - `extract_item`: Extract items from a specified entity's inventory.\n    - **Failure Mode**: Fails when there are not enough items in the source inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `current_inventory`: dict - Current inventory of the agent.\n  - `extracted_count`: int - Number of items extracted from the wooden chest.\n  - `furnace`: object - Reference to the stone furnace entity."}
