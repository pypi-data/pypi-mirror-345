{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity but is currently not operational due to connectivity issues. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-0.5, 25.5) with status `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED`.\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 25.0) with status `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED` and fueled by coal.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED`.\n- **Pipe Groups** connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, but with connectivity issues:\n  - PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-5.5, 21.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-4.5, 23.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (0.5, 16.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nThis facility is designed to produce iron plates but is currently facing operational issues. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (15.0, 0.0) with status `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`.\n- **Inserters** at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) with status `EntityStatus.NO_POWER`.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storing iron ore and other items.\n- **Small Electric Pole** at position (17.5, -0.5) intended to supply power to the inserters but currently not providing electricity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connectivity Issues with Electricity Generator\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to allow fluid flow.\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly positioned and connected to the water source.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Before placing pipes or underground pipes, ensure the target location is clear and suitable for placement to avoid obstruction errors.\n- Adjust the positioning of pipes to ensure they are connected properly to the intended fluid system.\n\n### Power Supply Issues\n- Ensure that all inserters and other electrical entities are within the range of a powered electric pole.\n- Verify that electric poles are connected to a power source and are functioning correctly to supply electricity.\n\n### Resource Supply for Production\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt, such as iron ore, to avoid `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`.\n- Regularly check and replenish resources in the production line to maintain continuous operation."}
