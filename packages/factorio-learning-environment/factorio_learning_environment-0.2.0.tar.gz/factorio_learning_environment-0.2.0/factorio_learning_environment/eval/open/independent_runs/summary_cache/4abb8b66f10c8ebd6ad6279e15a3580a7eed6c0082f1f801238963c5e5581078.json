{"content": "Here's the report based on the provided logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System (around x=41, y=-85)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-85.0) mining coal\n- Burner inserter (x=42.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal\n- Wooden chest (x=43.5, y=-83.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron System 1 (around x=-19, y=-53)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-20.0, y=-54.0) mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter (x=-19.5, y=-52.5) transferring ore\n- Stone furnace (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) for smelting iron plates\n\n### Iron System 2 (around x=-13, y=-55)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-14.0, y=-56.0) mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring ore\n- Stone furnace (x=-11.0, y=-54.0) for smelting iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Alignment Issues\n- When placing inserters, ensure they are exactly aligned with the drop position of mining drills\n- Keep proper spacing between entities to avoid collision issues\n- Consider the direction and orientation of entities when placing them\n- Check for existing entities or items-on-ground that might block placement\n- Verify the placement area is valid (not water or other unbuildable terrain)\n\n### System Configuration Issues\n- Ensure proper spacing between components in production lines\n- Verify that inserters' pickup and drop positions align with source and destination entities\n- When rebuilding systems, remove all old entities before placing new ones to avoid conflicts\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to(entity_type, reference_position, spacing, direction): Places an entity next to a reference position\n  - Success: When placement area is clear and valid\n  - Failure: When there are collisions or invalid placement areas\n\nImportant Variables:\n- drill_drop_position (Position): The position where mining drills output their resources\n- inserter_pickup_position (Position): The position where inserters collect items\n- inserter_drop_position (Position): The position where inserters place items"}
