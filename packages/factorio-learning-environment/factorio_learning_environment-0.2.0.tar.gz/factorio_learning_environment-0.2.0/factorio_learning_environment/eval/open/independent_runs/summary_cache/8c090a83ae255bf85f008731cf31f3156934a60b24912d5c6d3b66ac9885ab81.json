{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) did not result in a placed structure, and no other built structures have been reported.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Parameter Handling\n  - When invoking get_entities, use the proper parameter format. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or incorrect positional parameters that lead to TypeErrors.\n  \n\u2022 NoneType Safety\n  - Always verify that a function\u2019s return value is not None before iterating over it. Use a fallback (for example, an empty list) to prevent errors when operating on expected collections.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Verification\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab, confirm its availability in the inventory.\n  - Ensure all necessary sub-ingredients (for instance, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available to meet lab crafting requirements and avoid cascading resource errors.\n\n\u2022 Resource and Process Confirmation\n  - Verify that the prerequisite resource processing (such as smelting iron and copper plates) has completed successfully so that sufficient materials are available for crafting complex items like labs."}
