{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (17.5, 20.5) with energy 15000.0, connected to pipe-to-ground at Position (16.5, 17.5) and pipe at Position (17.5, 17.5).\n- Boiler at Position (1.5, 23.0) with fuel inventory containing 33 coal, connected to multiple pipes from Position (-0.5, 21.5) to Position (3.5, 21.5).\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5), connected to pipes at Position (-9.5, 23.5) and Position (-8.5, 23.5).\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup for steam with fluid system ID 9707, running from Position (3.5, 17.5) to Position (10.5, 21.5).\n- PipeGroup for water with fluid system ID 9718, running from Position (-9.5, 23.5) to Position (-0.5, 23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 18173, consisting of poles from Position (35.5, 24.5) to Position (33.5, 24.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### AttributeError: 'PipeGroup' object has no attribute 'fluid_system'\n- Ensure that the PipeGroup object is correctly initialized with a fluid_system attribute before accessing it. This error indicates that the code attempted to access a non-existent attribute, which can be mitigated by verifying the object's attributes before use.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the provided steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `pipe`: Type: `PipeGroup`, used in the context of accessing attributes.\n  - `boiler`: Type: `Boiler`, used in refueling operations.\n  - `inventory`: Type: `dict`, representing current inventory items and their quantities."}
