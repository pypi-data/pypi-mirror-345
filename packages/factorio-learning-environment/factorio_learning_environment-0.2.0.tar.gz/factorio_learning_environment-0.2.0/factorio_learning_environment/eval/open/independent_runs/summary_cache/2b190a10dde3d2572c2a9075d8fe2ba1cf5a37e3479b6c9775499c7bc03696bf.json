{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at (15.5, 70.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) facing DOWN (output at 15.5, 72.5)\n- Small electric pole at (13.5, 69.5) powering the drill\n- Stone furnace at (16.0, 74.0) facing UP\n- Wooden chest at (16.5, 74.5)\n- Transport belts connecting drill to furnace (positions: (15.5,72.5) to (24.5,70.5))\n\n### Remote iron smelting setup at (26.0, 71.0)\n- Stone furnace at (26.0, 71.0) facing LEFT\n- Transport belts connecting to main mining setup\n\n### Power generation setup at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) connected via pipes to:\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 3.5) (currently out of fuel)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5, 3.5) (not connected to power network)\n- Pipe network connecting offshore pump to boiler (positions: (-8.5,-0.5), (-6.5,-0.5), (-7.5,-0.5), (-4.5,-0.5), (-5.5,-0.5), (-3.5,-0.5))\n- Power pole at (3.5, 3.5) connecting the system\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement collision errors (repeated 8 times)\n- Verify target position is clear before placing entities (chests/inserters/furnaces)\n- Check for existing objects at target location before placement attempts\n- Avoid placing furnaces near water or other unplaceable terrain\n\n### Belt connection errors\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces - requires inserters as intermediaries\n- Plan belt routes before placement to avoid crossing existing structures\n\n### Inserter placement issues (3 occurrences)\n- Ensure proper spacing between furnaces and output chests for inserter placement\n- Verify inserter orientation matches input/output directions\n\n### Power system problems\n- Add fuel to boiler to enable steam generation\n- Verify power connections between steam engine and power poles\n- Check energy levels of connected machines after establishing connections\n\n### Smelting setup optimization\n- Place furnaces closer to mining drills to minimize belt requirements\n- Verify furnace orientation matches belt input/output directions\n- Ensure complete fuel supply chain before expecting smelting operations\n\n### Placement sequence planning\n- Survey area for obstacles before attempting placements\n- Plan complete mining/smelting setups before placement to avoid rework\n- Maintain proper spacing between connected production chain components"}
