Verify that the designated PipeGroup is operational and correctly configured for the target fluid system.\n\u2022 Fixed Delay Limitations for Pipeline Stabilization:\n   - Reliance on a fixed 10-second delay after connection attempts does not ensure pipeline network stabilization. Implement dynamic readiness checks to confirm stability before retrying connection operations."}
