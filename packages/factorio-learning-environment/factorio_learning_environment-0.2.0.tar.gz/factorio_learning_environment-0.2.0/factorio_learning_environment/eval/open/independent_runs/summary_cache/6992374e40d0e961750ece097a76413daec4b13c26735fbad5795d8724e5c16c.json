{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Used for storing extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at Positions (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-11.5, y=-46.5): Transfer items between entities, with some waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at Positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0): Smelt iron ore into iron plates. The furnace at (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) is currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at various positions for storing iron plates, including (x=-7.5, y=-48.5), (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-6.5, y=-49.5), (x=-4.5, y=-48.5), (x=-5.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-3.5, y=-48.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Item Insertion\n- Ensure that the target entity has space for the items being inserted. Check the inventory capacity before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors in Item Extraction\n- Verify that the target entity contains the items you wish to extract. Ensure the entity's inventory is not empty before extraction attempts.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Regularly check and clear any blockages at the inserter drop positions to maintain smooth operation. Ensure that the destination has space for items being transferred.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner entities to ensure continuous operation. Refuel entities before they run out of fuel to prevent downtime."}
