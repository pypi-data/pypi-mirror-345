Warnings indicate that the furnace result is full, which means no further processing can occur until items are removed.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required technology\n- Research the necessary technology (e.g., Automation technology) before attempting to craft items that require it. This will prevent errors related to crafting items that are not unlocked yet.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
