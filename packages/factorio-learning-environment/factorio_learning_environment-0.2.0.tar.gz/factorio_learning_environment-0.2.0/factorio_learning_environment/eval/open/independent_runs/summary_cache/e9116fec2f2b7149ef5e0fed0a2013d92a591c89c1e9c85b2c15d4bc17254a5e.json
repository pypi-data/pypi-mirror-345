{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring iron ore to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. Check your inventory levels to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors due to full storage entities\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full, which halts production processes.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Monitor the input inventory of furnaces to ensure they have the necessary ingredients for processing. Refill as needed to maintain continuous operation."}
