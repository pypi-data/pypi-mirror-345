{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (16.0, 74.0) for smelting iron ore to plates\n- Burner inserter at (16.5, 72.5) transferring items between drill and furnace\n- Wooden chest at (17.5, 74.5) for output storage\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at (-46.0, 71.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-46.0, 71.0) extracting copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-46.0, 73.0) for smelting copper ore to plates\n- Wooden chest at (-45.5, 74.5) for output storage\n\n### New Iron Ore Mining Facility at (30.0, 70.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (30.0, 70.0) facing DOWN\n- Stone furnace at (30.0, 73.0)\n- Input burner inserter at (30.5, 71.5) facing DOWN (connects drill to furnace)\n- Output burner inserter at (31.5, 73.5) facing LEFT (connects furnace to chest)\n- Wooden chest at (32.5, 73.5) for output storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement collision errors (recurring)\n- Check for existing entities at target positions before placing new entities\n- Increase spacing when placing entities next to each other to avoid collisions\n- Verify direction choices when placing entities relative to others\n\n### Distance placement errors (recurring)\n- Move closer to target position before placing entities (max placement distance is 10 tiles)\n- Verify player position relative to target placement position\n\n### Belt connection errors (new patterns)\n- Inserters cannot pick up directly from mining drills' output positions - use pickup_position instead\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces - always use inserters as intermediaries\n- Verify inserter directions match the required item flow direction before connecting\n\n### Inserter configuration issues (new)\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with source and destination entities\n- Verify inserter directions match the required item flow direction\n- Check that inserters have clear paths between pickup and drop locations\n\n### Entity placement validation (new)\n- Always verify entity status messages after placement to detect configuration issues\n- Check for warnings like \"output blocked\" or \"no ingredients\" to identify setup problems\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\nNo functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
