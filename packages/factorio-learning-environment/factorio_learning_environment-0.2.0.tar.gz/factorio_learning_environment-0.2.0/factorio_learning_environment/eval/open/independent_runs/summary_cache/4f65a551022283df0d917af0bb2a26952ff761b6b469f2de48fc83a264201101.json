{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED due to warnings: 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status NO_FUEL, connected to multiple pipes, with fluid box containing water.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING, supplying water to the fluid system.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Pipe Group** for fluid system 6699, starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), currently EMPTY.\n- **Pipe Group** for fluid system 6710, starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), currently FULL_OUTPUT with water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group** with poles distributed across positions such as (x=12.5, y=23.5), (x=24.5, y=22.5), and others, currently at voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to a fluid source. Check for proper pipe connections and ensure that the input liquid is present.\n\n### Boiler Fuel Issues\n- Make sure to supply fuel to the boiler to maintain its operation. Check fuel inventory and automate fuel supply if necessary.\n\n### Offshore Pump Connection\n- Verify that the offshore pump is properly connected to the pipe network to ensure water supply to the boiler.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Variables**: None assigned. \n\nThis report summarizes the current state of structures and provides guidance on resolving existing issues."}
