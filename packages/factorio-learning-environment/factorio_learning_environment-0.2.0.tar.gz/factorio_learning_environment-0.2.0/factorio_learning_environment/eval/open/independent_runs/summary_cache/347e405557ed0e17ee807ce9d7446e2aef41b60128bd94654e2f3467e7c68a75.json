{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation (Updated)  \n- **Burner mining drills** at positions (19.0, 71.0) and (22.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore (status: `WORKING` but with warnings: *output blocked by items on ground*).  \n- **Stone furnaces** at positions (16.0, 73.0) (`NO_INGREDIENTS`), (19.0, 73.0), and (22.0, 73.0) (both `WORKING` with iron ore input).  \n- **Output system**:  \n  - **Burner inserters** at (16.5, 74.5) (`WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`), (19.5, 74.5), and (22.5, 74.5) (both `WORKING`).  \n  - **Wooden chests** at (16.5, 75.5) (10 iron plates), (19.5, 75.5), and (22.5, 75.5) (both with 98 iron plates).  \n\n#### Power Generation Setup (Unchanged)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) with connected pipes.  \n- **Boiler** at (-7.0, 0.5) (`WORKING`).  \n- **Steam engine** still unplaced.  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Placement and Proximity Issues  \n- **Entity too far to place**: Repeated attempts to place burner drills (e.g., at (15.5, 70.5)) while player was at (0, 0). Move within 10 tiles before placement.  \n- **Blocked placement**: Burner inserter at (15.5, 72.5) failed due to existing objects. Verify tile occupancy.  \n\n#### Production Bottlenecks  \n- **Furnace warnings**:  \n  - Furnace at (16.0, 73.0) has `NO_INGREDIENTS` despite burner drills operating. Ensure drills drop ore onto belts/chests linked to furnaces.  \n  - Drills at (19.0, 71.0) and (22.0, 71.0) report *output blocked*. Place chests or belts to collect ore.  \n\n#### Inventory Management  \n- **Insertion failures**: Attempts to insert iron ore into furnaces failed due to empty inventory. Mine ore before insertion.  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Resolve warnings first**: Address blocked drill outputs and furnace input shortages to stabilize production.  \n- **Debug tools**: Use `debug` mode to inspect entity connections and item flow.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \nNo new functions or variables were defined.  \n\n---  \n**Key Updates**:  \n- Burner drills replaced electric drills but face output issues.  \n- Furnace at (16.0, 73.0) remains idle due to missing ore input.  \n- Throughput stable at 38 iron plates/minute but could improve with resolved warnings."}
