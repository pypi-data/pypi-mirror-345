{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) for coal storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) for coal storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) for coal storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory levels of the source entities regularly.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly check the output inventory of furnaces to ensure they are not full. If full, remove items to prevent production halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of various resources.\n- `entities`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities present on the map and their states."}
