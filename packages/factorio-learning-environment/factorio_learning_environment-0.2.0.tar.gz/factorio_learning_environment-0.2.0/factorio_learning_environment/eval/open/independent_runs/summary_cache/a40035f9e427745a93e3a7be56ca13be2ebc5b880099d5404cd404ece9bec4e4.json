{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (0, 0)\nConsists of steam engine (position (0, 0)), boiler (position (0, 1)), and offshore pump (position (0, 2))\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (1, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (1, 0)) and a furnace at position (1, 1)\n- Burner mining drill (position (1, 2)) and a furnace at position (1, 3)\n- Burner mining drill (position (1, 4)) and a furnace at position (1, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position (2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (2, 1) and inserter at position (2, 2) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position (2, 3)) that connects the furnace at position (1, 1) to the assembling machine at position (2, 1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting without enough resources\n- Ensure you have enough of the required ingredients before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting an iron gear wheel requires 2 iron plates, which must be available in your inventory or produced in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. \n\n### Errors related to crafting machines\n- Check that the required crafting machine or furnace is available and operational before attempting to craft items that depend on them."}
