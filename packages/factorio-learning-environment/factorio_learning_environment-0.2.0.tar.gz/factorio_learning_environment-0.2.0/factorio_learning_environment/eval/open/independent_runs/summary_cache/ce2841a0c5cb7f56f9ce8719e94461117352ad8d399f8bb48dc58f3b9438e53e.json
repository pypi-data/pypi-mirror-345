{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions such as (-47.5, -122.5), (-46.5, -122.5), (-45.5, -122.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Iron Plate Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the small electric poles and the stone furnace\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Lab with input of automation science pack, currently not powered\n- Multiple PipeGroups and ElectricityGroup present on the map, but not currently functional or connected to the main structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Check for obstructions or incorrect placements that may block the connection.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Not Functioning\n- Verify that the boiler has sufficient fuel and that the steam engine has input liquid. Ensure all connections are properly established and there are no blockages in the fluid system.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Make sure that the inserter is within the range of a powered electric pole. Check the connections and ensure that the electric network is properly established.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner mining drill to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full to prevent mining interruptions."}
