Gather or craft more pipes if necessary.\n- Verify that the connection path is clear and valid between the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before inserting items like coal into entities such as boilers, ensure that you have the required items in your inventory.\n- Craft or gather necessary items like small electric poles before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network\n- Ensure that the electricity group is properly connected to the electric network to avoid the NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK status.\n- Verify the placement and connection of electric poles to ensure they are within range and connected to the network.\n\n### Index Errors\n- When accessing lists or arrays, ensure that the index is within the valid range to avoid IndexError. Check the list size before accessing elements."}
