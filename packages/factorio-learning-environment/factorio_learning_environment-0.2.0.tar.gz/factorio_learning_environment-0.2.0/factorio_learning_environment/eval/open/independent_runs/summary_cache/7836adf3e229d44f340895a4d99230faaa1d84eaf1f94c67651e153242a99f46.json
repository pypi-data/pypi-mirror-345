{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Group at position (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup (id=195149) with poles at positions:\n  - (52.5, 49.5)\n  - (46.5, 51.5)\n  - (50.5, 51.5)\n  - (14.5, 35.5)\n  - (34.5, 34.5)\n  - (52.5, 35.5)\n\n### Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- OffshorePump (name='offshore-pump', position=(-9.5, 24.5), status=EntityStatus.WORKING)\n- Pipe (position=(-9.5, 23.5))\n- Pipe (position=(-9.5, 22.5))\n\n### Copper Plate Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (name='stone-furnace', position=(1.0, 1.0), status=EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Chest (name='wooden-chest', position=(3.5, 1.5), inventory={'iron-plate': 20})\n- Burner Inserter (name='burner-inserter', position=(8.5, 1.5), status=EntityStatus.NO_FUEL)\n- Furnace (name='stone-furnace', position=(10.0, 1.0), status=EntityStatus.NO_FUEL)\n- Chest (name='wooden-chest', position=(3.5, 3.5), inventory={'iron-plate': 50})\n- Chest (name='wooden-chest', position=(3.5, 5.5), inventory={})\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that is unplaceable (e.g., water). \n\n### Errors when trying to get entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to get (e.g., steam-engine) exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. If it does not exist, check for correct positioning or if the entity has been removed. \n\n### Repeated Errors\n- The agent has repeatedly encountered issues with placing electric poles at positions (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0) due to blocking entities. Ensure to remove any blocking entities before attempting to place new structures. \n\n### General Tips\n- Always check the map for existing entities and their positions before placing new structures to avoid conflicts."}
