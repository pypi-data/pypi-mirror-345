{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), fueled by coal, smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5), storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5), extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the burner inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) to another burner inserter at position (6.5, 0.5) using transport belts (positions: (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5)).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5), transferring iron plates from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5), collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. If a placement fails due to an existing entity, consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect them to a transport belt. Direct belt connections from chests are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, ensure you have enough wooden chests or the required raw materials like wood.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing raw resources\n- Gather all required raw resources before crafting items. For instance, wood must be gathered as it cannot be crafted from other resources.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into entities. Ensure you have enough quantity to complete the action."}
