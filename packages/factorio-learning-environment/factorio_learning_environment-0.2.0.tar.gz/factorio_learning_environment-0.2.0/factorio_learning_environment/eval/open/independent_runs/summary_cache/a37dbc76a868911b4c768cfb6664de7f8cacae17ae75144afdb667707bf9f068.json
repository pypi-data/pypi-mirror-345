{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently working and requires fuel to operate.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which is currently holding coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting into the furnace without fuel\n- Ensure that the furnace has sufficient fuel before attempting to insert items. If the furnace status shows NO_FUEL, refuel it with coal or another fuel source.\n\n### Errors when inserting into the burner mining drill while the chest is full\n- The burner mining drill cannot continue mining if the chest at the drop position is full. Empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to allow the burner mining drill to continue its operation.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace without ingredients\n- If the furnace status shows NO_INGREDIENTS, make sure to insert the required raw materials for smelting.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: None specified in the execution logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `furnace_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (-15, -50)\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (41, -82)\n  - `wooden_chest_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (41, -80)"}
