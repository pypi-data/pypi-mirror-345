{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions:\n  - (x=-10.5, y=-48.5) connected to the furnace\n  - (x=-7.5, y=-49.5) connected to a wooden chest\n  - (x=-5.5, y=-49.5) not connected to any specific entity\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\n- **Belt Group** connecting the mining drill to the furnace, consisting of:\n  - Belts at positions:\n    - (x=-14.5, y=-54.5)\n    - (x=-13.5, y=-54.5)\n    - (x=-12.5, y=-54.5)\n    - (x=-15.5, y=-52.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Non-Compatible Entities\n- Ensure to use an inserter when connecting belts to entities like a wooden chest or a stone furnace. Belts cannot be connected directly to these entities.\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items, verify that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid errors related to insufficient inventory.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Issues\n- Investigate the iron plate production process to identify and resolve issues causing low production output. Consider checking fuel levels, inserter operations, and resource availability."}
