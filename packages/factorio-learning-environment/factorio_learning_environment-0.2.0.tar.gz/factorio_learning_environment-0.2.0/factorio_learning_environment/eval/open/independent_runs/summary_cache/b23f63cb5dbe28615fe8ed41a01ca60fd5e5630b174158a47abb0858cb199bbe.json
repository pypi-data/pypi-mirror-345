{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the structures and providing error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -84)\n- Mining setup:\n  - Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal\n  - Two storage iron chests at (41.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -84.5) containing 1600 coal each\n  - Primary wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) containing 599 coal\n  - Coal transport system with burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Belt network connecting various components\n\n### Furnace Setup (around x=45-49, y=-81)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n  - Both furnaces have 50 coal as fuel but no active ingredients\n- Storage chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Belt Transportation Network\n- Two main belt groups:\n  - First group: 18 belts connecting mining area to processing\n  - Second group: 10 belts running from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Verify target location is clear before placing inserters\n   - Check for water or other terrain restrictions before placement\n   - Ensure proper spacing between entities\n\n2. Belt Connection Issues\n   - Ensure proper alignment between entities before attempting belt connections\n   - Verify that connected entities are compatible for belt connections\n   - Check that belt paths are valid and continuous\n\n3. Inserter Positioning\n   - Ensure inserters have valid pickup and drop-off positions\n   - Verify inserter rotation matches intended material flow\n   - Check for proper clearance around inserter working area\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  - Success: When placement location is clear and valid\n  - Failure: When location is blocked or invalid terrain\n\n- connect_entities(): Creates connections between entities\n  - Success: When entities are properly aligned and compatible\n  - Failure: When path is invalid or entities incompatible\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- belt: TransportBelt"}
