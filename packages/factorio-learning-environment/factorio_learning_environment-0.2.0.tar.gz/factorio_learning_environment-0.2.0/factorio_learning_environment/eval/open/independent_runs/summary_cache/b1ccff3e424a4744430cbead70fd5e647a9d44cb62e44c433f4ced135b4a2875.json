{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex at (-2, -76)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-2.0, y=-76.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace (x=-1.0, y=-74.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Iron chest (x=1.5, y=-74.5) storing iron plates (219 plates)\n- Burner inserter (x=0.5, y=-74.5) transferring between furnace and chest\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Complex at (-21, -73)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-21.0, y=-73.0) mining copper ore\n- Iron chest (x=-21.5, y=-74.5) storing copper ore (377 ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=-19.0, y=-74.0) for smelting copper ore, currently full with 100 copper plates\n- Burner inserter (x=-20.5, y=-74.5) transferring between chest and furnace\n\n### Secondary Iron Processing Line at (3, -73)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces (x=3.0, y=-73.0 and x=5.0, y=-73.0)\n- Multiple iron chests for storage:\n  - At (x=3.5, y=-75.5) containing 50 iron plates\n  - At (x=7.5, y=-72.5) containing 18 iron plates\n  - At (x=3.5, y=-71.5) and (x=0.5, y=-72.5) currently empty\n- Multiple burner inserters:\n  - At (x=3.5, y=-74.5)\n  - At (x=5.5, y=-74.5)\n  - At (x=1.5, y=-72.5)\n  - At (x=6.5, y=-72.5)\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups connecting different parts of the facility:\n- Belt group from (1.5, -74.5) to (1.5, -72.5)\n- Belt group from (0.5, -71.5) to (8.5, -74.5)\n- Belt group connecting (2.5, -71.5) to (0.5, -71.5)\n- Belt group from (0.5, -70.5) to (7.5, -69.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Placement and Operation Errors\n- Avoid placing furnaces at the exact same position multiple times\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ingredients before expecting operation\n\n### Entity Output Blocking\n- Mining drills need a proper output sink (chest, belt, or furnace) to prevent output blocking\n- Ensure there's adequate storage or transport system to handle the output\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Multiple inserters are in \"waiting for source items\" state - ensure proper input availability\n- Check inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended source and destination entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Several furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper material flow\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to maintain continuous operation"}
