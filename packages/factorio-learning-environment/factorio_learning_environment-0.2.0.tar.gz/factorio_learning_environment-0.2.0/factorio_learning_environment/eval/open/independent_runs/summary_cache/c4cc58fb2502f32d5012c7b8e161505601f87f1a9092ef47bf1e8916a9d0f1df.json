{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 5})\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: [Ingredient(name='iron-ore', count=40000)]\n  - Neighbours: [Entity(name='stone-furnace', direction=DOWN, position=Position(x=-14.0, y=-49.0)]\n  - Drop Position: Position(x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a burner mining drill failed due to lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities is not occupied by another entity or obstructed. This includes:\n  - Transport Belts\n  - Wooden Chests\n  - Burner Inserters\n\n### Warnings on Output Blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from production entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Warnings on Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that production entities like the Stone Furnace have the necessary ingredients to process, preventing them from being idle."}
