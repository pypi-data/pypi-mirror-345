{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5). The chest is full, preventing further mining.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). These furnaces are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnaces experience periodic full output warnings, indicating that their output slots are full and need to be emptied to continue production.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (-14.5, -50.5). These chests are used for storing various items, though specific contents are not detailed in the logs.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Full Output Warnings in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and extract items from the furnace output slots to prevent production halts due to full output warnings.\n\n### Full Chest Warning for Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure to empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) regularly to allow continuous operation of the burner mining drill.\n\n### No Ingredients Warning in Furnaces\n- Maintain a steady supply of iron ore to the furnaces to prevent them from running out of ingredients and halting production.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:** None defined or invoked in the logs.\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
