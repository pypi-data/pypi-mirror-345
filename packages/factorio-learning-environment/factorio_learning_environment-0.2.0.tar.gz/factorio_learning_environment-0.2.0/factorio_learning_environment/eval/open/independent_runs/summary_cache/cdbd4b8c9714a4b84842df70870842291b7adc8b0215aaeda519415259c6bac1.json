{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0) with a status of \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 1.5) with a drop position at (2.5, 1.5), waiting for source items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 1.5) with a drop position at (4.5, 1.5), waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. For example, attempting to access a wooden chest at positions (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), and (4.5, 1.5) resulted in errors because no such entity was found.\n\n### Name Errors due to undefined variables\n- Before using a variable, ensure it is defined and correctly initialized. For example, errors occurred when trying to inspect the inventory of `first_chest` and `second_chest` because these variables were not defined.\n\n### Errors when inspecting chests\n- Double-check the positions of chests before attempting to inspect them. Errors occurred when inspecting chests at positions (2.5, 1.5) and (4.5, 1.5) due to incorrect assumptions about their existence.\n\n### General Error Handling\n- Implement error handling to gracefully manage situations where entities are not found or variables are not defined. This can prevent the program from crashing and provide more informative feedback."}
