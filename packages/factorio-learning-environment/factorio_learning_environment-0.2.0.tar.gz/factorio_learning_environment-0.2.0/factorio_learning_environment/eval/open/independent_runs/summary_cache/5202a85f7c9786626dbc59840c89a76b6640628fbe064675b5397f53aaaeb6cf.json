{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace array at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) - currently has 49 iron ore and is full of coal.\n- Furnace (position (2.0, 0.0)) - currently has 1 iron ore and is full of coal.\n- Furnace (position (4.0, 0.0)) - currently empty.\n- Furnace (position (6.0, 0.0)) - currently empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace has available inventory space before attempting to insert items. The error indicates that the furnace at position (0, 0) is full, preventing the insertion of coal. Check the inventory status of the furnace before performing the insert operation.\n\n### Errors when using coal\n- When trying to insert coal into a furnace, verify that the furnace is not already full of fuel. The error messages indicate that the furnace at position (0, 0) is full of coal, which prevents further insertion.\n\n### General inventory management\n- Monitor your inventory levels closely to avoid attempting to insert items into full inventories. The current inventory shows limited coal, which can lead to repeated errors when trying to insert coal into furnaces."}
