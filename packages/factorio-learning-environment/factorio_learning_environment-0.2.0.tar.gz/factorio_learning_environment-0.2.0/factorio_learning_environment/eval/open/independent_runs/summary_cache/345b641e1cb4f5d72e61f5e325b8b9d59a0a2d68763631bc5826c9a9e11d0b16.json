{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as Burner Mining Drills and Inserters, are refueled regularly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Verify that the inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to insert them into entities.\n\n### Errors with Unbound Local Variables\n- Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and assigned values before they are accessed in the code.\n\n### Errors Due to Incorrect Argument Types\n- When calling functions, ensure that the arguments passed are of the correct type, such as passing an Entity or Position object instead of an integer.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities have items available for the inserter to pick up, or adjust the setup to prevent the inserter from waiting indefinitely."}
