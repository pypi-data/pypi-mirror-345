{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -82.5), connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) containing 219 units of coal.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) currently empty.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- Iron Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) containing 1550 iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n### Coal Transport System\n- Belt Group consisting of:\n  - Belt from (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Belt from (49.5, -86.5) to (47.5, -86.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Belt from (43.5, -84.5) to (45.5, -84.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt from (45.5, -85.5) to (47.5, -85.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt from (52.5, -83.5) to (52.5, -85.5), direction UP.\n- Inventory contains 5 units of coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) with pickup position (53.5, -83.5) and drop position (55.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) containing 10 iron plates.\n\n### Stone Furnace\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have the required materials in your inventory before attempting to craft automation science packs. You need copper plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n### Failed Extraction Attempts\n- Move closer to the target entity from which you want to extract resources to avoid extraction failures.\n\n### No Ores Available for Smelting\n- Ensure that ores are available in the furnace or nearby chests to continue smelting operations.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of connected drills or inserters. For example, empty the chest at (40.5, -82.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
