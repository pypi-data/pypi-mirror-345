To mitigate such issues, adjust spacing, modify placement direction, or change the reference position.\n   - Wooden Chest Placement: An error was reported when placing a wooden chest at (1.5, 16.5) because the target position was out of range (distance 16.57 > maximum allowed 10). Ensure the player is within a valid close range before attempting placement.\n   - Small Electric Pole Placement: Attempts to place a small electric pole at (0.5, 19.5) failed either due to inventory shortages or because of obstructions from existing entities. Verify that the area is clear and the inventory holds the required item before placement.\n\n\u2022 Variable & Reference Management:\n   - Undefined Variable: The NameError for \u201cnew_inserter\u201d indicates that the variable used for rotating a burner inserter was not properly initialized. Always define and initialize all required variables before use.\n   - Nil Reference in Placement: An error (attempt to index local ref_entity (a nil value)) during burner inserter placement signals that an expected target reference was missing. Validate that all reference entities exist and are correctly assigned prior to placement operations.\n\n\u2022 Resource Insertion & Inventory Verification:\n   - Inserting Items: Errors when inserting copper plates (e.g., into the chest at (1.5, 17.5)) suggest that the target entity could not be found or was misaligned. Check that the intended entity is present and correctly positioned.\n   - Inventory Shortages: Multiple errors (such as \u201cNo small_electric_pole in inventory\u201d and failures due to missing copper plates) stress the importance of verifying resource availability prior to attempting placements or transfers.\n\n\u2022 Positioning & Proximity:\n   - Player Range: Placement failures can occur if the player is too far from the target location. Move closer to ensure that placement checks (which are based on player proximity, e.g., maximum distance of 10 units) succeed.\n\n\u2022 Assembly Process Concerns:\n   - Resource Shortage Warning: Despite a transfer from the dedicated copper buffer chest, AssemblingMachine1 still reports a copper-plate shortage. Monitor and maintain adequate resource supply to prevent production bottlenecks.\n\n"}
