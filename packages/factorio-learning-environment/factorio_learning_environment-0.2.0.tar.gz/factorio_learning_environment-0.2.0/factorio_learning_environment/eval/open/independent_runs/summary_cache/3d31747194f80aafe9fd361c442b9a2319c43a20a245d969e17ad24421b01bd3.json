{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of Transport Belts and a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore collection.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Various Belt Groups\n- Multiple BeltGroups are present, facilitating the transport of materials between different mining drills, furnaces, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Name Error\n- Ensure that all classes and objects, such as `StaticEntity`, are properly defined and imported before use to avoid `NameError`.\n\n### Attribute Error on BeltGroup\n- Verify that objects like `BeltGroup` have the necessary attributes before accessing them to prevent `AttributeError`. Consider using conditional checks or exception handling.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to pick up and that the destination is not full to avoid waiting status.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings about no ingredients.\n\n### Furnace Fuel Source is Full\n- Regularly check and manage the fuel source of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
