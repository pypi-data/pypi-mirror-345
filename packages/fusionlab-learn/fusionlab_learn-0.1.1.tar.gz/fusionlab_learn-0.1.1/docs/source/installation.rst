Installation
==============

This page covers how to install the ``fusionlab`` library.

Prerequisites
---------------

Before installing ``fusionlab``, ensure you have the following:

* **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher. You can check your Python
  version by running ``python --version``.

* **pip:** The Python package installer. Pip usually comes with
  Python. You can update it using ``pip install --upgrade pip``.

* **TensorFlow:** ``fusionlab``'s core neural network models (like
  TFT, XTFT) currently rely heavily on TensorFlow. You need a
  working installation of TensorFlow (version 2.x is recommended).

Installation from PyPI (Recommended)
--------------------------------------

The easiest way to install ``fusionlab`` is using ``pip``, which
will fetch the latest stable release from the Python Package Index
(PyPI):

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install fusionlab-learn

.. note::
   This command should automatically install required dependencies,
   including base libraries. However, **TensorFlow itself might
   need to be installed separately** depending on your system and
   environment configuration to ensure compatibility (e.g., with
   specific hardware like GPUs).

   It's recommended to install TensorFlow first, following the
   official TensorFlow installation guide:
   `Install TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>`_.

   For a typical CPU-only installation, you can often use:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install tensorflow

Installation from Source (for Development)
--------------------------------------------

If you want to work with the latest development version, contribute
to the project, or modify the code, you can install ``fusionlab``
directly from the source code on GitHub:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    .. code-block:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/earthai-tech/fusionlab-learn.git
       cd fusionlab

2.  **Install in editable mode:**
    This command installs the package, but allows you to edit the
    code directly without reinstalling.

    .. code-block:: bash

       pip install -e .

3.  **(Optional) Install development dependencies:**
    If you plan to run tests or contribute to the development,
    install the extra dependencies specified for development:

    .. code-block:: bash

       pip install -e .[dev]

Verify Installation
---------------------

To quickly check if ``fusionlab`` is installed correctly, you can
try importing it in Python and printing its version:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import fusionlab; print(fusionlab.__version__)"

If this command executes without errors and prints a version
number, the basic installation was successful.
