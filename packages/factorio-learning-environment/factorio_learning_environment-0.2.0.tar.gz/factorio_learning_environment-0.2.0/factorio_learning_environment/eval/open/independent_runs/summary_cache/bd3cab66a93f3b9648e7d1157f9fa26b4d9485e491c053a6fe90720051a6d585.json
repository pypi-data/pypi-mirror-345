{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources\n- The agent attempts to craft or build items but lacks the necessary resources in its inventory. Ensure sufficient resources are gathered before attempting to craft or build. For example, the agent repeatedly runs out of iron ore and wooden chests.\n\n### Inserter Blocked\n- The inserter is blocked by a transport belt or another entity. Ensure that there is enough space for the inserter to insert items into the target entity. The agent is repeatedly facing this issue with inserters at positions (40.5, -80.5), (6.5, -57.5), and (8.5, -57.5). It seems the transport belt at (39.5, -80.5) is blocking the inserter at (40.5, -80.5). However, the transport belt is sometimes not there.\n\n### Inserter Already Has Fuel\n- The inserter already has fuel and cannot be refueled. Check the inserter's inventory before attempting to add more fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\nThere are no functions defined in the namespace.\n\n### Variables\n- Inventory: `{'transport-belt': 13, 'burner-inserter': 2, 'wood': 100, 'coal': 3600, 'iron-plate': 401}` (dict)\n- Inserter inventory: `{'coal': 48}` (dict)\n"}
