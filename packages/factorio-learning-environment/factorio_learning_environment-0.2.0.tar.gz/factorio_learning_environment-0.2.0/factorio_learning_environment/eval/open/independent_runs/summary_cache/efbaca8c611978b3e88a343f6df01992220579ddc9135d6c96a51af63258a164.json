{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled by coal, used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) for coal storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) for coal storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) for transferring coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for temporary coal storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that the inserter has a clear path to pick up and drop items. The inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a possible blockage or misalignment. Verify the inserter's pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Furnace Overcapacity\n- The stone furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) frequently reaches full capacity for iron plates. Regularly extract iron plates to prevent production halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources such as wood, coal, and iron plates.\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Monitors the inventory of the stone furnace, including iron ore and iron plates."}
