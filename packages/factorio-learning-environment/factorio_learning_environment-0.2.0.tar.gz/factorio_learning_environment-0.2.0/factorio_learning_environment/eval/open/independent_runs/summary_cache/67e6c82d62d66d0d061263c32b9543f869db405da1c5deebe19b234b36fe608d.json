{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) for resource drop-off. The drill is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position is full.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients. It has a wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) that contains iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when refueling the Burner Mining Drill**\n  - Ensure that the drill has enough space in the associated chest to continue mining. The current chest is full, which prevents further mining.\n  \n- **Errors when feeding the Stone Furnace**\n  - Make sure to have the required ingredients available before attempting to feed the furnace. Currently, the furnace has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (-15, -50)\n  - `stone_furnace_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (0, 0)\n  - `wooden_chest_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (-14, -48)\n  - `iron_ore_inventory`: int = 3155\n  - `iron_plate_inventory`: int = 100\n  - `coal_inventory`: int = 5"}
