{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully built on the map during these steps. Repeated attempts to craft and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed due to inventory shortages and missing ingredients. Although furnace entities were retrieved and used for smelting operations\u2014one furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) employed for iron plate production and another at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) used for copper plate production\u2014these were pre\u2010existing facilities rather than new constructions.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval\n  \u2013 Use the correct parameters when calling get_entities. Passing unsupported keyword arguments such as \u201cradius\u201d or an incorrect number of positional arguments leads to TypeErrors.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Iteration Issues\n  \u2013 Verify that required items (e.g., a lab) are present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  \u2013 Check that functions returning collections (such as get_entities) do not yield None before iterating over their results.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Failures\n  \u2013 Ensure that all prerequisite sub-ingredients (for example, iron\u2011gear\u2011wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available or can be produced before attempting to craft a Lab.\n  \u2013 Confirm resource availability and production capacity for intermediate components to avoid missing ingredient errors."}
