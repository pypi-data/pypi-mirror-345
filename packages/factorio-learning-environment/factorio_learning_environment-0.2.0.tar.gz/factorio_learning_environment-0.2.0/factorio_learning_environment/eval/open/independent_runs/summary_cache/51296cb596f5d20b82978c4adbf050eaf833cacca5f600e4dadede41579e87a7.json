{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Connected via a Pipe Group (fluid system 70731) running from (-9.5, 23.5) to (1.5, 23.5) and other positions\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a status of 'no ingredients to smelt'\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates and copper plates\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group (id 367266) with poles at positions such as (7.5, -60.5), (5.5, -60.5), and others, currently with 0 voltage\n- Electricity Group (id 367276) with poles at positions such as (2.5, 27.5), (5.5, 27.5), and others, currently with 33 voltage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, connecting small electric poles failed due to missing items.\n\n### Errors when Crafting Items\n- Ensure you have all necessary sub-ingredients before crafting an item. Crafting small electric poles failed due to a lack of copper cables, which in turn required copper plates that need to be smelted in a furnace or crafted in a machine.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. The inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) is not receiving electricity, indicating a possible disconnection or lack of power supply."}
