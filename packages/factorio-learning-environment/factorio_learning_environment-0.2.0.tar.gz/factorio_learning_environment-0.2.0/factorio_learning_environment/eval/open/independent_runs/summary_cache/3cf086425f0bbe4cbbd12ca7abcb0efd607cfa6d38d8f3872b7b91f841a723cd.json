Its designated steam output point is at (0.5, 17.5) and a manual pipeline route was attempted with successful pipe placements at (4.5, 17.5), (4.5, 13.5), (4.5, 11.5) and (5.5, 7.5) despite errors at other intermediate positions.\n- Steam Engine (position: 5.5, 5.5) \u2013 Generates electricity; reconnected via the connect_entities tool and now operating with a WORKING status and no warnings.\n\n### Pipe Production Facility at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine (position: 3.5, 0.5) \u2013 Configured for pipe crafting using a recipe that requires iron plates; currently issues warnings for no power and a missing iron-plate resource.\n- Iron Chest (position: 1.5, 0.5) \u2013 Stores crafted pipes.\n- Electricity Network \u2013 Comprised of small electric poles at positions (2.5, 2.5), (3.5, 2.5), (4.5, 3.5), (6.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), (3.5, -2.5) and (3.5, -1.5). Multiple attempts to place additional poles (to the left and above the assembler) failed due to placement collisions.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Pipe Placement and Pipeline Connection Issues\n\u2003- Errors while placing pipes at (2.5, 17.5), (4.5, 15.5), (4.5, 9.5), (5.5, 9.5) and (5.5, 5.5) indicate that target tiles are obstructed. Verify that the intended placement locations are clear before deploying pipe segments.\n\u2003- When manually connecting the pipeline (from the boiler\u2019s steam output at (0.5, 17.5) to the steam engine at (5.5, 5.5)), ensure alignment and remove any blocking entities to allow successful connections.\n\n\u2022 Electric Pole Placement Challenges\n\u2003- Failures to place additional small electric poles\u2014whether adjacent (spacing 0) or in specified directions with spacing (LEFT with spacing=1 or UP with spacing=1)\u2014are caused by collisions with existing poles or nearby structures. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions to secure a clear and viable placement.\n\n\u2022 General Connection and Placement Considerations\n\u2003- Always check that the target tiles for any entity (pipes or poles) are unoccupied and free of obstructions to prevent placement errors.\n\u2003- Maintain alignment between connection endpoints to ensure that reconnection tools (such as connect_entities) achieve consistent and stable network links.\n\u2003- Retain vigilance in fuel and resource monitoring (e.g., boiler fuel levels and pipe inventory) to mitigate recurring operational issues."}
