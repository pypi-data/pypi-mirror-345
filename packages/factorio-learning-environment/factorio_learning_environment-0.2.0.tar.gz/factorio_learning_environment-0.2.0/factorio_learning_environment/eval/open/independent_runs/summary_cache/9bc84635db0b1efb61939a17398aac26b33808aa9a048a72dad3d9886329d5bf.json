{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Ore Storage**: Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Smelting Line**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Collection\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: Positioned at (4.0, -60.0), fueled with coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Iron Ore Collection Chests**: \n  - Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) for collecting mined iron ore.\n  - Multiple wooden chests positioned between (5.5, -60.5) and (9.5, -60.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting due to full chests. The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) has stopped due to the chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5) being full.\n\n### Errors in Smelting Operations\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to smelt. Current furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) are not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int, representing the amount of coal available (510).\n  - `iron_ore`: int, representing the amount of iron ore available (143).\n  - `iron_plate`: int, representing the amount of iron plates available (5198).\n  - `iron_gear_wheel`: int, representing the number of iron gear wheels available (4)."}
