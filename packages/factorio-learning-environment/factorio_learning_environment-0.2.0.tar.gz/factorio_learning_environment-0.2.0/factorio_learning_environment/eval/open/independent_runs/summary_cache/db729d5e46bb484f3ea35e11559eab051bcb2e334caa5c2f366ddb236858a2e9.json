{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(-10.0, -59.0)\nComplex mining setup consisting of:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters connecting the drills to chests at positions (-6.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -56.5), (-4.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -56.5)\n- Transport belt network connecting various parts\n\n###Iron Plate Production Line at position(-27.0, -59.0)\nSmelting setup consisting of:\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0) with burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5) with burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Additional furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Burner inserters at (-20.5, -59.5) and (-22.5, -56.5)\n- Output chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n\n###Main Smelting Array at position(0.0, 0.0)\nLarge smelting array consisting of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for input at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for output at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- Connected by transport belt networks\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters at occupied positions\n- Check if the target position is already occupied by another inserter before placement\n- Increase spacing parameter when using place_entity_next_to function\n- Consider using different directions or reference positions if the default placement fails\n\n### Resource management issues\n- Empty chests regularly to prevent \"chest is full\" warnings blocking production\n- Keep mining drills fueled to prevent \"out of fuel\" status\n- Ensure proper connection between input/output entities to prevent \"waiting for source items\" status\n\n### Entity placement coordination\n- Verify that all components of a production line (miners, inserters, chests) are properly connected\n- Ensure there are valid paths for items to move between entities\n- Check that inserters have both pickup and drop positions properly configured"}
