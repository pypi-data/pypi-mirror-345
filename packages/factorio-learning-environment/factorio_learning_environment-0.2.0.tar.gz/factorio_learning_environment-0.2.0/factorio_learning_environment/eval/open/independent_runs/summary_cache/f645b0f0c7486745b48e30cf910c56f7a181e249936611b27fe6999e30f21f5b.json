{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Infrastructure at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, with segments at positions such as (-12.5, 19.5) and (-8.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity poles forming a network, with poles at positions such as (13.5, 13.5) and (-12.5, 26.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a status indicating no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) connected to power, but with warnings about not receiving electricity\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Power Infrastructure\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify the positions and connections to avoid failures.\n- Check that all entities in the power infrastructure are properly connected to the electricity network to avoid the \"NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\" status.\n\n### Errors when Placing Mining Drills\n- Verify that the target position for placing mining drills is suitable and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Power Connection\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly connected to the electricity network and receiving power. Check the connections with small electric poles and ensure there are no gaps in the network."}
