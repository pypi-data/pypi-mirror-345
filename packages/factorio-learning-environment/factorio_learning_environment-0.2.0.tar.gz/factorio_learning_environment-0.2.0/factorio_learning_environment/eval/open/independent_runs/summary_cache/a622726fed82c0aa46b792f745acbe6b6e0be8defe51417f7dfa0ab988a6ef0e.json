The error \"NameError: name 'Entity' is not defined\" suggests that 'Entity' was not defined in the scope. Verify that the correct module or class is imported and accessible.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- When retrieving entities, ensure that the entity exists at the specified position. The error \"Could not get Prototype.Boiler at position\" indicates that there was no boiler found at the given coordinates. Double-check the position and ensure the entity is placed correctly.\n\n### Pipe Connection Errors\n- Before attempting to connect pipes, ensure there are no blockages or obstructions in the path. The error \"Failed to connect pipes due to placement blockage\" suggests that the path was obstructed. Clear any obstructions and verify the path is clear for connection.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
