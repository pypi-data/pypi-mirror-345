{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (0.5, 1.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (0.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (2.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Lab at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (3.5, 0.5) which is currently not powered.\n\n### Chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new poles\n- Ensure that you are not providing multiple values for the 'direction' argument when placing new poles. Check the parameters being passed to the placement function.\n\n### Errors when the lab is not powered\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Check the power connections and ensure that the electricity generator is functioning properly.\n\n### Errors when picking up obstructing entities\n- Make sure to clear the area of any obstructing entities before attempting to place new structures or poles.\n\n### Errors when needing ingredients for research\n- Ensure that you have the required ingredients (in this case, 10 automation science packs) in your inventory before starting research. Check your inventory and gather the necessary items beforehand."}
