{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has yielded partial success:\n\n### New Active Furnace Status:\n- The active furnace now shows **2 pieces of stone** after the last insertion.\n- The furnace status is **\"WORKING\"**, indicating it is operational but still not processing any materials.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the new one)\n  - 9 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **1 piece of stone** available (after loading).\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace still requires a total of **5 pieces of stone** to initiate the smelting process for Copper Ore.\n- Currently, it has only **2 pieces of stone** loaded, meaning I need to add **3 more pieces** to meet the requirement.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Remaining Stone**: I will insert the remaining **3 pieces of stone** into the active furnace.\n2. **Confirm Smelting Activation**: After loading the stone, I will check if the furnace begins processing the Copper Ore.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by inserting the remaining pieces of stone into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the remaining 3 pieces of stone into the active furnace to meet smelting requirements\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, new_active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Insert the required pieces of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nnew_active_furnace_inventory_status_after_final_stone_insertion = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_final_stone_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone.\n\nprint(f\"New Active Furnace inventory status after loading final pieces of stone: {new_active_furnace_inventory_status_after_final_stone_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading final pieces of stone: {overall_inventory_after_final_stone_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-384]"}
