{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 6})\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Entity(name='stone-furnace', direction=DOWN, position=Position(x=-14.0, y=-49.0))\n  - Resources: [Ingredient(name='iron-ore', count=40000)]\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is free before attempting to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts. Multiple attempts to place these entities failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors when moving Stone Furnace\n- Verify that the destination tile for moving a Stone Furnace is unoccupied and suitable for placement to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Errors occurred when trying to get a Stone Furnace at positions where it was not present.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Address the warning regarding the Burner Mining Drill's output being blocked by ensuring a sink entity is in place to accept the output, such as a transport belt or inserter leading to a furnace or chest.\n\n### No Ingredients Warning in Furnace\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt by connecting it to a source of raw materials, such as a mining drill or transport belt carrying iron ore."}
