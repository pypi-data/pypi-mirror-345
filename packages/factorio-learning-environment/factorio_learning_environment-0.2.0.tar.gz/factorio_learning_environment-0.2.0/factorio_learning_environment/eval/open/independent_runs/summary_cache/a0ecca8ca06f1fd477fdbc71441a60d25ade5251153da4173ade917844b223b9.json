{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting.\n- Multiple Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for moving coal between chests and furnaces.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Multiple Iron Chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storage.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-12.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -45.5), and (-10.5, -45.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-11.5, -49.5), (-10.5, -49.5), (-8.5, -49.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) for moving materials between chests and furnaces.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that the upstream supply chain is not interrupted and that there are sufficient items available for the inserters to process. Check the supply of raw materials to ensure continuous operation.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination storage (e.g., chests or belts) has enough space to accommodate items being transferred by the inserters. Regularly clear out or expand storage to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n#### Full Chest Warnings\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of space. Consider expanding storage capacity if necessary.\n\n#### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production. Check the supply chain feeding into the furnaces and adjust as needed to prevent idle time."}
