{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(x=0.5, y=6.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5) - removed in step 7\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Pipe network connecting offshore pump to boiler (positions: x=-8.5,y=-0.5 to x=-5.5,y=0.5)\n- Pipe network connecting boiler to steam engine (positions: x=-6.5,y=3.5 to x=-3.5,y=6.5)\n- Power poles forming electricity network (positions: x=0.5,y=8.5 to x=-17.5,y=30.5)\n\n### Stone mining operation at position(x=-46.5, y=-0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-46.5, y=-0.5) - removed in step 6\n- Stone furnace (position x=-41.0, y=0.0)\n- Inserter (position x=-42.5, y=0.5) - removed in step 4\n- Transport belts connecting components - removed in step 6\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement errors due to existing entities\n- Always check if an entity exists at the target position before placing\n- Remove existing entities before attempting to place new ones in the same location\n- Verify positions are clear when placing multiple furnaces in an array\n\n### Distance-related placement errors\n- Move within 10 tiles of the target position before attempting to place entities\n- The player must be close enough to the placement location (max distance = 10)\n\n### Water-related placement errors\n- Avoid placing entities where their footprint would overlap water\n- Check terrain carefully when placing near water sources\n- Offshore pumps must be placed directly adjacent to water\n\n### Inserter placement errors\n- Increase spacing when placing inserters next to existing entities\n- Verify there's adequate space for inserter placement considering direction\n- Remove existing inserters before placing new ones in the same location\n\n### Entity connection errors\n- Ensure offshore pumps are properly connected to water sources\n- Verify all fluid connections are properly established\n- Check that power poles properly connect to all electrical devices"}
