{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (x=1-3, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (x=1.0, y=1.0) and (x=3.0, y=1.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (x=1.5, y=2.5) and (x=3.5, y=2.5)\n- Two wooden chests at positions (x=1.5, y=3.5) and (x=3.5, y=3.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Additional Storage at (x=5.5, y=2.5-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- One wooden chest at position (x=5.5, y=3.5)\n- One burner inserter at position (x=5.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line at (x=2-4, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (x=2.0, y=7.0) and (x=4.0, y=7.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (x=2.5, y=8.5) and (x=4.5, y=8.5)\n- Two wooden chests at positions (x=2.5, y=9.5) and (x=4.5, y=9.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Power Generation System at (x=-5.5 to 13.5, y=26.5-35.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=2.5, y=35.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=7.0, y=35.5)\n- Steam engine at position (x=13.5, y=35.5)\n- Pipe network connecting components:\n  - Water pipes from pump to boiler (fluid system 1517)\n  - Steam pipes from boiler to engine (fluid system 1520)\n- Electric pole network connecting various parts of the factory\n\n### Disconnected Pump\n- Unused offshore pump at position (x=-5.5, y=26.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Boiler is out of fuel and needs coal to operate efficiently\n- Ensure regular fuel supply to maintain continuous power generation\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n- Maintain consistent supply of raw materials to furnaces to prevent idle time\n\n### Fluid System Management\n- Disconnected offshore pump at (x=-5.5, y=26.5) shows \"No fluid present in connections\" warning\n- Either connect the pump to a fluid system or remove it if not needed\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure all burner inserters have sufficient fuel to maintain continuous operation\n- Monitor fuel levels in all burner-powered entities regularly"}
