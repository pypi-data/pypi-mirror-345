{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace setup at position(0, 0) and (2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0, 0) with coal as fuel and iron-ore as input, producing iron-plate.\n- Furnace at position (2, 0) with coal as fuel but no ingredients to smelt, resulting in no output.\n\n### Storage chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest containing copper-plate.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure that the item you are trying to craft exists in the game. For example, 'Prototype.Coil' does not exist; you may have meant 'Coal' or 'Boiler'.\n- Verify that all required ingredients for crafting are available in your inventory or can be produced by your current setup.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. For instance, you cannot insert coal if you do not have any in your inventory.\n\n### Errors related to missing recipes\n- If you encounter an error stating that a recipe does not exist, ensure that the item you are trying to craft can be produced with the current machines available. For example, 'iron-gear-wheel' requires 'iron-plate', which must be produced in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
