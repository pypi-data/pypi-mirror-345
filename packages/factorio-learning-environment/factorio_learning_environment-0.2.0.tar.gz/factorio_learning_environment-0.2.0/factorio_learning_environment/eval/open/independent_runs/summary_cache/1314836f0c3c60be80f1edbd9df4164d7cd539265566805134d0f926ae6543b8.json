{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Groups connecting the steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump:\n  - Pipe Group at position (5.5, 18.5)\n  - Pipe Group at position (-1.5, 22.5)\n  - Pipe Group at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n  - Pipe Group at position (0.5, 24.5)\n  - Pipe Group at position (-9.5, 23.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserters and Wooden Chests for material handling:\n  - Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) with associated chests at (8.5, -0.5) and (8.5, 1.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) with associated chest at (17.5, -0.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (19.5, 0.5) with associated chests at (19.5, -0.5) and (20.5, -0.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (20.5, 0.5) with associated chests at (19.5, -0.5) and (20.5, -0.5)\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab connected to power source, positioned at an unspecified location but connected through the electricity network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the target position for placing pipes is not already occupied by another entity. Remove any existing entities before attempting to place a new pipe.\n- Verify that you have the necessary pipes or pipe-to-ground in your inventory before attempting to reconnect pipes.\n- Move closer to the target position when placing pipes if the distance is too far; the maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors in Research Initiation\n- Ensure that the research technology is correctly specified and available before attempting to initiate research.\n- Make sure that the lab has the required science packs to start the research.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items\n- Double-check the attribute names when crafting items. For example, use the correct attribute 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround' if applicable.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, make sure the target tile is unoccupied and within the allowable placement distance.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors Due to Undefined Names\n- Ensure all functions and variables are correctly defined and imported before use. For example, ensure 'builtins' is defined if it is being used in the code."}
