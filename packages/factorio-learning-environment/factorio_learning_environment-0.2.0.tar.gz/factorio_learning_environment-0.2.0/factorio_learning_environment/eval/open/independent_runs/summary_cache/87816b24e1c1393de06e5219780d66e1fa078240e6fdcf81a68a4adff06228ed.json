{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace, but is currently misaligned.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which is supposed to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but is currently not receiving any iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misaligned Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the inserter's position and alignment to ensure it is correctly configured.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel in Machines\n- Regularly check fuel levels in all machines, especially the burner mining drill and inserter, to ensure continuous operation. Keep a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory for refueling purposes.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is properly functioning and aligned to deliver iron ore to the furnace. Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining operation. Regularly extract items from the chest to maintain space for new resources.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the efficiency of the resource processing setup can be significantly improved."}
