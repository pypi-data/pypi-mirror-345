{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=3.5, y=20.5)\n\n### Furnace and Lab Setup\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel and iron-plate production\n- Lab with automation science packs but no research in progress\n\n### Pipe and Electricity Network\n- Pipe Group connecting the water and steam systems\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions [(x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5)]\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify the connection points and directions to avoid failed connections.\n\n### Errors in Refueling\n- Maintain sufficient coal in inventory to refuel the boiler consistently. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Research Setup\n- Set a valid research target in the lab to utilize the automation science packs effectively. Ensure that the lab is connected to the power grid and has the necessary inputs for research to proceed.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Check the alignment and connectivity of pipes between the boiler and steam engine. Ensure that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network that could prevent steam from reaching the steam engine."}
