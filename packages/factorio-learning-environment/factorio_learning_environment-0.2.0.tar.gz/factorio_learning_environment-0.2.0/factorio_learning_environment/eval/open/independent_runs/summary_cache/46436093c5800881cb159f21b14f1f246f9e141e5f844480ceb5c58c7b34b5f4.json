{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and another at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for crafting copper cables\n- Inserter at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=5.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting the Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) to the Assembling Machine\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storing resources\n- Inserters and Transport Belts for moving items between structures\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have enough copper cables in your inventory before attempting to craft small electric poles. The recipe requires 2 copper cables per pole.\n\n### Errors in Inserting Items\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure you have copper ore before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors with Resource Shortages\n- Regularly check and maintain your inventory levels to avoid shortages that can halt production, such as missing copper plates for crafting copper cables.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Keep your boilers and furnaces fueled to prevent them from stopping production due to lack of fuel."}
