{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (x=1-3, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (1.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 2.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing iron plates at positions (1.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 3.5)\n\n### Empty Production Line (x=5.5, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter at position (5.5, 2.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (5.5, 3.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (x=2-4.5, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (2.0, 7.0) and (4.0, 7.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (2.5, 8.5) and (4.5, 8.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing copper plates at positions (2.5, 9.5) and (4.5, 9.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-5.5 to 16, y=26.5-35.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (2.5, 35.5)\n- Boiler at position (7.0, 35.5)\n- Steam engine at position (13.5, 35.5)\n- Two pipe groups connecting components:\n  - Water pipe system at (5.5, 33.5) connecting offshore pump to boiler\n  - Steam pipe system at (9.5, 35.5) connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple poles spanning from (0.5, 26.5) to (13.5, 33.5)\n- Non-functional offshore pump at position (-5.5, 26.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required crafting materials are in inventory before attempting to craft (e.g., small electric poles require wood and copper cable)\n- Check for required fuel (coal) in inventory before attempting to insert into machines\n\n### Connection and Placement Errors\n- Ensure all fluid-carrying entities (pipes, offshore pumps, boilers, steam engines) are properly connected to form complete systems\n- Some offshore pumps are not connected to any fluid system - ensure proper placement and connections\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Power system showing 0 voltage - verify fuel supply to boiler and proper steam flow through the system\n- Ensure boilers have adequate coal supply to generate steam\n- Check that steam connections between boiler and steam engine are complete and functional"}
