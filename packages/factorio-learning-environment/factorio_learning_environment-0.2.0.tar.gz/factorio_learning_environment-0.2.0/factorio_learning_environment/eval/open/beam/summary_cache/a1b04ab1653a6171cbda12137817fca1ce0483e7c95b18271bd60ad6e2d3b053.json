{"content": "It seems like the script is not progressing beyond the initial print statement, \"Initiating detailed diagnostic checks on entity setup...\". This indicates that there might be an issue early in the script, possibly related to the retrieval of entities or the setup of the environment.\n\nHere are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Entity Retrieval**: Ensure that the `get_entities` function is correctly implemented and that the entities are present in the game world. If the entities are not being retrieved, the script will not proceed.\n\n2. **Add Debugging Prints**: Add print statements immediately after each `get_entities` call to verify that entities are being retrieved correctly. This will help identify which entity retrieval is failing.\n\n3. **Check for Exceptions**: Ensure that exceptions are being caught and printed. If an exception is occurring before the assertions, it might not be visible. Double-check the exception handling block to ensure it captures and prints any errors.\n\n4. **Environment Setup**: Double-check the setup of your Factorio environment to ensure all entities are correctly placed and accessible. If the environment is not set up correctly, the entities might not be found.\n\n5. **Simplify the Script**: Temporarily simplify the script to only include entity retrieval and basic logging. This can help isolate the issue to a specific part of the code.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the script with additional debugging prints:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Initiating detailed diagnostic checks on entity setup...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Retrieve necessary entities with detailed logging\n    print(\"Retrieving entities...\")\n    \n    offshore_pumps = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    print(f\"Offshore Pumps found: {offshore_pumps}\")\n    \n    boilers = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    print(f\"Boilers found: {boilers}\")\n    \n    steam_engines = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    print(f\"Steam Engines found: {steam_engines}\")\n    \n    electric_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    print(f\"Electric Poles found: {electric_poles}\")\n    \n    assembling_machines = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n    print(f\"Assembling Machines found: {assembling_machines}\")\n\n    # Check for presence of all required entities\n    missing_entities = []\n    if not offshore_pumps:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Offshore Pump\")\n    if not boilers:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Boiler\")\n    if not steam_engines:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Steam Engine\")\n    if not electric_poles:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Electric Pole\")\n    if not assembling_machines:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Assembling Machine\")\n\n    if missing_entities:\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Missing Entities: {', '.join(missing_entities)}\")\n\n    print(\"All necessary entities are confirmed present.\")\n\nexcept AssertionError as ae:\n    print(f\"Entity Retrieval Error: {ae}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Unexpected Diagnostic Error: {e}\")\n```\n\nBy simplifying the script and adding more detailed logging, you should be able to identify where the issue is occurring and take appropriate action to resolve it.", "summary_range": "[1-342]"}
