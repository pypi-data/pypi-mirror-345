{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup (steam) connecting the boiler and steam engine, starting at Position (x=3.5, y=17.5)\n- PipeGroup (water) connecting the offshore pump and boiler, starting at Position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles distributed across various positions, providing voltage to connected entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly aligned and positioned to connect with each other. Verify that the connection points are accessible and that the entities are compatible for connection.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
