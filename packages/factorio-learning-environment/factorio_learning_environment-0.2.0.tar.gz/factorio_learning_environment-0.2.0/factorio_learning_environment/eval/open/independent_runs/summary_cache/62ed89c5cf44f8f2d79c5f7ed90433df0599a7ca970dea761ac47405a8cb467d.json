{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -49.0) which is actively working. It is fueled by coal and processes iron ore to produce iron plates.\n\n### Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (42.0, -83.0) which is currently waiting for space in the destination due to blocked output.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -81.5) which is waiting for source items and is connected to the mining drill and transport belts.\n- **Transport Belts** aligned correctly at positions (43.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -80.5), facilitating the movement of resources.\n\n### Belt Group\nConsists of:\n- **BeltGroup** with inputs and outputs connecting various positions, ensuring the movement of items between the mining drill, inserter, and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- **Cannot Place Wooden Chest**: Ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a wooden chest. This error occurred at multiple positions such as (45.0, -79.5), (46.0, -79.5), and others.\n- **Cannot Place Burner Inserter**: Similar to the wooden chest, verify that the target tile is free of other entities before placing a burner inserter. This error was noted at positions like (44.5, -79.5), (45.5, -79.5), and others.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drill\n- **Output Blocked by Item on the Ground**: Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the burner mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- **Chest is Full**: Regularly check and clear the contents of chests to prevent inserters from being unable to deposit items, which can halt production processes."}
