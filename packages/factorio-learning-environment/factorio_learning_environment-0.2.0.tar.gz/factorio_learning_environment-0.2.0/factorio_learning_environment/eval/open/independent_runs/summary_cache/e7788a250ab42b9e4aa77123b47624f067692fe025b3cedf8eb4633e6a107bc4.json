{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=2.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Copper Ore Collection Point\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=19.5, y=18.5) collecting copper ore\n\n### Iron Ore Collection Point\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) collecting iron ore\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) putting items into the assembling machine\n- Belt group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Various small electric poles distributed across the map for power distribution\n- Pipe groups and electricity groups for fluid and power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, the wooden chest was not in the inventory when attempted to place at position (19.5, 18.5).\n\n### Errors related to power and resource shortages\n- Check that all entities requiring power are connected to a power source and that the power source is operational.\n- Ensure that all production entities have the necessary input resources to function, such as copper plates for the assembling machine or fuel for the boiler and burner mining drills."}
