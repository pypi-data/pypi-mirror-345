{"content": "It seems that the movement commands have been executed successfully, allowing you to approach the iron ore patch incrementally. \n\n### Summary of Actions:\n1. You successfully moved to positions (0.0, 74.0), (0.0, 75.0), (0.0, 76.0), and (0.0, 77.0) in your attempts to reach the iron ore patch.\n\n### Tips for Future Actions:\n1. **Plan Your Path**: Before executing multiple movement commands, consider planning a more direct route to the target resource. This can save time and reduce the number of commands needed.\n\n2. **Check Resource Proximity**: After reaching a position, check if you are within range of the iron ore before moving again. This can help avoid unnecessary movements.\n\n3. **Combine Actions**: If you know you will need to harvest resources after reaching the patch, consider combining the movement and harvesting commands to streamline the process.\n\n4. **Use Inventory Checks**: Before moving to gather resources, ensure you have enough inventory space and that you are equipped to harvest the resource effectively.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: If you encounter any issues during movement, implement checks to ensure that you are not attempting to move to an invalid position or a location that is blocked by other entities.\n\nBy following these tips, you can enhance your efficiency and reduce the likelihood of errors in future interactions with the environment.", "summary_range": "[1-230]"}
