{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5), currently not connected due to no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0), also not connected with similar warnings as the steam engine.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), working and connected to a pipe at Position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with water fluid system (31287) full output.\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions, including (x=15.5, y=17.5) and (x=-9.5, y=23.5), with some sections empty and others full output.\n\n### Pipe and Electricity Network\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=31283) spanning positions such as (x=15.5, y=17.5) and (x=12.5, y=20.5), currently empty.\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=14.5, y=20.5) and (x=10.5, y=17.5), currently with zero voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connectivity\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly connected to both the boiler and the steam engine to allow fluid flow. Verify that there are no blockages or misalignments in pipe connections.\n\n### Errors with Placement Blockage\n- Before attempting to connect pipes, ensure that the path is clear of any blockages that could prevent successful placement and connection.\n\n### Errors with Electric Pole Placement\n- When placing electric poles, ensure there is a suitable position available that is not occupied by other entities or terrain features.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions defined or invoked in the given steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `fluid_system_31287`: Represents the water fluid system connected to the offshore pump.\n  - `pipe_inventory`: Tracks the number of pipes available for use, currently at 213.\n  - `electricity_group_id_56189`: Represents the electricity network, currently with zero voltage.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the existing structures and identifies key errors and tips for improvement."}
