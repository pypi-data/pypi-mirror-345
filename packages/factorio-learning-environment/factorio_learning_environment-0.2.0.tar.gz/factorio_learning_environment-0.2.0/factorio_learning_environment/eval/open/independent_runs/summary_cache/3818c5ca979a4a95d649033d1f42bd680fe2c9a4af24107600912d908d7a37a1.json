{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures built on the map. The agent has attempted to place various entities such as Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts, but all placement attempts have failed due to non-buildable positions or other placement errors. As a result, there are no structures or entities on the map to summarize.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is buildable. Check the terrain and any existing entities that might block placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Before attempting to place an entity, verify that the tile is not already occupied by another entity. This can be done by checking the map for existing entities at the desired location.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources available before attempting to supply entities like Furnaces. Check your inventory for required items such as coal or iron plates.\n\n### General placement errors\n- When placing entities such as Wooden Chests or Transport Belts, ensure that the intended location is within the allowed build area and free from any global restrictions that might prevent placement.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for building and supplying structures. This will help avoid errors related to missing resources.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in building and managing structures on the map."}
