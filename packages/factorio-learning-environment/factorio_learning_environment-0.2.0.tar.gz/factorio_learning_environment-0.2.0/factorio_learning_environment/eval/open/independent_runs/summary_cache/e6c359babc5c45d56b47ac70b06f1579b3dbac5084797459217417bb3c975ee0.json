This furnace serves as the central component of the smelting setup, having been used in multiple smelting cycles\u2014including retries and extended wait times\u2014to process iron ore with coal. It now features updated fuel reserves (e.g. increasing coal reserves from prior operations) and has been involved in successive input insertions and extractions, ensuring continuous production of iron plates for downstream crafting. The structure remains at position (0.0, 0.0).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Incorrect argument type for insertion operations\n  - When inserting items into a furnace, provide a valid entity or entity group instead of a position value.\n\n\u2022 Smelting additional input timeouts\n  - Ensure that the furnace has sufficient and balanced fuel and input resources before initiating additional smelting cycles. Extending wait times may help but verifying resource quantities is key to avoid timeouts.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient inventory for input operations\n  - Before attempting to insert resources into the furnace, confirm that the inventory holds the required quantity. This prevents assertion errors due to a shortage of resources.\n\n\u2022 Crafting prerequisite errors (previous)\n  - Verify that all necessary raw materials are available prior to crafting to prevent failures during the crafting process."}
