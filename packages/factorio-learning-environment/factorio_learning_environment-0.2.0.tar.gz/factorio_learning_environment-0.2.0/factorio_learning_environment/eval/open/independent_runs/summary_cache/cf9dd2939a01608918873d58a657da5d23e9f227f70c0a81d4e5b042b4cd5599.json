{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Connected by a Pipe Group with positions ranging from (21.5, -10.5) to (20.5, -5.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions (e.g., (24.5, -7.5), (24.5, -6.5), etc.)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) with Inserter at Position (7.5, 5.5) feeding it\n- Belt Group connecting the Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions (e.g., (10.5, -1.5), (12.5, 1.5), etc.)\n\n### Iron Ore Storage at Position (-3.5, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 2.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) transferring items between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Inventory Items\n- Ensure that the required items are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, attempting to insert copper plates into an assembling machine without having them in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. This can be achieved by ensuring that the connected entities are producing or have the required items.\n\n### Errors when Furnaces have No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. This can be done by checking the input resources and refilling them as needed."}
