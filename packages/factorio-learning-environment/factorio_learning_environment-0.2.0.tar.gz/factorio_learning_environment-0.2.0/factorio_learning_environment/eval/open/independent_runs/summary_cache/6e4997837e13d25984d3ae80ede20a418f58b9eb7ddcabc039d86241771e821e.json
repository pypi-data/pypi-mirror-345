{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing 799 iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with 35 coal in its inventory and producing iron plates. The furnace is currently full and cannot produce more until the output is cleared.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently operational but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full. It is extracting iron ore from the Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Ensure to regularly empty the Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to allow the Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) to continue extracting iron ore.\n- Clear the output of the Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) to prevent it from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Errors when refueling\n- Make sure to have sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel the Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0). \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined yet.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore`: int (3023)\n  - `iron_plate`: int (100)\n  - `coal`: int (2)\n  - `wood`: int (4)"}
