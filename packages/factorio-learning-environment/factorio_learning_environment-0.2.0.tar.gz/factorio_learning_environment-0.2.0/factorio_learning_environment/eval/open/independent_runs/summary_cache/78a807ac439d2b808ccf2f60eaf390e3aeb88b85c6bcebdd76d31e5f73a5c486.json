{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the steam engine and boiler\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions providing electrical connections\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Connectivity\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established between entities like steam engines, boilers, and offshore pumps. Check that pipes are correctly connected to allow fluid flow.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Supply\n- Make sure that boilers have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Box Status\n- Verify that fluid boxes are not empty when they should be full. Ensure that the offshore pump is functioning and supplying water to the system.\n\n### Errors When Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement."}
