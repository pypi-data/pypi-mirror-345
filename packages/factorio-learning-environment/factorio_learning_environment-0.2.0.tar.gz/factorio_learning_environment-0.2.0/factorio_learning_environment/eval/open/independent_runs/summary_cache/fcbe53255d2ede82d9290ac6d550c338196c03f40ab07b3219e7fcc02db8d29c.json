{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore. It is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and another at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items, likely intended to move items between chests or into the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Ensure there is enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like furnaces or inserters. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Regularly check and clear out chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping. The warning \"chest at drop position is full\" indicates that the mining drill cannot continue extracting resources until the chest is emptied."}
