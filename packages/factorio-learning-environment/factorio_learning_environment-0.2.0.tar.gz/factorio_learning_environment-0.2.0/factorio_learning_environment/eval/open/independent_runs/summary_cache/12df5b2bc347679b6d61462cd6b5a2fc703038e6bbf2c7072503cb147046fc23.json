These iron plates are a critical resource for advanced crafting (such as Lab production) by enabling the supply chain for subsequent sub-ingredients.\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace dedicated to converting copper ore (with coal) into copper plates. The copper plates produced here support downstream processes including the production of copper cables and electronic components needed for complex items.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Misuse Errors:\n  - Call get_entities() using only the supported parameters. Avoid using unsupported keywords (e.g., omit 'radius') and ensure that the number of positional arguments matches the function\u2019s definition.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Issues:\n  - Before placing an entity (such as a Lab), verify that the corresponding item exists in the inventory to avoid placement failures at a designated location.\n\n\u2022 Iteration Over None:\n  - When filtering or processing entities returned from functions like get_entities(), ensure that the result is never None (initialize as an empty list if needed) so that iterations do not trigger TypeErrors.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Dependency Shortfalls:\n  - Confirm that all required sub-ingredients for complex items (for example, Lab crafting needing iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available. Review and secure the full production chain before initiating a craft.\n  \n\u2022 Fallback Handling:\n  - Incorporate robust checks when using fallback methods (e.g., when get_entities() fails) so that subsequent operations do not assume valid data were returned."}
