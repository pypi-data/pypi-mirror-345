{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent attempted to place several entities, but none were successfully placed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure the area is clear and buildable before attempting to place entities like Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts. Verify the buildability of a position before placing.\n\n### Errors due to lack of nearby entities for item insertion\n- When inserting items into an entity, ensure there is a nearby entity capable of accepting the items. Position entities correctly to facilitate item transfer.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the agent\n- Move closer to the intended placement area to ensure successful placement of entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check if the tile is occupied or restricted before placing an entity to avoid placement errors."}
