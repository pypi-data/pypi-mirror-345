{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (1.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 2.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing iron plates at positions (1.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 3.5)\n- Additional wooden chest at (5.5, 3.5) with burner inserter at (5.5, 2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line at (2.0, 7.0) and (4.0, 7.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (2.0, 7.0) and (4.0, 7.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (2.5, 8.5) and (4.5, 8.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing copper plates at positions (2.5, 9.5) and (4.5, 9.5)\n\n### Steam Power Plant at (2.5, 35.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (2.5, 35.5) providing water\n- Boiler at (7.0, 35.5)\n- Steam engine at (13.5, 35.5)\n- Two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes connecting offshore pump to boiler (system 1361)\n  - Steam pipes from boiler to engine (system 1364)\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nConsists of multiple electric poles forming an electricity group (id=153) spanning from coordinates (3.5, 13.5) to (13.5, 33.5)\n\n### Unused Offshore Pump\n- Standalone offshore pump at (-5.5, 26.5) not connected to any system\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check if the target location is free before placing new entities\n- The attempt to place a small electric pole at (13.5, 35.5) failed because there was already a steam engine at that location\n- Consider placing poles adjacent to, rather than directly on top of, other entities\n\n### Power system setup issues\n- Ensure proper spacing between power-related entities\n- Leave adequate space around large entities like steam engines for placing supporting infrastructure like power poles"}
