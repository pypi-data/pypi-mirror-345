{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -49.5) used for transferring items between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) used for storing items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items not present in inventory\n- Ensure that the items you are trying to insert are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors. For example, attempting to insert coal when none is available will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to entities running out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like furnaces and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up, or adjust the inserter's position to align with the source entity's output."}
