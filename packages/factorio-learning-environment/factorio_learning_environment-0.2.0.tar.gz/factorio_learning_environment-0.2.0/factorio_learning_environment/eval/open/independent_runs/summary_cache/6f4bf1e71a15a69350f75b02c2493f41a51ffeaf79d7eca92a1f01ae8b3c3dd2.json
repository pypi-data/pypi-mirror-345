Verify that the targeted fluid_system is correctly assigned and that a pipe group exists in proximity before attempting a connection.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Attribute Usage:\n  - Use only supported inventory attributes when accessing or modifying inventory items to prevent attribute-related errors.\n\n\u2022 Consistency in Connection Parameters:\n  - Cross-check the final entities log to ensure that the fluid_system identifiers and connection parameters remain consistent with the current map configuration, and adjust the search radius if necessary."}
