{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1**: Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with 20 units of coal, currently working, containing 4 iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- **Furnace 2**: Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with 22 units of coal, currently not working due to lack of ingredients, containing iron plates.\n- **Furnace 3**: Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with 39 units of coal, currently not working due to lack of ingredients, containing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction Site at Position (x=4.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: Positioned at (x=4.0, y=-60.0), currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at the drop position (x=4.5, y=-58.5). Contains iron ore resources.\n- **Wooden Chests**: Positioned at various coordinates around the drill, with the chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing 2 units of iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that chests used for storing extracted resources are not full to prevent mining operations from halting. Regularly check and empty chests to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from stopping unexpectedly. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to maintain operational efficiency.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to process. Monitor the input inventory of furnaces to avoid production halts due to missing ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: int, extracted from chests and inserted into furnaces.\n- `iron-plate`: int, produced by furnaces and stored in chests.\n- `coal`: int, used as fuel in furnaces.\n\nThis report summarizes the current state of the agent's structures and provides actionable tips to mitigate recurring errors."}
