{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) which is currently working and has a status of EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS. It has been inserted with coal and iron ore for smelting.\n\n### Stone furnace at position (2.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 1.0) which is currently working and has a status of EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS. It has been inserted with coal and copper ore for smelting.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors related to crafting and missing resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, stone is necessary for crafting a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when moving to a position with incorrect attribute access\n- When moving to a position, ensure that the attributes being accessed are correct. For example, avoid accessing 'x' directly from a 'BoundingBox' object, as it does not have this attribute.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces with conflicting contents\n- Ensure that you are not trying to insert a type of ore into a furnace that already contains a different type of ore. For example, do not insert iron ore into a furnace that already contains copper ore, and vice versa."}
