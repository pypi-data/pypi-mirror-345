{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll summarize the structures and error tips:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) facing down, mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -48.5) moving items from drill to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) smelting iron plates\n\nThe structure is set up as a production line with the mining drill extracting iron ore, the inserter moving it to the furnace, and the furnace smelting it into iron plates. All components have been fueled with coal.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too close together\n- When placing inserters next to other entities, ensure there is enough spacing and no entity collision\n- Consider using the spacing parameter when placing entities next to each other\n- Check that the target position is not already occupied by another entity\n\n### Errors with missing inventory items\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into entities\n- Check inventory for coal before trying to fuel entities\n- Verify you have all required ingredients before attempting to craft items\n\n### Errors with crafting requirements\n- Some items like iron plates cannot be crafted directly and require smelting in a furnace\n- Check recipe requirements and ensure you have the correct production method (crafting vs smelting)\n- Verify you have all prerequisite items before attempting to craft complex items\n\n### Errors with entity dimensions\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations directly on entity dimensions\n- Access the actual dimension values rather than the dimension objects when calculating positions"}
