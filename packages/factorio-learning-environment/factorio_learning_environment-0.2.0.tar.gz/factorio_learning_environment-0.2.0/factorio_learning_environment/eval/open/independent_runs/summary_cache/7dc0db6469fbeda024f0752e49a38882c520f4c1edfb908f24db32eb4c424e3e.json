{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent attempted several placements but was unable to successfully place any entities due to various constraints and errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type before attempting placement.\n- Verify that there are no hidden constraints or map-wide restrictions affecting placement.\n- Re-evaluate any potential global constraints that might be affecting the placement of entities.\n- Check game settings and restrictions that might prevent entity placement.\n\n### Errors related to potential global constraints\n- Investigate and resolve any global constraints or map issues that may be preventing the placement of entities.\n- Consider reviewing the game settings or map configuration to identify and address any persistent placement issues.\n\n### Errors during diagnostic tests\n- Ensure that the diagnostic tests are not conflicting with entity placement logic.\n- Review the diagnostic test setup to confirm it aligns with the intended placement strategy.\n\n### Errors with incorrect data types\n- Ensure that all indices and data types used in operations are appropriate and correctly formatted to avoid errors such as \"string indices must be integers.\"\n\nThese tips should help in mitigating the errors encountered during the placement attempts and improve the agent's efficiency in setting up structures on the map."}
