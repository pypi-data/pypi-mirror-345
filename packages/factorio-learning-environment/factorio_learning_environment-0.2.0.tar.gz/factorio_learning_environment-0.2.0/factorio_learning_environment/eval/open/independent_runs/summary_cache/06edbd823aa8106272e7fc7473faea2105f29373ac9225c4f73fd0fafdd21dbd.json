{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=0.5, y=23.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=7.5, y=23.5) and another Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, including underground pipes and regular pipes at various positions\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the correct type of pipes (e.g., UndergroundPipe, Pipe) are used and properly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that the connections are not obstructed or incorrectly aligned.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to fuel the boiler. Ensure that the inventory is checked and replenished regularly to avoid running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network Connection\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to the electric network. Ensure that the necessary electric poles and connections are in place to integrate the steam engine into the power grid.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `boiler`: Represents the boiler entity, which requires fuel to operate.\n  - `steam-engine`: Represents the steam engine entity, which needs to be connected to the electric network.\n  - `offshore-pump`: Represents the offshore pump entity, responsible for supplying water to the boiler.\n\nNote: The report is based on the latest execution steps, and no previous historical report was provided."}
