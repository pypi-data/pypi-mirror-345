{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction Site at Position (-21.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -52.0) extracting iron ore. It is currently out of fuel and its output is blocked due to the absence of a sink entity.\n\n### Coal-Powered Inserter Array\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -53.5) refueled with coal, awaiting source items. Connected to a transport belt group.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -52.5) refueled with coal, awaiting source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5) refueled with coal, awaiting source items. Connected to a stone furnace.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0), currently out of fuel and lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Transport Belt Systems\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5), currently empty.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) and (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5), currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when defining variables\n- Ensure that variables are correctly defined before use. For example, the 'mining_drill' variable was not defined, causing a NameError.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- When connecting entities such as belts, ensure that the correct intermediary entities like inserters are used. Direct connections from a stone furnace to belts are not possible.\n\n### Errors in finding suitable positions for entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and the correct conditions are met for placing entities like mining drills and wooden chests."}
