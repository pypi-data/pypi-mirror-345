{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -28.0, -61.0)\n- Stone furnace (position -27.0, -59.0)\n- Burner inserter (position -25.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden chest (position -24.5, -58.5) for collecting copper plates\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills with associated storage:\n- Mining drill 1 (position -10.0, -59.0) with wooden chest (position -9.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill 2 (position -8.0, -59.0) with wooden chest (position -7.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill 3 (position -6.0, -59.0) with wooden chest (position -5.5, -57.5)\nNote: All drills currently out of fuel\n\n### Iron Smelting Line (0, 0)\nLarge smelting setup consisting of:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- 4 Input burner inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- 4 Output burner inserters at positions (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- 4 Input wooden chests for coal at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- 4 Output wooden chests for iron plates at positions (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing inserters next to entities, ensure there is enough space and no collision with existing entities\n- Check if the target position is valid (not water or other unsuitable terrain)\n- Consider adjusting the spacing parameter when placing entities next to each other\n\n### Entity Pickup Errors\n- Verify the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up\n- Double check coordinates when trying to pick up entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drills are out of fuel - implement a fuel management system\n- Furnaces have no ingredients - ensure proper supply chain of materials\n\n### Entity Status Monitoring\n- Multiple inserters are in \"waiting for source items\" status - ensure proper material flow\n- Mining drill outputs are blocked - ensure proper output collection setup"}
