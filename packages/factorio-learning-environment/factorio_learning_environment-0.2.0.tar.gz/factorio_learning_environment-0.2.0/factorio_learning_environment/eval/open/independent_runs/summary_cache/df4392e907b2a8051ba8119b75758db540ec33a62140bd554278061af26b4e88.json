{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the structures and error tips.\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at position(x=35-41, y=-83 to -87)\nComplex mining setup consisting of:\n- 3 Burner mining drills at positions (37.0,-85.0), (39.0,-85.0), and (41.0,-86.0)\n- Storage chests at positions (34.5,-86.5), (36.5,-86.5), (40.5,-87.5), (39.5,-83.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (35.5,-86.5), (35.5,-85.5) connecting the components\nCurrent status: Drills are out of fuel, chests contain varying amounts of coal\n\n### Iron/Copper Ore Mining at position(x=-28, y=-61)\nMining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0,-61.0)\n- Storage chest at (-27.5,-59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0,-58.0)\n- Burner inserters at (-26.5,-59.5), (-25.5,-58.5) for material movement\nConnected to additional furnaces at (-23.0,-58.0), (-21.0,-58.0)\n\n### Iron Processing Line at position(x=-10 to -6, y=-59)\nProcessing line with:\n- 3 Burner mining drills at (-10.0,-59.0), (-8.0,-59.0), (-6.0,-59.0)\n- Storage chests at (-9.5,-57.5), (-7.5,-57.5), (-5.5,-57.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\nCurrent status: Drills need fuel, chests contain iron ore\n\n### Smelting Array at position(x=0 to 6, y=0)\nLarge smelting setup with:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at (0.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), (4.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), (6.5,2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters managing input/output\n\n### Power Generation System at position(x=-3.5 to 4.5, y=18-27)\nComplete power setup:\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5,27.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5,22.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5,20.5)\n- Connected pipe network for water/steam flow\nCurrent status: System is operational with proper fluid flow\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Ensure mining drills and inserters are fueled before they run out completely\n- Keep a steady supply of coal in the system to prevent work stoppages\n\n### Storage Management\n- Monitor chest capacity - full chests are blocking production at (-5.5,-55.5)\n- Implement better storage management or more frequent collection from storage chests\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Ensure transport belts have proper input/output connections before placing items\n- Clear blocked belts to maintain proper flow of materials\n\n### Fluid System Connectivity\n- Verify all fluid connections (pipes, pumps, boilers) are properly connected before starting operation\n- Monitor fluid levels to ensure consistent power generation"}
