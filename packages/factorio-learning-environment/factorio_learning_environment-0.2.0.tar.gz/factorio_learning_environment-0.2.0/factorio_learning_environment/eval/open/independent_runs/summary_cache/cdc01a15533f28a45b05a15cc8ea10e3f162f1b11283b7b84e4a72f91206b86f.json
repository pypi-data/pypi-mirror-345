{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target location is free before placing any entity like Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, or Transport Belt. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to incorrect locations\n- Verify the destination is valid and unoccupied before moving entities like Stone Furnace. This will avoid errors related to entity placement.\n\n### Errors when extracting or interacting with non-existent entities\n- Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position.\"\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from production entities like Burner Mining Drill to avoid blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Regularly check and supply necessary ingredients to production entities like Stone Furnace to prevent warnings related to missing ingredients."}
