For example, the boiler could not be placed at (-46.5, -123.5) due to an obstruction.\n\n### Errors with Function Arguments\n- When using functions such as `pickup_entity`, ensure that all arguments are of the correct type. For instance, the second argument must be a Position object to avoid a ValueError."}
