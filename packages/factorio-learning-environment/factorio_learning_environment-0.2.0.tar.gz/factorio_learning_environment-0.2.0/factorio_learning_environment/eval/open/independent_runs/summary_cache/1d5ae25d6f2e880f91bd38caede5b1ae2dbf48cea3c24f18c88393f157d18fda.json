{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore. The drill is currently waiting for space in the destination chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore. \n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the chest at (-14.5, -54.5) to another chest at (-12.5, -54.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-16.5, -64.5) and (-20.5, -63.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Multiple **BeltGroups** connecting various mining drills, furnaces, and chests across the map to facilitate the movement of resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### NameError: Undefined Class 'Chest'\n- Ensure that the class 'Chest' is defined or imported correctly before using it in your code. Consider checking the available classes in the 'factorio_entities' module.\n\n### AttributeError: Incorrect Attribute Access\n- When accessing attributes of an object, ensure that the object is of the correct type and has the attribute you are trying to access. In this case, ensure that 'chest' is an object with a 'value' attribute, or adjust your code to access the correct attribute.\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping due to lack of space in destination chests. Consider setting up automated systems to transfer items from full chests to other storage or processing units.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items to prevent them from idling. Check the connectivity and availability of items in the source containers.\n\nBy addressing these errors and optimizing your setup, you can improve the efficiency of your production lines and resource management in the game."}
