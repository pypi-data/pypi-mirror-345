{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that converts iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the produced iron plates.\nUpdates:\n- Steps 38\u201347: Produced and extracted multiple batches of iron plates with fuel and resource adjustments; experienced a temporary halt due to insufficient raw materials.\n- Steps 48\u201349: \n   \u2022 Located and harvested an additional 10 iron ore from the patch at (-15.5, -50.5) and inserted them into the furnace.\n   \u2022 Furnace inventory updated post-insertion to include 19 iron ore and 1 iron plate.\n   \u2022 After waiting 10 seconds, inventory adjusted to 14 iron ore and 5 iron plates, with 5 iron plates subsequently extracted.\n   \u2022 Final map state reports a furnace with 25 coal as fuel, an accumulated count of 15 iron plates in processing output, and a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\" (indicating intermittent resource delays).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resource availability and inventory mismanagement\n- Confirm resource presence and necessary quantities in inventory before insertion into processing structures to prevent intermittent halts.\n\n### Errors related to processing timing and ingredient replenishment delays\n- Align waiting intervals with processing cycles. Monitor and replenish ingredients in a timely manner to avoid warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Repeated mistakes with stale entity status data\n- Always update entity inventories and states after each operation to ensure that processing decisions are based on the most current map data."}
