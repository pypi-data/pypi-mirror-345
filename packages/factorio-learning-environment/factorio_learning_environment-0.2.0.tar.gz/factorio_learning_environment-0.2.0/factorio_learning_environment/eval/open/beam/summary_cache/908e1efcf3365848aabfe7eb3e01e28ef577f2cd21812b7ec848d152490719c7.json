{"content": "The error indicates that the assembling machine is not powered, and there is no nearby small electric pole to connect it. To resolve this, we need to place a new electric pole to power the assembling machine. Here\u2019s how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Place a Small Electric Pole**: We need to place a new small electric pole near the assembling machine to ensure it is powered.\n2. **Connect the Pole to the Power Network**: Ensure the new pole is connected to the existing power network.\n\nLet's implement these steps:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Resolving power issue by placing a new electric pole.\")\n\n# Step 1: Move to the assembling machine to place the electric pole nearby.\nmove_to(assembling_machine.position)\n\n# Step 2: Place a new small electric pole near the assembling machine.\n# Assume we have small electric poles in the inventory.\npole_position = assembling_machine.position.right().right()\nnew_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, direction=Direction.UP, position=pole_position)\nprint(f\"Placed a new small electric pole at position {pole_position}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Connect the new pole to the assembling machine.\nconnect_entities(new_pole, assembling_machine)\nprint(\"Connected the new electric pole to the assembling machine.\")\n\n# Step 4: Ensure the new pole is connected to the power network.\n# Move to the nearest existing power pole to connect them.\nexisting_power_pole_position = find_nearest_power_pole()\nif existing_power_pole_position:\n    move_to(existing_power_pole_position)\n    connect_entities(new_pole, existing_power_pole_position)\n    print(\"Connected the new electric pole to the existing power network.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No existing power pole found.
