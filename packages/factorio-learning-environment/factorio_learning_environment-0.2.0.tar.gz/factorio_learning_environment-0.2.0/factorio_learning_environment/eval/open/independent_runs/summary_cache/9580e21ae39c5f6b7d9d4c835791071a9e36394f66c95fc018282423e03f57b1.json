{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - working, producing water\n- Boiler (x=-6.5, y=0.0) - fueled with coal (14 remaining), producing steam\n- Steam engine (x=-2.5, y=0.5) - working, connected to power network\n- Pipe network (system 2351/2352) connecting all components\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - powered and working, producing crude oil\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - powered, showing FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE despite crude oil input\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - empty\n- Chemical plant (x=37.5, y=40.5) - powered, showing ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE (needs coal)\n- Wooden chest with coal (x=37.5, y=37.5) - contains 140 coal\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - powered but pickup/drop positions reversed\n- Connected pipe network from pumpjack to refinery (system 2358)\n- New power poles connecting facilities at positions:\n  - (0.0, 0.0)\n  - (5.0, 0.0)\n  - (10.0, 0.0)\n  - (15.0, 0.0)\n  - (17.5, 20.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent refinery connection issues\n- Refinery still shows FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE despite connected pumpjack (steps 40-47):\n  - Verify crude oil input connection at x=28.5 y=43.5 is properly linked\n  - Check pipe network continuity from pumpjack to refinery\n  - Ensure refinery input connection point is correctly configured for crude oil\n\n### Chemical plant configuration problems\n- Inserter still incorrectly configured (pickup/drop reversed):\n  - Reconfigure inserter to move coal from chest (x=37.5 y=37.5) to chemical plant (x=37.5 y=40.5)\n  - Verify inserter direction and pickup/drop positions\n\n### Power pole placement errors\n- Repeated placement attempts while too far away (step 45) or on occupied tiles (steps 46-47):\n  - Always move within 10 tiles before placing entities\n  - Verify position is clear before placement attempts\n  - Check for existing entities at target location\n\n### Empty source connection attempts\n- Continuing attempts to connect empty storage tank to chemical plant (steps 42-44):\n  - Wait until refinery produces petroleum gas before connecting downstream\n  - Verify fluid presence before connection attempts\n\n### Inventory management\n- Attempted to insert coal with empty inventory (step 44):\n  - Monitor coal inventory levels\n  - Keep minimum coal reserve for power generation and production\n\n### Previous errors still applicable:\n- Power network verification (check all poles between facilities)\n- Production monitoring (verify refinery output before connecting downstream)\n- Entity inspection (check fluid contents before connection attempts)"}
