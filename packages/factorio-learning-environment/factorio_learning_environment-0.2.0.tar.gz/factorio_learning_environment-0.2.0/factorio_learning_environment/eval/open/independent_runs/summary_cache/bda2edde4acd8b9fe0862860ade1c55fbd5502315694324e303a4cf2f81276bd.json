{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5). The drill is actively mining iron ore and has a warning indicating that its output is blocked by an item on the ground.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace is currently in a status of \"NO_INGREDIENTS,\" indicating it lacks iron ore to smelt into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid locations\n- **Burner Inserter Placement**: Ensure the desired location for placing a Burner Inserter is unoccupied and valid. This error occurred multiple times.\n- **Wooden Chest Placement**: Verify that the location for placing a Wooden Chest is not occupied by other entities or items. This error was noted at the drill's drop position.\n- **Transport Belt Placement**: Confirm that the target location for placing a Transport Belt is clear and suitable for placement.\n\n### Errors related to entity retrieval\n- **Stone Furnace Retrieval**: When attempting to retrieve a Stone Furnace entity, ensure the specified position is correct and that a Stone Furnace exists there. This error was encountered when trying to get the Stone Furnace at various positions.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- **Burner Mining Drill Output Blockage**: Address the warning of output blockage by ensuring there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to receive the mined resources from the drill.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check entity positions and ensure they are not obstructed by other items or entities.\n- Maintain a clear path for resource flow from mining drills to furnaces to prevent output blockages.\n- Ensure all entities have the necessary ingredients or resources to function efficiently."}
