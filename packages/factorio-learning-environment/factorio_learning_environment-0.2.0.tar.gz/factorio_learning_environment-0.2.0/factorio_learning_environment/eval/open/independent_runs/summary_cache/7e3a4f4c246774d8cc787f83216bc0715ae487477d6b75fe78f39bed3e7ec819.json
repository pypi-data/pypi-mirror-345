{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a network of transport belts and a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore extraction and transportation.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0) for smelting iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore extraction.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) for transferring iron ore to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Processing at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing various items including coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items between chests.\n\n### Transport Belt Networks\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups for transporting materials between various entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5) and (-21.5, -67.5) to (-21.5, -69.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-18.5, -71.5) to (-16.5, -71.5).\n- Additional BeltGroups facilitating movement of resources across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Ensure that all objects and their attributes are correctly defined and accessible. For example, the 'BeltGroup' object should have an 'output_position' attribute if it is being referenced in the code.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to source items. Ensure that the source entities are correctly positioned and stocked with items to be transferred.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the input sources and supply lines to maintain a steady flow of raw materials to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belts\n- Ensure that transport belts are correctly connected and aligned to facilitate the smooth movement of items. Check for any misalignments or breaks in the belt network."}
