{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Connected to a wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) for iron ore storage.\n- **Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: No ingredients\n    - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: No ingredients\n    - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: Full output\n    - Warnings: Furnace result is full\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (7.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (6.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (9.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (8.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore\n  - Chest at position (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Overflow Issues\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is regularly emptied to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Furnace Output Blockage\n- Regularly extract the smelted iron plates from the furnaces to prevent them from reaching full output status and halting production.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Shortage\n- Ensure a continuous supply of iron ore to the furnaces to maintain their operation and prevent them from running out of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `Inventory`: A dictionary tracking the player's current inventory items, such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
