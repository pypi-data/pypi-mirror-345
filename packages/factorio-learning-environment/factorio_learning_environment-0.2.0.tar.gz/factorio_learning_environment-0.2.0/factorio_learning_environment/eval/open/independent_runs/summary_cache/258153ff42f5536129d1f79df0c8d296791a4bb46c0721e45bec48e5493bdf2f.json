{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5), (8.5, 1.5), (17.5, 1.5), (19.5, 1.5).\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), (20.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 17.5) not connected to any fluid source.\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 22.0) out of fuel.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) working and connected to a series of pipes.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (-2.5, 20.5) with status EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 21.5) with status EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, transporting water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, providing voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Verify that all necessary connections are made and that there are no gaps in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- Verify the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting to retrieve them. Ensure that the entity type matches the expected prototype.\n\n### Inserter Errors\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items and that their pickup and drop positions are correctly configured. Check that the source container has items available for the inserter to pick up.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to maintain continuous operation."}
