{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n- Burner mining drill extracting coal\n- Connected to two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n- Currently out of fuel\n\n### Iron Smelting System 1 (around y=-81.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) feeding the furnaces\n- Wooden chest at (46.5, -83.5) for input storage\n- Both furnaces have fuel (50 coal each) but no ingredients\n\n### Iron Smelting System 2 (around y=-78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two burner inserters at (46.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5)\n- Input wooden chest at (46.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Both inserters configured to move items from chest to furnaces\n\n### Storage Area\nMultiple chests for resource storage:\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 800 coal\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Various other wooden chests for temporary storage\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n1. Inserter Configuration Issues\n   - Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly set before building\n   - Double check inserter directions match the intended material flow\n   - When rebuilding inserters, verify all parameters (position, direction, pickup/drop points) in one operation\n\n2. System Design Issues\n   - Ensure fuel supply is maintained for burner mining drills\n   - Consider connecting storage systems to prevent resource bottlenecks\n   - Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow conditions\n\n# NAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\nFunctions:\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\nThe logs show primarily entity manipulation and system status checking rather than function definitions or variable assignments."}
