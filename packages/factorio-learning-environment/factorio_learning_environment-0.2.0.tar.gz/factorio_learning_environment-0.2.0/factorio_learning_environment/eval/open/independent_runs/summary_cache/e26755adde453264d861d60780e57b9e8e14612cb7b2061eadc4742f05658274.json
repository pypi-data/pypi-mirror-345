{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Collection System at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-16.5, -51.5) that transfers mined iron ore to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) for storing mined iron ore\n- Additional Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -51.5) that is intended to transfer items from the wooden chest at position (-13.5, -51.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting System at Position (62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (63.5, -52.5) intended to insert iron ore into the furnace\n\n### Iron Ore Collection Chest at Position (-13.5, -51.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -51.5) intended to collect iron ore from the inserter\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing burner inserters\n- Ensure the target location for placing a burner inserter is clear of obstructions. Repeated attempts to place a burner inserter at (61.0, -53.0) failed due to obstructions.\n\n### Errors in connecting belts\n- When attempting to connect belts, ensure that the source and destination are compatible entities. An error occurred when trying to connect belts directly from a wooden chest, which requires an inserter instead.\n\n### Errors with inserter operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to pick up and drop items. Adjust the pickup and drop positions if necessary to avoid errors related to inserter operations.\n\n### Fuel and Resource Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like furnaces and mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations."}
