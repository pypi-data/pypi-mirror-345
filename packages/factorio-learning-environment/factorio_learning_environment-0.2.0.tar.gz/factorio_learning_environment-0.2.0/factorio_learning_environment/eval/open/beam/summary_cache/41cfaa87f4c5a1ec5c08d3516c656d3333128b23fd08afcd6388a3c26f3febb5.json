{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 0.0)\n\nThese furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Both furnaces are currently fueled with coal and have been producing iron plates. However, they are currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is crafted and available in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace or assembling machine without having them in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to missing crafting prerequisites\n- Before crafting an item, ensure all prerequisite items and technologies are available. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires stone, which must be gathered first. Similarly, crafting an assembling machine requires the automation technology to be researched.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into incompatible furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace is empty or contains compatible materials before inserting new materials. Attempting to insert copper ore into a furnace already containing iron ore will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities without the items\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item you wish to extract. Attempting to extract copper plates from a furnace that only contains iron plates will lead to an error."}
