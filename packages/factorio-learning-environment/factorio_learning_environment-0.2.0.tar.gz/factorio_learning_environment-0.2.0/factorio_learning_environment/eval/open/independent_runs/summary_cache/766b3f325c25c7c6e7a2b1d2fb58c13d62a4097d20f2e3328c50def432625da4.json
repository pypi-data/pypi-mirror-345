{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5). It is currently working and has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) containing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) moving items to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) actively working, converting iron ore to iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5) moving items to the furnace.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in the inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. In this case, the agent attempted to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and clear storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full and halting production processes.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Failed when attempting to insert coal without having it in the inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `mining_drill`: Represents a mining drill entity, type: Entity.\n  - `inventory`: Represents the agent's current inventory, type: Dict[str, int]."}
