Check for other entities that might be obstructing the connection.\n\n### Errors when using attributes of entities\n- Verify that the attributes you are trying to access on an entity are valid. For example, the 'PipeGroup' object does not have a 'direction' attribute. Always check the documentation for the correct attributes available for each entity type.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check the surrounding area for any existing entities that may block placement."}
