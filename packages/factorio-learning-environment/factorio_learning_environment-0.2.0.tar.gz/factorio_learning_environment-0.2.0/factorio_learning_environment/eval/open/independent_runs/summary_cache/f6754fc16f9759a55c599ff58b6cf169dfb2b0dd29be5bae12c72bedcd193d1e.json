{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5)\n- Small electric poles (multiple positions including (-11.5, 26.5), (-16.5, 18.5), (-6.5, 15.5), etc.)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure there are no obstructing entities in the path when attempting to connect pipes. Check for placement blockages and remove any obstructing pipes or entities before reconnecting.\n\n### Errors when using electric networks\n- Make sure that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the electricity network. Check the status of electric poles and ensure they are within range of the entities that need power.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position to avoid placement blockage.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect entities\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and that there are no other entities blocking the connection."}
