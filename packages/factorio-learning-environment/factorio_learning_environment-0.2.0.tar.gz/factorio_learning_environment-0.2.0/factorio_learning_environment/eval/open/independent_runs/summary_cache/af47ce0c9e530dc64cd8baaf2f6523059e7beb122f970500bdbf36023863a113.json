{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Contains: Iron Ore (792 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Pickup from: Wooden Chest\n  - Drop to: Furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Contains: Iron Plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter Pickup and Drop Positions\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest and the drop position aligns with the furnace. This will prevent the inserter from failing to transfer items.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- When placing entities like inserters, ensure there is no collision with existing entities or unsuitable terrain. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Refueling\n- Before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills or inserters, ensure that you have sufficient resources (e.g., coal) in your inventory to complete the action.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Regularly check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly aligned and fueled to transfer materials into the furnace. This will prevent the furnace from running without ingredients to smelt."}
