{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n- **Furnace** at position (6.0, -60.0)\n- **Furnace** at position (8.0, -60.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (4.5, -57.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, -57.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (8.5, -57.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (10.5, -59.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n#### Coal Mining Facility at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (42.0, -83.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (45.0, -83.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (45.5, -80.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (42.5, -79.5) for storing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (45.5, -79.5) for storing coal.\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage Facility at position (14.5, -59.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (14.5, -59.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (16.5, -59.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (18.5, -59.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (20.5, -59.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (15.5, -59.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (17.5, -59.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (19.5, -59.5)\n\n#### Belt Groups\n- **Belt Group** connecting (43.5, -81.5) to (41.5, -79.5) for coal transport.\n- **Belt Group** connecting (46.5, -81.5) to (44.5, -79.5) for coal transport.\n- **Belt Group** connecting (11.5, -60.5) to (13.5, -59.5) for iron plate transport.\n- **Belt Group** connecting (14.5, -58.5) to (11.5, -58.5) for iron plate transport.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like **Wooden Chests** or **Burner Inserters**.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without required raw materials\n- Always gather raw resources like **wood** before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use **Inserters** to transfer items between chests and belts instead of trying to connect belts directly to chests.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into full inventories\n- Check the inventory capacity of entities like **Inserters** or **Chests** before attempting to insert items to avoid overflow.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are blocked\n- Clear transport belts at the drop positions of mining drills to ensure they can continue mining. For example, clear the belt at (42.5, -81.5) for the drill at (42.0, -83.0).\n\n#### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables like `furnaces` are defined before using them in your code to avoid `NameError`.\n\n#### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure the source entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) have items available for inserters to pick up."}
