# RadCompressor: Radial compressor mean-line model

Mean-line (1D) model for evaluating radial compressors. The code is adapted
from the version developed by Schiffmann and Favrat[^1], and was used to generate
a turbo-compressor dataset for *DATED*.

## Datasets

The dataset related to *DATED* is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8200792).

## Using the model

### Installation

To install this package, first make sure that you have Python >= 3.9 installed in your environment. If not, we
recommend to install Python using [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyrilpic/radcomp
cd radcomp
pip install .
```

If you want to install all dependencies to use the dataset generation scripts:

```bash
pip install .[generate]
```

### Basic Usage

A step-by-step example is provided in the [EvaluateCompressor.ipynb notebook](notebooks/EvaluateCompressor.ipynb).
