Errors arose when wooden chests, pipes, or transport belts blocked the candidate positions. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference points to find a clear tile.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Placement and Fueling Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that chosen buildable areas are free from water or obstructions before placing steam engines. Several placement attempts failed due to overlapping water or entity footprints.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify proximity to appropriate fuel-receiving entities when inserting coal; reposition as needed to overcome insertion failures.\n\n\u2022 Boiler and Pipe Connection Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-calculate buildable areas for boilers and confirm they are unobstructed. Inventory shortages (e.g. missing boilers) must be remedied by crafting before attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 When linking boilers to steam engines via pipes, ensure candidate positions are clear of other entities such as pipes, inserters, or furnaces. Increase spacing or alter directional parameters to avoid collisions.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Use correctly defined and consistent variable names. Errors referencing undefined variables (e.g. \u2018pole_up\u2019 or \u2018pole_from_engine\u2019) indicate the need for careful variable management.\n\n\u2022 General Inventory and Buildability Checks:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that required items (such as boilers) are available in the inventory prior to placement attempts.\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-check buildability of target tiles to avoid obstructions from existing entities or terrain features.\n\u2003\u2013 Retain previous tips regarding segmented pipe connections, crafting prerequisites, research requirements, movement/positioning constraints, and careful entity retrieval/repositioning, as these remain applicable."}
