If you receive an error stating \"No copper-plate to insert from your inventory,\" it indicates that your inventory is empty of that item.\n\n- **Errors when transferring items to a full chest**\n  - If you encounter an error stating \"Chest is full; cannot transfer copper plates,\" check the chest's inventory before attempting to transfer items. Ensure there is enough space in the chest to accommodate the items being transferred.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `craft_item(item_type)`: This function has failed multiple times due to insufficient copper plates.\n  - `insert_item(item_type, target_entity, quantity)`: This function has failed due to no available copper plates in the player's inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `copper_plate_count`: int\n  - `current_inventory`: dict\n  - `furnace_inventory`: dict\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict"}
