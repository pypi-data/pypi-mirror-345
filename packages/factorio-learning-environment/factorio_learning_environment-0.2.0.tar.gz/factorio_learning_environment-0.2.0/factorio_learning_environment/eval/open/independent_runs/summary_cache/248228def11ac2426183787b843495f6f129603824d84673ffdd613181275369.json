{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroups connecting these entities:\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=46219) at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=46220) at Position (-45.5, -122.5)\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=46226) at Position (-46.5, -120.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to Small Electric Poles at Positions (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at Position (not specified), currently not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly defined before use. The error \"NameError: name 'Entity' is not defined\" suggests that the 'Entity' class or object was not properly imported or declared.\n\n### Errors with Obstructions\n- Avoid placing entities where there are obstructions. The log indicates repeated obstruction errors at Position (-46.5, -121.5). Ensure that the area is clear before placing new structures.\n\n### Power Connectivity Issues\n- Ensure that all electrical components are connected to a power network. The steam engine and inserter are not connected to a power network, resulting in warnings about lack of power.\n\n### Fluid Connectivity Issues\n- Make sure that all fluid connections are properly established. The boiler and steam engine have warnings about \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\". Check all pipe connections and ensure they are correctly aligned and connected."}
