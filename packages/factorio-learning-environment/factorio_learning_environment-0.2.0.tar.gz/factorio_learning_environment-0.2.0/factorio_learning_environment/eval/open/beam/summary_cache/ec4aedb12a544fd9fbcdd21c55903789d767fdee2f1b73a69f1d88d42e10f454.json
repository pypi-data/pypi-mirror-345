{"content": "Based on the repeated output of only the initial print statement (\"Starting detailed diagnostic procedure...\"), it seems that the script is not progressing past this point. This suggests that the script may be encountering an issue early in its execution, possibly during the retrieval of entities or even before any significant operations are attempted. Here are some troubleshooting steps and suggestions to help identify and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Entity Retrieval**: Ensure that the `get_entities` function is correctly implemented and that the game environment contains the expected entities. If the entities are not being retrieved, the script will not proceed.\n\n2. **Add Immediate Debugging Prints**: Add print statements immediately after each `get_entities` call to confirm that entities are being retrieved and to check their counts. This will help identify where the script might be failing.\n\n3. **Check for Silent Failures**: If there are any conditions or exceptions that are being silently caught and not logged, ensure that they are being printed. This includes checking that the exception handling block is correctly set up to capture and display any errors.\n\n4. **Environment Setup**: Double-check that the Factorio environment is correctly set up with all necessary entities. If the environment is not set up correctly, the entities might not be found, leading to the script not advancing.\n\n5. **Simplify Initial Steps**: Temporarily simplify the script to only perform basic operations (e.g., just print entity counts) to isolate where the issue might be occurring.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the script with additional debugging prints:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting detailed diagnostic procedure...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Retrieve and print the number of each type of entity found\n    offshore_pumps = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    print(f\"Number of Offshore Pumps found: {len(offshore_pumps)}\")\n\n    boilers = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    print(f\"Number of Boilers found: {len(boilers)}\")\n\n    steam_engines = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    print(f\"Number of Steam Engines found: {len(steam_engines)}\")\n\n    electric_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    print(f\"Number of Electric Poles found: {len(electric_poles)}\")\n\n    assembling_machines = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n    print(f\"Number of Assembling Machines found: {len(assembling_machines)}\")\n\n    # Check if all entities are present\n    if not offshore_pumps:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Offshore Pump not found!\")\n    if not boilers:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Boiler not found!\")\n    if not steam_engines:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Steam Engine not found!\")\n    if not electric_poles:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Electric Pole not found!\")\n    if not assembling_machines:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Assembling Machine not found!\")\n\n    print(\"All necessary entities are present.\")\n\nexcept AssertionError as ae:\n    print(f\"Entity Retrieval Error: {ae}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Unexpected Diagnostic Error: {e}\")\n```\n\nBy simplifying the script and focusing on entity retrieval and basic checks, you should be able to identify where the issue is occurring. Once you have confirmed that entities are being retrieved correctly, you can gradually reintroduce more complex logic.", "summary_range": "[1-328]"}
