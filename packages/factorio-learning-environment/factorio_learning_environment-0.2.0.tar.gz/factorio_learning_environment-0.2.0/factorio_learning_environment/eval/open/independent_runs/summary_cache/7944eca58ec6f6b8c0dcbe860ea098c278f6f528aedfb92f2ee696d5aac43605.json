{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (x=1-5, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- 3 stone furnaces at positions (1,1), (3,1), and (5,1)\n- 3 burner inserters at positions (1.5,2.5), (3.5,2.5), and (5.5,2.5)\n- 3 wooden chests at positions (1.5,3.5), (3.5,3.5), and (5.5,3.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (x=2-4.5, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- 2 stone furnaces at positions (2,7) and (4,7)\n- 2 burner inserters at positions (2.5,8.5) and (4.5,8.5)\n- 2 wooden chests at positions (2.5,9.5) and (4.5,9.5)\n\n### Electronic Circuit Production Setup (x=11.5-21.5, y=11.5-15.5)\nConsists of:\n- Copper cable assembling machine at (14.5,14.5)\n- Electronic circuit assembling machine at (21.5,15.5)\n- Input chest for copper plates at (14.5,11.5)\n- Output chest for copper cables at (11.5,14.5)\n- Input chest for electronic circuits at (21.5,12.5)\n- Output chest for electronic circuits at (21.5,11.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters connecting these components at positions (14.5,12.5), (12.5,14.5), and (21.5,13.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-5.5-13.5, y=26.5-35.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (2.5,35.5)\n- Boiler at (7.0,35.5)\n- Steam engine at (13.5,35.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Electric pole network distributing power\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- When placing inserters next to buildings, ensure proper spacing and direction parameters\n- Consider using different spacing values when the default spacing results in conflicts\n\n### Fluid System Issues\n- One offshore pump at (-5.5,26.5) is not connected to any fluid system\n- Ensure all fluid-carrying entities are properly connected via pipes\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- The copper cable assembler has output blocking issues - ensure proper item flow with working inserters\n- The electronic circuit assembler shows resource shortages - ensure consistent supply of both iron plates and copper cables\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Ensure electric poles are properly connected to form a continuous network for power distribution\n- Keep track of power consumption and generation capacity"}
