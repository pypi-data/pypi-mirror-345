{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -25.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid. The boiler is out of fuel and has no input liquid as well.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nThe lab is designed to process automation science packs but is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nThe assembling machine is set to create automation science packs but is currently not receiving power and lacks the necessary resources (copper plate and iron gear wheel).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect boiler to offshore pump\n- Ensure there are no blockages in the path between the boiler and offshore pump before attempting to connect pipes.\n\n### Errors when connecting steam engine to boiler\n- Check for placement blockages before trying to connect pipes from the steam engine to the boiler.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Ensure that electric poles are not already occupied before attempting to place a new electric pole. Remove any existing entities at the target position before placing a new one.\n\n### Errors when entities are not receiving power\n- Verify that all power connections are correctly established and that there are no interruptions in the power network."}
