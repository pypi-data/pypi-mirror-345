{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Storage chest (x=23.5, y=-16.5) containing 38 coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Storage chest (x=-14.5, y=21.5) containing 116 iron ore\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (-10.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces (x=-11.0, y=20.0 and x=-9.0, y=20.0)\nBoth furnaces have 23 coal as fuel but are currently idle\n\n### Copper Production Line at (22.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill for copper ore (x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Storage chest (x=20.5, y=21.5) containing 12 copper ore\n- Burner inserter (x=21.5, y=21.5)\n- Stone furnace (x=24.0, y=20.0) with 20 coal as fuel and 6 copper plates\n- Output inserter (x=24.5, y=18.5)\n- Output storage chest (x=24.5, y=17.5) containing 24 copper plates\n- Belt system connecting components:\n  - Belt group 1: From y=17.5 to y=21.5\n  - Belt group 2: From x=22.5 to x=26.5\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Ensure mining drills have fuel before operation - multiple drills are showing \"out of fuel\" warnings\n- Keep track of coal supply and maintain adequate fuel levels in all burner devices\n\n### Entity Placement and Connection Issues\n- The burner inserter at (21.5, 21.5) has no valid output destination - ensure proper connection between components\n- When building production lines, verify that all entities are properly connected with appropriate input/output paths\n\n### Resource Management\n- The furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - ensure proper supply chain of raw materials\n- Verify that inserters can reach both their pickup and drop positions when placing them\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor coal levels in inventory to avoid \"No coal to insert\" errors\n- Maintain sufficient resources in inventory for refueling operations"}
