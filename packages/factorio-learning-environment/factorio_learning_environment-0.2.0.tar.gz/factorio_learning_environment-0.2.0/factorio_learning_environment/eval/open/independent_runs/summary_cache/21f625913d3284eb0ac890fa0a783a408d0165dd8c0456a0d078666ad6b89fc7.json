{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace\nUse-case: Processes iron ore into iron plates with an integrated collection point for direct resource storage and management.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resource availability\n- Verify that the target entity (e.g., furnace) and inventory hold the required resources before attempting insertion. Ensure that iron ore is available prior to initiating the smelting process.\n  \n### Errors related to timing in processing cycles\n- Allow sufficient time for the processing cycle to complete so that outputs become available, avoiding premature extraction or insertion attempts.\n  \n### Repeated mistakes with resource assertions\n- Confirm resource levels beforehand to prevent assertion failures. Check inventories and resource patches to guarantee that the required amounts (e.g., at least 10 iron ore) are accessible prior to smelting operations."}
