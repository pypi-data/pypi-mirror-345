{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at (15.5, 70.5) - UPDATED\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) producing 42 iron ore per minute\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 72.5) containing 44 iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (15.5, 73.5) with output blocked by ground items\n- Stone furnace at (16.0, 76.0) with no ingredients despite chest contents\n- Small electric pole at (13.5, 70.5) providing power\n- Current configuration shows alignment issues between inserter drop (15.5, 74.5) and furnace input (16.0, 76.0)\n\n### Power generation setup at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) operational (99.95 water)\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 3.5) with 3 coal remaining\n- Steam engine at (-0.5, 3.5) generating 13500.0 energy\n- Pipe network fully functional with water temperature at 15\u00b0C and steam at 165\u00b0C\n- Power pole network properly connected at 5964000 voltage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent inserter-furnace alignment issues (critical)\n- Inserter drop position (15.5,74.5) doesn't reach furnace input (16.0,76.0) - adjust positions to be adjacent\n- Output blocked warnings continue (8 total occurrences) - verify clear path from inserter to furnace\n\n### Furnace operation problems (updated)\n- No ingredients reaching furnace despite chest contents (7 total occurrences)\n- Verify inserter fuel and orientation (burner inserter has 9 coal)\n- Check furnace fuel supply (currently has 20 coal)\n\n### Entity placement verification\n- Repeated placement of same entities without fixing alignment (6 total occurrences)\n- Clear ground items before testing configurations (4 corrections made)\n\n### Power system monitoring\n- Boiler fuel running low (3 coal remaining) - maintain at least 10 coal buffer\n- Steam engine operating at full capacity (13500 energy)\n\n### Production diagnostics\n- Iron ore accumulation in chest indicates smelting bottleneck\n- Throughput remains at 42 iron ore/minute despite repeated adjustments\n\n### Configuration testing protocol\n- Test changes for full production cycle before making new adjustments\n- Verify all entity connections after placement (5 missed verifications)"}
