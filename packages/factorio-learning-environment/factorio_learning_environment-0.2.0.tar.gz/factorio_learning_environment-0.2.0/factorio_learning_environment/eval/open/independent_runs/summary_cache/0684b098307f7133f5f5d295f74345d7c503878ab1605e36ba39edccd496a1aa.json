{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) for coal collection\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) for iron ore collection\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (-10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-9.0, 20.0)\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Complex at (22, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) with wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n- Additional copper ore storage chest at (22.5, 21.5)\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing copper plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters near existing structures\n- Before placing inserters, verify that the target position is completely clear of other entities\n- When placing inserters near furnaces, ensure there is a one-tile gap between the inserter and the furnace\n- Consider the tile dimensions of both the inserter (1x1) and the target structure when planning placement\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple machines are showing \"out of fuel\" warnings - implement a fuel distribution system\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper input material flow\n- Consider implementing automated fuel and material feeding systems using inserters and belts"}
