# manage ray cluster setup

"""
Why?
Setting up a cluster involves a lot of state and resource management
for different users the resources created during cluster setup can
include:
- Kuberay Cluster
- Portforwarding Server
- packaged zips
- ray context initialization

There are three issues:
1. We want to make sure the api for setting up a cluster is simple, which
means everything should be in a single place instead of requiring a bunch
of different context managers to be created. Consider
```python
with(
    KuberayCluster(),
    PortforwardingServer(),
    PackagedZips(),
    RayContextInit()
):
    # do something with the cluster
)
```
We do not want to require the user to do this. However if we keep everything
in a single context manager a second issue arises.

2. We want to make sure that the resources are cleaned up when the context
manager exits, that includes when resource setup fails. Doing this in a single
context manager is difficult. Consider
```python
def __enter__(self):
    try:
        do_kuberay_cluster_setup()
    except Exception as e:
        # cleanup resources
        raise e

    try:
        start_portforwarding_server()
    except Exception as e:
        # cleanup resources
        raise e

    ...

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    try:
        shutdown_ray_context()
    except Exception as e:
        # cleanup resources
        raise e

    try:
        shutdown_portforwarding_server()
    except Exception as e:
        # cleanup resources
        raise e

    ...
```

3. Users may want start at any one of the following points:
  - only has k8s + kuberay installed
  - has a ray cluster
  - has dependency already setup in the ray cluster
  We need a way to allow users to start at any one of these points

To solve the first two issues we create a setup_cluster func, to help with
entering and exiting the context manager
```python
with ray_cluster(
    cluster_settings={...},
    use_portforwarding=True,
    delete_packaged_zips=False,
    ...
) as m:
    # do something with the cluster
```
As long as the manager deligates the setup and teardown error handling
to contextlib.ExitStack, we can be sure that all resources are cleaned up
correctly.

The third issue is solved by allowing the user to pass in a ray address
to the setup_cluster function.
