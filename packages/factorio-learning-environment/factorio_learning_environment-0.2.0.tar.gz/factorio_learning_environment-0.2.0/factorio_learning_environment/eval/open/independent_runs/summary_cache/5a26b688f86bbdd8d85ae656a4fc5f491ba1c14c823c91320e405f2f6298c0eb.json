{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 88-95)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-18.5, 69.5)\n(Now partially operational with fuel but still connection issues)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-18.5 y=69.5) - operational but disconnected\n- Boiler (position x=-4.5 y=50.0) - now fueled with coal (24 units) but water connection incomplete\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=50.5) - still not connected to power network\n- Pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes (positions: x=-18.5,y=67.5; x=-18.5,y=68.5) - partially connected\n  - Steam pipes (positions: x=0.5,y=47.5) - isolated\n- Power pole networks:\n  - Main grid (positions: x=0.5,y=53.5) - inactive\n  - Isolated pole at x=-50.5 y=18.5\n\n### Stone Mining and Smelting Operation at position (-49.5, 10.5)\n(Unchanged from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5 y=10.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0 y=11.0)\n- Input inserter (position x=-47.5 y=10.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-44.5 y=11.5)\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=12.5)\n\n### Mining Operation at position (-52.5, 16.5)\n(Still operational but isolated)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-52.5 y=16.5) - receiving stone but no power\n- Stone furnace (position x=-50.0 y=16.0) - working with coal (18 remaining)\n- Power pole (position x=-50.5 y=18.5) - still isolated\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid Connection Failures (critical)\n- Continued pipe connection issues (steps 88, 91, 92, 94)\n  - Offshore pump to boiler connection still failing\n  - Steam engine not receiving steam\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Verify complete fluid path from pump to engine\n    2. Check all pipe connections are properly aligned\n    3. Implement system-wide fluid flow validation\n\n### Placement Distance Issues (ongoing)\n- Underground pipe placement too far (step 89)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Maintain minimum distance requirements\n    2. Implement movement before placement\n\n### Collision Detection (ongoing)\n- Existing pipe blocking placement (step 90)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Clear existing pipes before rebuilding\n    2. Implement automatic obstacle removal\n\n### Resource Management (critical)\n- Coal insertion failures (step 93)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Maintain minimum fuel inventory\n    2. Implement fuel collection before system startup\n    3. Add inventory checks before insertion attempts\n\n### System Verification (critical)\n- Boiler status check failures (step 95)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement proper fluid box indexing\n    2. Add comprehensive system diagnostics\n    3. Verify all connection points before operation\n\n### Build Process Improvements (ongoing)\n- Multiple build failures:\n  - Need for position adjustments\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement phased construction:\n       - Clearance phase\n       - Placement phase\n       - Verification phase\n    2. Add position validation steps\n\n### Entity Management (ongoing)\n- Missing entity references\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Maintain complete entity tracking\n    2. Implement existence verification\n    3. Handle stale references properly\n\n### Power System Validation (ongoing)\n- Steam engine still not connected\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Verify complete power chain:\n       - Generator to pole\n       - Pole to consumers\n    2. Implement network validation checks"}
