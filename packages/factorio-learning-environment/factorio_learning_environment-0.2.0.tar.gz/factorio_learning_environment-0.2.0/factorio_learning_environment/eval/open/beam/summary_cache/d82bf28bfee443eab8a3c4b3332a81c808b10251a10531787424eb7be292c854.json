{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Manual Iron Smelting Setup at (5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- First furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\n- Second furnace at position (7.0, -73.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal as fuel but are currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Automated Iron Mining and Smelting Setup near (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore, currently working\n- Iron chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) collecting iron ore from the drill, currently contains 9 iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) placed next to the chest, currently idle with no ingredients\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with crafting items requiring assembly\n- Items like burner mining drills require iron plates which cannot be crafted directly in inventory\n- Ensure iron plates are smelted in furnaces before attempting to craft items requiring them\n\n### Errors with missing raw resources\n- Wood cannot be crafted and must be gathered from the environment\n- Ensure required raw resources are collected before attempting to craft items needing them\n\n### Errors with inventory management\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them (like coal into machines)\n- Check inventory for required building materials before attempting to place structures\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- When placing entities that need to interact (like inserters between structures), ensure there is enough space\n- Consider the tile dimensions of existing structures when placing new entities nearby\n- Pay attention to exact drop positions when creating automated setups\n- When placing entities that need to connect, verify the spacing and direction parameters are appropriate\n\n### Errors with automated setups\n- Ensure receiving entities (like furnaces) are placed exactly at the drop position of source entities (like drills)\n- When entities show \"waiting for space in destination\", ensure proper output collection is set up"}
