{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n    - Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5)\n- **Furnaces** for smelting iron ore:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: Working\n    - Inventory: Coal (5), Iron Ore (4), Iron Plate (29)\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: Working\n    - Inventory: Coal (7), Iron Plate (49)\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: No Ingredients\n    - Inventory: Coal (17), Iron Plate (25)\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (7.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (6.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (9.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (8.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (4.5, -58.5)\n    - Inventory: Iron Ore (7)\n  - Chest at position (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests that are full to prevent stoppage of mining operations. Specifically, empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to continue smelting operations. Regularly check and supply iron ore to furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0).\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Ensure the target entity has enough space before attempting to insert items. The error at line 107 indicates an attempt to insert coal into a furnace that could not accept more items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. \n  - Failure Mode: Could not insert item if the target entity is full or not compatible with the item.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: Represents the furnace entity being interacted with.\n- `coal_needed`: Represents the quantity of coal intended to be inserted into a furnace."}
