{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) containing iron plates and copper plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing coal and copper plates.\n- Transport Belt connecting these chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal and supplied with iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest to the furnace.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Transport and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions including (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=4.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Supplying Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to a valid entity containing the required items. For example, the inserter at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) could not find iron plates to extract.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the inserters are correctly positioned and have access to the necessary source items. Inserters at positions (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), (x=8.5, y=0.5), and (x=11.5, y=0.5) are waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly empty chests that are at risk of becoming full to ensure continuous operation. The chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) is full, preventing the burner mining drill from continuing mining operations."}
