{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, placed on iron ore patch\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) facing up, used to smelt iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates from the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) facing right, moving iron plates from furnace to chest and powered by coal\n\nThis structure forms a compact iron plate production line with mining, smelting, and collection integrated closely.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters adjacent to occupied tiles\n- When placing an inserter next to another entity (e.g., furnace), ensure the target tile is free. In Step 1, the inserter placement failed because a wooden chest occupied the intended tile.\n- To avoid this, increase spacing, change placement direction, or select a different reference position for placing the inserter.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients in entities\n- Furnaces and burner inserters require fuel (e.g., coal) to operate. Several logs indicate entities running out of fuel or waiting for source items.\n- Always ensure to insert sufficient fuel into drills, furnaces, and inserters promptly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors inserting items when inventory is empty\n- Attempts to insert iron ore or coal into entities failed due to empty inventory.\n- Before inserting items, verify that the inventory contains the required items.\n\n### Errors placing entities too far from player position\n- The burner inserter placement at position (16.5, 72.5) failed because the player was too far away (distance > 10).\n- Move closer to the target position before placing entities to avoid placement distance errors.\n\n### Correcting misplaced inserters\n- Removing and replacing incorrectly placed inserters is necessary to maintain proper item flow.\n- Double-check placement positions and directions before finalizing entity placement.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
