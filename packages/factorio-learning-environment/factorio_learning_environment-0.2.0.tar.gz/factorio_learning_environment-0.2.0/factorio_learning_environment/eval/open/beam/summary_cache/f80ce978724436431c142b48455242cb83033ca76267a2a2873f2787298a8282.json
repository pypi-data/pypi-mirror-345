{"content": "Based on the repeated interactions, I can provide an analysis of the Factorio API patterns:\n\nSuccessful Pattern Identified:\n```python\n# 1. Resource Location\nstone_pos = nearest(Resource.Stone)\n\n# 2. Movement\nmove_to(stone_pos)\n\n# 3. Resource Gathering\nstone_gathered = harvest_resource(stone_pos, quantity=10)\n\n# 4. Inventory Verification\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\n\n# 5. Crafting with Verification\nif inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0) >= 5:\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\n```\n\nKey Observations:\n1. The API consistently returns positions for resources (e.g., \"x=-14.5 y=-14.5\")\n2. Harvesting 10 stone results in exactly 10 stone in inventory\n3. Crafting a stone furnace consumes exactly 5 stone\n4. The inventory system is dictionary-based with item names as keys\n5. All operations (move, harvest, craft) appear to be atomic and reliable\n\nImportant Patterns:\n1. Always verify inventory before crafting\n2. Gather more resources than minimum needed (buffer)\n3. Check inventory after each operation to confirm results\n4. Use the get() method with a default value (0) for safe inventory checking\n\nInventory Management:\n- Initial inventory shows existing items\n- Inventory updates reflect exact resource changes\n- After crafting, stone reduces by 5 and stone-furnace appears\n\nThis pattern has proven 100% reliable across multiple executions, suggesting it's the optimal approach for resource gathering and crafting operations in the Factorio API.", "summary_range": "[1-2474]"}
