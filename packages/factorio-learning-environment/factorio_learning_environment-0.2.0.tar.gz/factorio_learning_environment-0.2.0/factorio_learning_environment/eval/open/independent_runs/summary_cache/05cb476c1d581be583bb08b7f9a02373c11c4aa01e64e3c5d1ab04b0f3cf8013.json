{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to extract iron ore and process it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): This drill extracts iron ore from the resource patch and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): This chest temporarily stores the extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): This inserter is responsible for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): This furnace is intended to smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to pick up items from the chest and place them into the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates potential misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items from an Empty Chest\n- Before attempting to extract items from a chest, verify that the chest contains the desired items. Attempting to extract from an empty chest will result in errors.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Refueling is necessary to prevent interruptions in resource processing.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to function. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly transferring items.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chest\n- Monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining drill's operation. Regularly extract items from the chest to maintain space for new resources."}
