{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and iron ore input, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and iron ore input, producing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, currently out of fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) and another at position (42.5, -83.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest at position (41.5, -79.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (42.5, -83.5), and (46.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (42.5, -83.5) to (45.5, -83.5) transporting coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity connected to the inserter is producing or has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the connectivity and status of the source entity.\n\n### Errors with Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner mining drills to ensure they have sufficient fuel to operate. Automate fuel supply if possible to prevent downtime.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Output Full\n- Monitor furnace output inventories to prevent them from becoming full. Consider using inserters to automatically remove items from the furnace to maintain continuous operation."}
