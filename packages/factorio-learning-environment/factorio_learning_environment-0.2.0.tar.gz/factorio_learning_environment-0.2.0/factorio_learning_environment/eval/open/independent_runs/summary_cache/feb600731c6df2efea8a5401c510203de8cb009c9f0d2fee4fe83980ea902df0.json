Check for any obstacles or blockages that might prevent successful pipe placement.\n- Verify that the target positions for pipe connections are valid and not occupied by other entities or terrain features.\n\n### Errors due to placement blockage\n- Before attempting to place or connect entities, ensure that the target area is free of any obstructions. This includes other entities, terrain features, or any other objects that might block placement.\n\n### Repeated errors in pipe reconnection\n- When reconnecting pipes between offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines, ensure that all connections are clear of obstructions and that the pipes are aligned correctly. Double-check the start and end points of each pipe segment to ensure proper alignment and connectivity."}
