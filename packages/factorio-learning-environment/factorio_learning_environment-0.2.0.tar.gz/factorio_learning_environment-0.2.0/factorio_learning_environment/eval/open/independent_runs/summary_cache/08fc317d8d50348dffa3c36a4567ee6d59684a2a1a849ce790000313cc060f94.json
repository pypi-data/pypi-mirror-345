{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, here is the updated report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting copper plates:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nSingle stone furnace for smelting iron plates:\n- Furnace at position (4.0, 4.0)\n\n### Electronic Circuit Assembly Line\nLocated around position (9.5, 11.5), consists of:\n- Input wooden chest at (6.5, 11.5) containing copper cables\n- Burner inserter at (7.5, 11.5) moving items from input chest to assembling machine\n- Assembling machine 1 at (9.5, 11.5) crafting electronic circuits\n- Burner inserter at (11.5, 11.5) moving finished products\n- Output wooden chest at (12.5, 11.5) storing iron plates, copper plates and electronic circuits\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-7.0, 24.5), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) providing water\n- Pipe network connecting water flow\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 24.5) generating steam\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Connected to electrical network with multiple poles\n\n### Science Pack Storage System\nLocated around position (0.5, 30.5), consists of:\n- Wooden chest at (0.5, 31.5) storing automation and logistic science packs\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 30.5) for moving science packs\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Cannot extract items from furnaces or chests that are empty or don't contain the requested items\n- Ensure items are actually produced before attempting extraction\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Cannot craft items without required technology research (e.g. steel chest requiring steel processing)\n- Ensure all recipe prerequisites and required technologies are unlocked before crafting\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Cannot place chests without having them in inventory first\n- Craft required items before attempting placement\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor chest capacity - output chest is getting full preventing further production\n- Empty or expand storage when chests become full to maintain production flow"}
