{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, facilitating water flow from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel but currently lacking ingredients to smelt copper ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel but currently lacking ingredients to smelt iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel but currently lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5) for storing items.\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items between the stone furnace and the wooden chest, currently not receiving electricity.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs but not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups facilitating fluid transport across various positions, including:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-1.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 23.5) with water, working status\n- PipeGroup at Position (-4.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electrical Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, currently not supplying power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the path for connecting pipes is clear of obstructions before attempting to connect them. Remove any entities blocking the path.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters without Power\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source to function properly. Check the electrical network for connectivity issues.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the tile is unoccupied before placing an entity to avoid placement blockage errors."}
