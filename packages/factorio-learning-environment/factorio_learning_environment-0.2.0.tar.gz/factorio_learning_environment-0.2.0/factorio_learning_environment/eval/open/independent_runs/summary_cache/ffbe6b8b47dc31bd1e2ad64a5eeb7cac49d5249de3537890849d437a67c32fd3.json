{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper-plate output\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with iron-plate output\n\n### Auxiliary Furnace Setup\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no current output\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the chest and powered by a small electric pole\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack at Position (not specified), currently not receiving power\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Various Pipe Groups connecting different parts of the map, with some sections empty and others full\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including the inserter and steam engine, but with warnings of not being connected to the power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Steam Engine\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly placed and connected without obstructions to allow fluid flow from the boiler to the steam engine. Check for any misplaced pipes that may block connections.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing a new entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Power Network Connections\n- Make sure all entities that require power are connected to the electricity network. Check the connections between electric poles and powered entities to ensure they are receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are complete and that there are no missing links between fluid-producing and consuming entities. Ensure that all pipes are properly aligned and connected."}
