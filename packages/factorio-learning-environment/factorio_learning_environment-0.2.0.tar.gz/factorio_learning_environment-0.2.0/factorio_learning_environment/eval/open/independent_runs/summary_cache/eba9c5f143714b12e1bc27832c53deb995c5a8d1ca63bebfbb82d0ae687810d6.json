{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (62.0, -53.0)\n- Consists of a Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0).\n- The furnace is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- The furnace has been refueled with coal but still lacks ingredients to smelt.\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Consists of:\n  - Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n  - Boiler at position (-7.0, 24.5)\n  - Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n  - PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and the Boiler to the Steam Engine\n  - Small Electric Pole at position (1.5, 24.5) connecting the Steam Engine to the power network\n- The Offshore Pump supplies water to the Boiler, which is fueled by coal to produce steam for the Steam Engine. The Steam Engine generates electricity, which is distributed via the Small Electric Pole.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that the required items are present in the inventory before attempting to place entities like the offshore pump and stone furnace.\n\n#### Errors in Crafting Due to Insufficient Resources\n- Before crafting, verify that all necessary resources are available in the inventory. For example, ensure you have enough iron plates, electronic circuits, and pipes when crafting an offshore pump.\n- Consistently check inventory levels to avoid crafting interruptions due to missing components like electronic circuits and copper plates.\n\n#### Type Errors in Code\n- When using functions that require specific data types, ensure that the correct type is being used. For instance, converting attributes to integers should be done with valid numeric types.\n\n#### Errors When Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity contains the items you wish to extract. For example, verify that the stone furnace contains iron plates or copper plates before attempting to extract them.\n- Avoid attempting to extract more items than are available in the entity.\n\n#### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Confirm that the entity you wish to place is available in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n- Ensure you are within the maximum allowable distance to place an entity. Move closer to the target position if necessary.\n- Verify that the target position for placing an entity is unoccupied to avoid placement errors.\n\n#### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items, such as pipes, in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like the offshore pump and boiler.\n- Verify that the entities you are attempting to connect are correctly aligned and within range to establish a connection.\n- When connecting pipes, ensure that the fluid system is correctly configured and that the connections are not nil.\n\n#### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in entities like boilers and ensure they are refueled to maintain operation.\n\n#### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Raw Resources\n- Gather all necessary raw resources, such as wood, before attempting to craft items that require them as sub-ingredients.\n\n#### Errors in Movement Commands\n- Ensure that the position data used in movement commands is correctly formatted and that you are using integer indices instead of strings."}
