{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The drill is operational but has a warning: \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace has a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt\" and is currently not producing due to lack of input materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a tile before attempting placement. This includes checking if the tile is occupied or if the placement is valid for that entity type.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the target location for moving an entity is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move the entity.\n\n### Errors when accessing entities at specific positions\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the entity type exists at the specified position before attempting to access or manipulate it.\n\n### Output blockage warnings\n- Ensure that there is a valid sink entity (e.g., chest, belt) to accept the output from production entities like drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### No ingredients warnings in furnaces\n- Make sure that the necessary ingredients are available and correctly fed into the furnace to maintain continuous production."}
