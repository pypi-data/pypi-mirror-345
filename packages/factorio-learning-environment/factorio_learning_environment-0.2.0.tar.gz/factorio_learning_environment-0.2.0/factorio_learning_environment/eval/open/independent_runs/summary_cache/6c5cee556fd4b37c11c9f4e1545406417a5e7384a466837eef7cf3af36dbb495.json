{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line (y=0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron plates:\n- Stone furnace 1 at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace 2 at (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Iron Smelting Line (y=4)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron plates:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n### Copper Smelting Line (y=4)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting copper plates:\n- Stone furnace 1 at (0.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace 2 at (2.0, 4.0)\n\n### Research Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab at (8.5, 0.5) currently researching automation with automation science packs\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-9.5, 23.0)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Check if required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into machines\n- Ensure you have necessary raw materials before crafting complex items\n- Verify you have the required building/entity in inventory before attempting placement\n\n### Crafting Chain Errors\n- When crafting complex items like labs, ensure you have all prerequisite items and appropriate crafting facilities\n- For items requiring machine assembly (like copper cables), use appropriate assembly machines instead of trying to hand craft\n\n### Building Placement Errors\n- Verify terrain compatibility before placing buildings (especially near water)\n- Check for obstructions or overlapping entities before placement\n- Ensure proper spacing between buildings, especially for larger structures\n\n### Type Operation Errors\n- Avoid direct arithmetic operations on prototype attributes\n- Use proper accessor methods or properties when working with entity dimensions\n\n### Power System Connection Errors\n- Steam engines need proper positioning relative to boilers\n- Ensure fluid connections are properly aligned between power system components\n- Maintain correct spacing for fluid flow between components"}
