{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently working and extracting resources from the nearby iron ore patch. It has a fuel inventory containing coal and is connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for resource drop-off.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which is currently full of iron ore, preventing further extraction from the burner mining drill.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients and is full of coal. It has a result inventory containing iron plates.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) which contains iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when the wooden chest at drop position is full**: \n  - Empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining. Ensure that there is enough space in the chest for the resources being extracted.\n  \n- **Errors when the stone furnace has no ingredients to smelt**: \n  - Ensure that you are providing the necessary ingredients to the stone furnace for it to operate. Check the inventory and supply the required materials.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace fuel source is full**: \n  - Monitor the fuel inventory of the stone furnace and remove excess fuel if it is full to allow for smelting operations.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace result is full**: \n  - Clear the output inventory of the stone furnace to allow for new results to be processed.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: None reported in the execution logs.\n- **Variables Assigned**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `position`: tuple (float, float)\n  - `inventory`: dict (str: int)"}
