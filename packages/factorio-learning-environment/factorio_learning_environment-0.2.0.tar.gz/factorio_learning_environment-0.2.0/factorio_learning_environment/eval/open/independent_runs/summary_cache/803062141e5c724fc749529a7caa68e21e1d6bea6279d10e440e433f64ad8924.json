{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Intended to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace. Currently misaligned.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position for successful item transfer. Misalignment is causing the furnace to not receive iron ore.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position to ensure proper delivery of materials.\n\n### Refueling and Resource Management\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as the burner inserter and mining drill, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n- Monitor inventory levels to ensure sufficient resources are available for refueling and operation.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Avoid attempting to insert items into entities when there are insufficient resources in the inventory, as seen with the coal insertion error. Always check inventory levels before such operations."}
