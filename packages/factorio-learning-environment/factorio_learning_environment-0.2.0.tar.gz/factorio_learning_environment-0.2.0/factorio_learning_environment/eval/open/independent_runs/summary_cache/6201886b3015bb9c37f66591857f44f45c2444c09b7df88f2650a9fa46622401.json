Check for existing entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing small-electric-poles is free of existing objects. If the position is blocked, choose a different location for placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place entities. The maximum placement distance is limited, so ensure you are within range."}
