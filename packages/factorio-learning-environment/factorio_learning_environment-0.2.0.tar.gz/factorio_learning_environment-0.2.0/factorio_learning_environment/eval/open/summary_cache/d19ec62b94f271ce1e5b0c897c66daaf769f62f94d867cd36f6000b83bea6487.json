{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal (fuel inventory 49) but output blocked due to no sink entity accepting output  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, currently out of fuel and not operational  \n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from mining drill to furnace, currently out of fuel and waiting for source items  \n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from assembling machine, currently out of fuel and waiting for source items  \n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into assembling machine, currently out of fuel and waiting for space in destination  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, currently not receiving electricity and has zero energy  \n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections, connected to other poles but assembler still not powered  \n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, the furnace and inserters lack fuel, and the assembling machine is not receiving power, causing production to halt. The burner mining drill output is blocked due to no downstream entity accepting its output.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power despite pole connections  \n- Ensure electric poles are properly connected in a continuous power network covering the assembler and all inserters.  \n- Verify that poles have power and that the assembler's connection points are within pole coverage.  \n- Check for any misplaced poles or gaps in the power network that prevent power delivery.  \n- Confirm the assembler itself is not damaged or malfunctioning.  \n\n### Errors due to burner inserters and furnace running out of fuel  \n- Always maintain sufficient coal in inventory to insert into burner inserters and furnaces to keep them operational.  \n- Insert coal into burner inserters feeding the furnace and assembler to avoid stoppages.  \n- Monitor fuel levels and automate fuel insertion if possible to prevent manual shortages.  \n\n### Errors inserting coal when inventory is empty  \n- Before attempting to insert coal into entities, verify that coal is present in the player inventory.  \n- Harvest or acquire coal proactively to avoid running out during insertion attempts.  \n- Implement inventory checks before insertion calls to prevent exceptions.  \n\n### Errors caused by blocked output from burner mining drill  \n- Ensure there is a valid sink entity (e.g., inserter, belt, or chest) at the mining drill\u2019s output position to accept mined items.  \n- Avoid placing entities that block the output tile or fail to remove items, causing the drill to stop working.  \n\n### Errors related to entity placement collisions and occupied tiles (from previous report)  \n- Continue to verify target tiles are free before placing inserters, poles, or assembling machines.  \n- Adjust placement positions or directions to avoid collisions with existing entities.  \n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
