{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position(x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining and smelting iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0): This drill extracts iron ore and is currently fueled with coal. It has a warning indicating that its output is blocked by an item on the ground, and there is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0): This furnace is used to smelt the iron ore into iron plates. It is currently fueled with coal but has a warning indicating that there are no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is not already occupied by another entity or object. Check the map for available space before attempting to place these entities.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the target location for moving entities such as Stone Furnaces is valid and unoccupied. Attempting to move an entity to an invalid location will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from the map\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to retrieve, such as a Stone Furnace, exists at the specified position. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity is present before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Output blockage warnings\n- Address the warning from the Burner Mining Drill by ensuring there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output. This will prevent the drill from being blocked and unable to continue mining.\n\n### No ingredients to smelt warnings\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients, such as iron ore, to smelt. Without these ingredients, the furnace will not be able to produce iron plates."}
