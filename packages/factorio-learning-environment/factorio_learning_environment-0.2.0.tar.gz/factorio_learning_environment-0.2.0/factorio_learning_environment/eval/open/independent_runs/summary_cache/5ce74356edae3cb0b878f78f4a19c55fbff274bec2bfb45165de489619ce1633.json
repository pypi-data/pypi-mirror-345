Check the target location for obstacles.\n- Avoid placing pipe-to-ground where the entity footprint overlaps with water. Choose a different location to avoid overlap.\n- Ensure you have the necessary pipes in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Verify that the underground pipes are correctly aligned and within connection range before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Ingredient Shortages\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to function. Check the inventory and supply the required materials.\n\n### Electricity Network Issues\n- Connect the electricity group to the electric network to ensure it is plugged in and functional."}
