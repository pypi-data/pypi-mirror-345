{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5) with status WORKING\n- Pipe Groups connecting these entities, with some pipes at positions (x=19.5, y=-2.5) and (x=18.5, y=-6.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Iron Plate Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Additional Structures\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5) with status WORKING\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) with status NO_POWER\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5) with status NORMAL\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, providing no voltage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Pipes\n- Ensure that the target position for placing a pipe is unoccupied before attempting to place it. Remove any existing entities at the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Pipes\n- Verify the existence of a pipe at the specified position before attempting to pick it up to avoid errors related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all necessary connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine are established to allow the flow of water and generation of electricity. The boiler must receive water to function correctly.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Supply\n- Check that all electrical entities are properly connected to a power source to avoid issues with entities not receiving electricity."}
