{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- **Burner inserter** at (17.5, 72.5) moving ore to belts\n- **Transport belts** connecting drill to inserter and furnace\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 74.0) for smelting iron ore (currently out of fuel)\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) extracting copper ore\n- **Burner inserter** at (-48.5, 72.5) moving ore to belts\n- **Transport belts** connecting drill to inserter and furnace\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 74.0) for smelting copper ore (currently out of fuel)\n\n#### Power Generation Setup at (-21.5, 70.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-21.5, 70.5) supplying water\n- **Boiler** at (-25.0, 80.5) converting water to steam (currently out of fuel)\n- **Steam engine** at (-25.5, 89.5) for power generation (not connected to network)\n- **Pipe network** connecting these components\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Placement and Connection Errors\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- When placing entities next to others:\n  - Check for existing entities that might block placement\n  - Adjust spacing or direction if placement fails\n  - Avoid placing on occupied tiles or water\n\n#### Distance-Related Errors\n- Move closer to target positions before placing entities (max placement distance is 10 tiles)\n- When working with distant setups (like copper mining at -46.5), ensure you're within range\n\n#### Fuel and Power Issues\n- Add coal to boilers and furnaces to keep them operational\n- Connect steam engines to power network to distribute electricity\n- Ensure miners are connected to power poles\n\n#### Belt Blockages\n- Clear backed-up transport belts to allow inserter operation\n- Monitor belt inventories to prevent congestion\n\n#### General Placement Tips\n- Always verify target position is clear before placing\n- Consider entity dimensions when placing near others\n- Use larger spacing when placing complex setups"}
