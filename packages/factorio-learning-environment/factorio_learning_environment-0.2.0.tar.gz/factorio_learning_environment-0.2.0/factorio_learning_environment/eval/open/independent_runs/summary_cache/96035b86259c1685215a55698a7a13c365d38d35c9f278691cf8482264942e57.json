Always add an inserter to serve as the belt\u2019s target to ensure proper item transfer.\n\u2013 Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is within the permissible placement distance. If the target is too far (e.g. a distance of 15.89 when the max allowed is 10), move closer to the intended position.\n\u2013 Confirm that the required items are available in inventory prior to placement to avoid \u201cNo \u2026 in inventory\u201d errors.\n\u2013 Check that all variables are correctly defined before use to prevent NameError issues (for example, ensure \u2018target_chest\u2019 is properly initialized)."}
