Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments to prevent TypeErrors.\n\n\u2022 Data Iteration Safety: Before iterating over the results from get_entities, verify that the returned value is a valid list rather than None to prevent \u201cNoneType\u201d iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Verification: Ensure that required items (for example, a Lab) are present in the inventory before attempting placement on the map. This avoids errors related to missing inventory during placement.\n\n\u2022 Sub-Component Resource Chain: Validate that all dependencies for lab production\u2014such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables\u2014can be produced with available raw materials and processing structures. Addressing shortages in these sub-ingredients helps prevent cascading crafting failures."}
