{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore. Currently fueled with coal and operational.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Used for storing extracted iron ore.\n  - Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Used for storing processed iron plates and additional iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates. Fueled with coal and operational.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers items between the chests and the furnace. Fueled with coal and operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or empty entities\n- Ensure the target entity exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract. For example, verify that the wooden chest contains iron plates before extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory or storage\n- Regularly check and manage inventory and storage capacities to prevent overflow. Ensure chests and other storage entities have enough space to accommodate new items."}
