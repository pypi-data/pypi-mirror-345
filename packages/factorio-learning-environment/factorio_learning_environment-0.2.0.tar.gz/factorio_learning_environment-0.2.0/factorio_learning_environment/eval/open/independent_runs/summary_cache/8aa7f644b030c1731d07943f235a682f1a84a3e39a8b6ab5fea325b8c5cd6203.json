{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-4.5, y=3.0)\n- Steam engine (position x=1.5, y=7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting water from pump to boiler and steam to engine\n\nCurrent status: The system is partially working (producing water and steam) but the boiler has no fuel and the steam engine is not connected to a power network.\n\n### Coal Mining System at (16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=16.5, y=1.5)\n- Wooden chest (position x=16.5, y=2.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=16.5, y=3.5)\n- Transport belt (position x=16.5, y=4.5)\n\nCurrent status: The drill is out of fuel and output is blocked. The system is set up to mine coal and store it in a chest.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System at (15.5, 68.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position x=15.5, y=68.5)\n- Electric mining drill (position x=15.5, y=70.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=15.5, y=72.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=16.0, y=74.0)\n- Coal inserter for furnace (position x=14.5, y=74.5)\n- Output inserter (position x=16.5, y=75.5)\n- Transport belt (position x=16.5, y=76.5)\n\nCurrent status: The mining drill is not receiving electricity. The furnace has fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting System at (-46.5, 71.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position x=-46.5, y=71.5)\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-46.5, y=73.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-46.5, y=75.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0, y=77.0)\n- Coal inserter for furnace (position x=-47.5, y=77.5)\n- Output inserter (position x=-45.5, y=78.5)\n\nCurrent status: The mining drill is not receiving electricity. The furnace has fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Assembly System at (24.5, 82.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=24.5, y=82.5)\n- Input burner inserter (position x=22.5, y=82.5)\n\nCurrent status: The assembling machine is not receiving electricity and is missing required iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly from a chest to another entity - you need to add an inserter that takes items from the chest and use the inserter as a source entity\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to a boiler - you need to add an inserter that inputs items into the boiler and use the inserter as the target entity\n- When connecting distant entities with belts, ensure there is a valid path between them - the error \"Not a valid path to normalise\" indicates the distance may be too great or there are obstacles\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target location is already occupied by another entity or object\n- When placing an inserter next to an entity, ensure there is enough space between entities - consider increasing spacing or changing direction\n- Be aware of entity collision boxes - some entities like mining drills have large footprints that may block placement of other entities nearby\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- The steam engine and electric mining drills are not receiving electricity - ensure they are properly connected to a power network\n- Make sure to connect power poles to create a complete electrical network between all electrical devices\n\n### Resource and fuel management\n- Mining drills and boilers need fuel to operate - ensure they have a steady supply of"}
