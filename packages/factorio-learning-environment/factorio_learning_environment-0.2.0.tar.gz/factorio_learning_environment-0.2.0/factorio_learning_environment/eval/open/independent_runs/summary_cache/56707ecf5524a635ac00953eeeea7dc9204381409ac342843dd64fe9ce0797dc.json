For example, verify that an input chest is not occupying the inserter\u2019s pickup position before connecting.\n  - When transferring items to assembling machines, always use a correctly positioned inserter instead of attempting direct belt connections.\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt Path and Placement:\n  - Confirm that each belt segment has a valid and normalized path, including appropriate intermediate waypoints, to avoid errors such as \u201cNot a valid path to normalise.\u201d\n  - Always move within the permissible placement range before attempting to place a transport belt; adjust the player\u2019s position to remain within the maximum allowed distance.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Crafting Dependencies:\n  - Check that the required inventory items are available before placement. For instance, ensure transport belts are in stock to prevent errors like \u201cNo transport_belt in inventory.\u201d\n  - Verify that all necessary ingredients and processes (such as smelting iron plates) are functioning prior to initiating crafting operations to avoid sub-ingredient related crafting failures.\n\n\u2022 Variable Definition and API Usage:\n  - Ensure that all required variables (e.g., the variable used for the final belt segment such as \u201cfinal_belt\u201d) are properly defined prior to use to avoid NameErrors.\n  - Use accurate entity attribute names and connection targets to prevent API or attribute usage errors.\n\n\u2022 Maintain Coordination Between Systems:\n  - Continue synchronizing transfers between smelting outputs and factory inputs to minimize disruptions in the supply chain, ensuring that resource flow is uninterrupted."}
