{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), steam engine (position not specified), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5).\n\n### Electric pole placements\nConsists of the following electric poles:\n- Small electric pole (position -22.5, 18.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -22.5, 20.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -20.5, 18.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -20.5, 20.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -20.5, 28.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -18.5, 18.5)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) that is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) that is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the location is not overlapping with water or other entities before placing an electric pole.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities to power\n- Verify that the electric poles are within range of the entities (lab and assembling machine) that need power. If they are not receiving power, check the connections and the distance to the nearest electric pole.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
