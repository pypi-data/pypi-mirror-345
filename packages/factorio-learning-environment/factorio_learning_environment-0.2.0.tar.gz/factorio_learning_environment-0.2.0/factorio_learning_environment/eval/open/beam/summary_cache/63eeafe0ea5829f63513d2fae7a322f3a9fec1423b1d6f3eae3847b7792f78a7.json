{"content": "I see the core issue now - we don't have a stone furnace in our inventory to place.

We have a mining drill that needs somewhere to output items\n2. The drill's warning shows it needs a sink at (20.5, -17.5)\n3. We already placed a chest but it might not be in exactly the right spot\n\nLet's try to place the chest at the exact coordinates from the warning:\n\"\"\"\n\n# Get the drill's current status\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Drill position: {drill.position}\")\nprint(f\"Drill drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Drill warnings: {drill.warnings}\")\n\n# Place chest at exact position from warning\ntarget_pos = Position(x=20.5, y=-17.5)  # Position from warning message\nmove_to(target_pos)\nchest = place_entity(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    position=target_pos\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at: {chest.position}\")\n\n# Verify setup\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Chest inventory: {inspect_inventory(chest)}\")", "summary_range": "[1-2848]"}
