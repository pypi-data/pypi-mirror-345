{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) - Extracts iron ore (output blocked)\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 74.0) - Smelted iron ore into plates (removed in step 29)\n- **Burner inserter** at (16.5, 75.5) - Transfers plates from furnace to chest\n- **Wooden chest** at (17.5, 75.5) - Stores smelted iron plates\n- **Wooden chest** at (15.5, 75.5) - New ore storage\n\n### Copper Mining Setup\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) - Extracts copper ore (removed in step 29)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-46.5, 74.5) - New copper ore storage\n- Connected to power network via small electric pole at (-44.5, 68.5)\n\n### Power Generation Setup\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Pumps water\n- **Boiler** at (-6.0, -0.5) - Heats water into steam using coal\n- **Steam engine** at (-0.5, -0.5) - Generates electricity from steam\n- Connected pipe network between pump, boiler and engine\n- Power network connected to both mining drills\n\n### New Power Generation Attempt\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5, 69.5) - Placed but later removed\n- **Boiler** at (-8.5, 70.0) - Placed but later removed\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Water Placement Issues\n- Multiple attempts to place mining drills, assemblers and other entities on water tiles (145.0,150.0), (95.0,100.0), (1.5,4.5)\n- Always verify terrain type before placement by checking nearby water sources\n- Use the map view to identify clear land areas before building\n\n### Entity Removal and Reference Errors\n- Attempted to reference removed furnace at (16.0,74.0) after deletion\n- Always check if entities still exist before trying to reference them\n- Consider storing entity references in variables only while they exist\n\n### Power System Expansion Issues\n- Failed to place steam engine at (-5.5,70.0) due to water obstruction\n- When expanding power systems, ensure all components can be placed before removing old ones\n- Maintain backup power sources during transitions\n\n### Building Location Selection\n- Repeated attempts to build at water-logged coordinates (100.0,100.0), (150.0,150.0)\n- Develop a systematic approach to find suitable building locations:\n  1. Scan nearby area for water\n  2. Check for existing entities\n  3. Verify power network reach\n\n### Entity Placement Collisions\n- Assembling machine placement failed at (1.5,-0.5) due to existing objects\n- Always leave adequate space between entities\n- Plan factory layouts before implementation\n\n### Previous Error Persistence\n- All previously noted errors (output blockage, furnace operation) still unresolved\n- Prioritize fixing existing issues before expanding operations"}
