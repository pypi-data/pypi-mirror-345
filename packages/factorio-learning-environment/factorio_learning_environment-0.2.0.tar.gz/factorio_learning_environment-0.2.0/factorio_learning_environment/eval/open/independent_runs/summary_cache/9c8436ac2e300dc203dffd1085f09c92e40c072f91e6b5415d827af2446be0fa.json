Allow sufficient stabilization time between attempts before reinitiating connectivity operations.  \n\n\u2022 API and Manual Scan Discrepancy  \n\u2003\u2013 API calls using PipeGroup filters intermittently return 0 candidates, and manual scans have repeatedly failed to locate a matching PipeGroup near (x=-30.5, y=29.5). Adjust search tolerances and delay intervals to capture transient entity registrations.  \n\n\u2022 Connection Placement Verification  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the intended connection path between the Remote Boiler\u2019s steam output and the target PipeGroup is unobstructed and that spatial coordinates are accurately calculated to avoid placement conflicts.  \n\n\u2022 Extended Network Stabilization  \n\u2003\u2013 Incorporate longer waiting periods for network stabilization and entity update propagation prior to executing forced connection attempts, thereby reducing false negatives in candidate retrieval.\n\n"}
