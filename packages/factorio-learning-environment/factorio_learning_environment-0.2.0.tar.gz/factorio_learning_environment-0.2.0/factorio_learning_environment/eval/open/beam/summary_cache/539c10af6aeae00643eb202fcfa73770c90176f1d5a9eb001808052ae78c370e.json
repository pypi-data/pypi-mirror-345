{"content": "The nearest stone position is confirmed to be at coordinates (-14.5, -14.5). However, since the player is still at (0, 0), I need to move closer to this location to successfully place the stone furnace.\n\n### Steps to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Movement Before Placement**: Always ensure that the player is within the maximum placement distance before attempting to place any entity. In this case, the maximum distance is 10, and I need to be closer than that to the target position.\n\n2. **Check Current Position**: Before placing an entity, check the current player position and the target position to confirm that the distance is within acceptable limits.\n\n3. **Incremental Movement**: If the target position is far away, consider moving incrementally closer to the target rather than attempting to jump directly to it.\n\n4. **Use of Helper Functions**: Implement a helper function to handle movement and placement together, ensuring that movement is always executed before placement.\n\n### Next Steps:\nI will now move closer to the stone patch at (-14.5, -14.5) within the allowed distance, and then attempt to place the stone furnace again. \n\nLet's proceed with the movement. \n\n```python\n# Move to a position closer to the stone resource, within the maximum distance of 10.\nmove_to(Position(-14, -14))  # This should bring me within range to place the furnace.\n```", "summary_range": "[1-164]"}
