{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. The logs indicate that all attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you wish to place. The logs indicate repeated failures to place various entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and inserters at specified coordinates.\n\n### Errors with move operations\n- When using move operations, ensure that the target position is correctly specified and that the data types are appropriate. Errors like \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" suggest incorrect handling of position data.\n\n### Errors with API usage\n- When using functions like `nearest_buildable`, ensure that the parameters are correctly defined and that the function is applicable to the current map state. The error \"No viable place to put Prototype.WoodenChest\" suggests a need to adjust the BuildingBox size or use multiple smaller BuildingBoxes.\n\n### Errors with Position object\n- When handling Position objects, ensure they are used correctly as objects rather than callable functions. Errors such as \"'Position' object is not callable\" indicate misuse of the Position object.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its ability to successfully place entities and navigate the map."}
