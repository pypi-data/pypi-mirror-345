{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a fuel source of coal and an iron-ore supply.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with a fuel source of coal and an iron-ore supply.\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) connected to the furnace at (-20.0, -70.0).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) with a fuel source of coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for storing mined copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a fuel source of coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) for transferring items from the transport belt to the chest.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring items from the furnace to the chest.\n- Transport belts connecting the furnace to the chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Various belt groups connecting different parts of the facilities for efficient transportation of resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent production halts. For example, the chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) is full and needs to be emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items to prevent them from idling. For example, the burner inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) is waiting for source items."}
