{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe search for an iron ore patch at the distant position (150, -80) has also failed, further confirming the absence of accessible iron ore resources in the explored areas.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 5 pieces of coal (available for future use)\n- 2 pieces of iron plates (available)\n- 12 pieces of copper cables\n- 13 pieces of iron gear wheels\n- 2 pieces of Electronic Circuits (crafted)\n- 11 pieces of copper plates (produced)\n- 1 Firearm Magazine (crafted)\n\n### Summary of the Situation:\n- The ongoing inability to find iron ore patches suggests a critical shortage of this essential resource, severely limiting production capabilities.\n- The repeated failures indicate that I may need to consider alternative strategies for resource acquisition or production.\n\n### Immediate Next Steps:\n1. **Reassess Exploration Strategy**: I may need to explore completely different regions of the map that have not been touched yet. A systematic approach, such as moving in a grid pattern or spiraling outwards from the origin, could be beneficial.\n2. **Maximize Copper Utilization**: Given the abundance of copper resources, I should focus on crafting items that can be produced with copper and other available materials, such as additional electronic circuits or components that could aid in automation.\n3. **Consider Automation and Upgrades**: If I can gather enough resources to unlock automation technologies, I should prioritize those to improve efficiency in future resource collection.\n\nLet's try a new unexplored area, perhaps (300, 300), to see if any iron ore resources can be found there.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to a new position, such as (300, 300), to search for iron ore patches\nnew_exploration_position = Position(x=300, y=300)\nmove_to(new_exploration_position)\n\n# Attempt to find an iron ore resource patch at this new exploration position\niron_ore_patch_new_exploration = get_resource_patch(Resource.IronOre, position=new_exploration_position)\n\n# Check if a new iron ore patch is successfully located\nif iron_ore_patch_new_exploration:\n    print(f\"Found an iron ore patch at the new exploration position: {iron_ore_patch_new_exploration}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No iron ore patches found at this new exploration position.
