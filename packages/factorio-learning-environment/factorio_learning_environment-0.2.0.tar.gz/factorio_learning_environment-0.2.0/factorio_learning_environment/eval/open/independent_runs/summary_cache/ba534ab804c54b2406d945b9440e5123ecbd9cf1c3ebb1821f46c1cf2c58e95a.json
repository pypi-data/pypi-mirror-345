{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully built during these steps. Multiple attempts were made to locate, craft, and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) to supply Automation Science Packs, but all resulted in failures due to inventory shortages and missing sub-ingredients. Although two furnace entities were identified and used for smelting operations\u2014a furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron smelting and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper smelting\u2014these were pre\u2010existing in the environment rather than constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Function Usage Errors  \n  - Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional arguments to the get_entities function. Verify the function\u2019s signature before calling it.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Retrieval Issues  \n  - Before attempting to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), check that the Lab item is available in the inventory.  \n  - Validate that any retrieval functions return an iterable result; failing to do so can lead to errors when processing a NoneType.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Failures  \n  - Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are sufficiently available before initiating Lab crafting.  \n  - When resource shortages occur, confirm that upstream production (e.g., smelting additional iron plates or copper plates) is completed successfully and meets the recipe requirements before reattempting Lab production."}
