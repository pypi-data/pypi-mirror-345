"""
This module provides a command-line interface (CLI) for listing issues from a Jira project using the JiraClient.

The `cli_list_issues` function retrieves and formats issues based on various filters such as project, component,
reporter, and assignee. It allows users to dynamically select columns and sort the output for better readability.

Key functionalities:
- Fetch issues from Jira according to specified criteria.
- Flatten issue fields for easier processing.
- Generate headers based on user-defined or default view columns.
- Filter and sort issues based on user input.
- Handle errors related to issue listing gracefully.

Dependencies:
- `core.columns`: Utility functions for manipulating issue data.
- `core.env_fetcher`: Fetches environment-specific configurations.
- `exceptions.exceptions`: Custom exception handling for listing errors.
- `rest.client`: Contains the JiraClient for Jira API interactions.
