{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 24-31)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at (16.0, 71.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at (-46.0, 71.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n### New Iron Ore Mining Facility at (30.0, 70.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at (36.0, 74.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n### Partial Iron Processing Setup at (37.0, 73.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n### New Iron Processing Line at (36.0, 91.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (36.0, 91.0) facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (36.5, 92.5) for ore storage\n- Stone furnace at (39.0, 93.0)\n- Burner inserter at (37.5, 93.5) transferring ore to furnace\n- Output burner inserter at (40.5, 93.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (41.5, 93.5)\n\n### Direct Smelting Setup at (38.0, 72.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (38.0, 72.0) facing DOWN\n- Stone furnace at (39.0, 74.0) receiving ore directly\n- Output wooden chest at (40.5, 74.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement collision errors (recurring)\n- Verify target positions are clear before placing entities (occurred at (39.5,93.5), (38.5,75.5), (38.5,90.5))\n- Check for existing entities at target positions before placing new ones\n- Increase spacing between entities to avoid placement conflicts\n\n### Building box size issues (new)\n- Reduce BuildingBox size when searching for placement locations near (70.0,70.0) and (100.0,100.0)\n- Consider using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes instead of one large one\n\n### Direct connection problems (new)\n- Avoid connecting mining drills directly to furnaces without inserters (causes \"output blocked\" warnings)\n- Always use inserters between mining drills and furnaces for reliable operation\n- Verify inserter directions match the required item flow direction\n\n### Operational issues (expanded)\n- Address \"output blocked\" warnings by providing valid output destinations\n- Resolve \"no ingredients\" warnings by ensuring proper material supply chains\n- Monitor furnace fuel levels to prevent interruptions in smelting\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\nNo functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
