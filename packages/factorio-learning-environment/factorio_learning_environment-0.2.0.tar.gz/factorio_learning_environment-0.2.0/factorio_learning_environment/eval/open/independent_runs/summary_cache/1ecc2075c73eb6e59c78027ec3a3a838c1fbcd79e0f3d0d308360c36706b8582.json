Calls with an unexpected keyword (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or excessive positional arguments lead to TypeErrors.\n\u2003\u2022 Guard against None returns by using a fallback (e.g. an empty list) to prevent iteration errors.\n\n\u2013 Lab Placement and Crafting:\n\u2003\u2022 Verify that the lab blueprint exists in the inventory before attempting placement; failures occurred when no lab was available.\n\u2003\u2022 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients for lab crafting (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available. Ensure that upstream production (smelting and crafting of necessary plates and components) is in place to meet these requirements.\n\n\u2013 Resource Management:\n\u2003\u2022 Monitor critical resource levels prior to initiating crafting or smelting operations to avoid shortages that trigger repeated crafting errors."}
