{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures successfully placed on the map. All attempts to place structures such as furnaces, chests, inserters, and transport belts have failed due to various errors, as reflected in the logs. The agent has attempted to place entities but has not succeeded in establishing any functional structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is clear and not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity. The agent repeatedly attempted to place chests, furnaces, inserters, and transport belts on tiles that were either occupied or not buildable.\n\n### Errors related to inserting items into non-existent or misplaced entities\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, confirm that the entity is correctly placed and exists in the intended location. The agent attempted to insert coal into furnaces that were not successfully placed.\n\n### Errors due to lack of nearby entities for item insertion\n- Make sure there is a nearby entity capable of accepting the items you intend to insert. The agent encountered errors when trying to insert coal into nonexistent furnaces due to the absence of nearby entities.\n\n### Errors when identifying buildable areas\n- Verify the buildability of an area before attempting to place entities. The agent identified potential buildable areas but then attempted to place entities in non-buildable positions within those areas.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in placing and utilizing structures within the game environment."}
