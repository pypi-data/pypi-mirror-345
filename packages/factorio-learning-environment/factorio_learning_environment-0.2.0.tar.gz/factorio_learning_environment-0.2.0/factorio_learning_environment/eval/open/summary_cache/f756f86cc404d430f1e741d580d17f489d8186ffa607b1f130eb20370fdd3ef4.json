{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, with burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) feeding the chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational.\n- Output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation persists.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, though output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5) and (17.5, 72.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power when fueled, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power network via small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5), but still lacking sufficient iron plates input.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) placed and fueled with coal, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine reports shortage of iron plates preventing crafting, with input and output inventories empty.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and output inserter setup but requires sufficient iron plate input to operate.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failure to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) due to collisions with nearby mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) and terrain restrictions.\n- To avoid these errors, verify tile occupancy before placement, consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or selecting alternative reference positions.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters occasionally wait for source items due to empty input chests or output chests.\n- Maintain steady supply of input materials and clear output chests to prevent inserter stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) remains unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates despite some iron plates being inserted into input chest.\n- Input and output inventories of assembling machine remain empty or inconsistent, indicating issues with material transfer.\n- Ensure reliable insertion of iron plates into assembling machine input inventory and verify inserter functionality between chests and assembler.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, causing temporary loss of steam power generation.\n- Power network improved with additional poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5,"}
