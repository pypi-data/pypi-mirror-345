{"content": "The error you're encountering is due to the `Entity` type not being defined in the current context. This can happen if the type is not imported or defined in the environment where the code is running. Let's adjust the code to avoid this issue:\n\n1. **Remove Type Annotations for Undefined Types**: If `Entity` is not defined, we can remove the type annotations or replace them with a more generic type like `Any` if available.\n\n2. **Ensure All Necessary Imports**: Make sure all necessary imports are included at the top of your script.\n\nHere's the updated code with adjustments:\n\n```python\n# Ensure necessary imports are included\nfrom typing import Any\n\ndef confirm_and_initialize_furnace(furnace_position: Position) -> Any:\n    \"\"\"\n    Ensures the furnace exists and is accessible, handling initialization if needed.
