For example, verify the presence of a Wooden Chest at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5) before trying to connect to it.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all electrical entities like inserters and assembling machines are connected to a power source. Check the connections and ensure there is a continuous power supply.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Verify that all necessary resources are available for production in the assembling machines and furnaces. For instance, ensure copper plates are available for copper cable production.\n\n### Errors Due to Misplaced Entities\n- Double-check the placement of entities to ensure they are correctly positioned and not overlapping with other entities."}
