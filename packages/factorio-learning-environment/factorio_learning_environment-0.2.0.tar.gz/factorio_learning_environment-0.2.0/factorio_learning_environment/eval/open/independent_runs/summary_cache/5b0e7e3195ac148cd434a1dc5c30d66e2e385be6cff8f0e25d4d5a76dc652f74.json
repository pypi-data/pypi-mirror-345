{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently fueled with coal and actively working, but has a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) with varying inventory statuses. The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). The furnace at (-15.0, -48.0) is actively working with iron ore being processed into iron plates. The other two furnaces have warnings due to lack of ingredients and full fuel sources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Operations\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel burner mining drills and furnaces. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Full Output Chests\n- Regularly empty the chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full output chests. Consider setting up logistics to automate the transfer of resources from these chests.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to process. Monitor the input inventory of furnaces and supply them with necessary ingredients to avoid idle time.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int - Represents the amount of coal in the inventory, currently at 15 units.\n- `iron-plate`: int - Represents the quantity of iron plates in the inventory, currently at 6384 units.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int - Represents the quantity of iron gear wheels in the inventory, currently at 4 units.\n- `wooden-chest`: int - Represents the number of wooden chests in the inventory, currently at 3 units."}
