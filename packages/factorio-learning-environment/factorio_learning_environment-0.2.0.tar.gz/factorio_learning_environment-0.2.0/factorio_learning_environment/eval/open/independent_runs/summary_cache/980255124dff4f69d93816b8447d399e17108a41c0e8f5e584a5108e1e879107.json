However, multiple errors related to missing inventory and required sub-ingredients prevented its successful creation, and it remains unavailable on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Structure\n  - Use the get_entities function with the correct parameter format. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., remove use of 'radius') and ensure that only the expected number of positional arguments is provided.\n\n\u2022 Iterating over Returned Values\n  - Before iterating over results (such as lists of entities), verify that the returned value is not None to prevent TypeErrors from attempting to iterate over a NoneType.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement\n  - Confirm that the lab item exists in inventory before attempting placement.\n  - Ensure all prerequisite sub-ingredients (for example, iron\u2011gear\u2011wheel, electronic\u2011circuit, copper\u2011cable, and copper\u2011plate) are available or producible. Address any shortages by first processing essential resource conversions.\n\n\u2022 Resource Management\n  - Prioritize setting up and verifying production facilities (such as smelters) to secure the necessary components for subsequent lab crafting and related operations."}
