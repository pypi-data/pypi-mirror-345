{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of transport belts and a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for coal storage.\n- Transport belts form a network to facilitate coal movement from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to a stone furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0).\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) facilitating the movement of items between belts and furnaces.\n- Wooden chests at positions (-16.5, -64.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) for storing iron plates and iron ore, respectively.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) managing the transfer of iron ore to the storage chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Processing at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5) for storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) facilitating the movement of items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Placement\n- Ensure continuous placement of transport belts without gaps to avoid connection failures. Check for gaps at positions like (-12.5, -55.5) before attempting to connect belts.\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Verify the alignment and source of items for inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Check inserters at positions (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) for proper alignment.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- When accessing attributes of objects, ensure that the attribute exists. For example, the 'BeltGroup' object does not have a 'direction' attribute. Verify object properties before accessing them."}
