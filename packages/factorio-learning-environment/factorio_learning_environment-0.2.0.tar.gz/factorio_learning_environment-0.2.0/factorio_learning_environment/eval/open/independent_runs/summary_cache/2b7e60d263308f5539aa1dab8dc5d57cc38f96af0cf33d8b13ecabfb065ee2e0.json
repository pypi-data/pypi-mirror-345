{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -23.0, -68.0) with a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-24.5, -67.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -14.0, -53.0) with a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position -13.5, -54.5) that moves items from the chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) to the chest at position (-12.5, -54.5)\n- Wooden chests at positions (-12.5, -54.5) and (-13.5, -54.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Furnace at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (5.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 5.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using pickup_entity with incorrect object type\n- Ensure you are calling the correct method on the appropriate object type. The error \"TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable\" suggests that a method was attempted on an object that does not support it. Double-check the object and method compatibility.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping. For example, the chest at position (52.5, -84.5) is full, causing the mining drill to halt.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and others are currently without ingredients, which halts production.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in mining drills\n- Refill mining drills with fuel to maintain continuous operation. The drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) is out of fuel, preventing it from mining resources."}
