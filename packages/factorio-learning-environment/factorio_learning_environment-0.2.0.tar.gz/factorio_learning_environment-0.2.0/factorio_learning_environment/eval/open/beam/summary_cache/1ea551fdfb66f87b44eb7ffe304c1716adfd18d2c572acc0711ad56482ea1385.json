{"content": "I see the issue now. The error is telling us that we're too far from the target position. We need to move closer before attempting to place entities.

Moves in smaller steps to reach the target location\n2. Makes sure we're within range before trying to place entities\n3. Includes error handling to catch any placement issues\n4. Still maintains our goal of setting up an automated smelting system\n\nThe key changes are:\n- Breaking down the movement into smaller steps\n- Making sure we're within the 10-unit placement range\n- Adding error handling to catch and report any issues\n- Checking our position before attempting to place entities\n\nThis should help us avoid the \"too far away\" error and successfully place our entities.", "summary_range": "[1-2282]"}
