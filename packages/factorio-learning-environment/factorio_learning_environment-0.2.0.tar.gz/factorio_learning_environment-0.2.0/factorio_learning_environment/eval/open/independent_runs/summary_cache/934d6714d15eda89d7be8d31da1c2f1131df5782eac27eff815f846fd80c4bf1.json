{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these components, starting at Position (20.5, -10.5) and ending at Position (20.5, -5.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel supply of coal\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) with a fuel supply of coal\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) with a fuel supply of coal\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (7.5, 5.5) feeding copper plates\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for storing mined iron ore\n\n### Transport Belt System at Position (10.5, 5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Belt Group at Position (10.5, 5.5) with inputs and outputs\n- Inserter at Position (9.5, 5.5) interacting with the belt system\n- Wooden Chest at Position (8.5, 5.5) storing copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the transport belts are aligned correctly and have a valid path for connection. Verify that the start and end positions are not blocked or misaligned.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to the required source items. Check that the source entity is correctly positioned and has the necessary items available.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Clear any blockages on the transport belt to ensure the inserter can drop items. Regularly check and maintain the belt to prevent congestion.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and ensure they are refueled promptly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Assembling Machine Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has a constant supply of required ingredients. Verify that the input sources are functioning correctly and are not depleted."}
