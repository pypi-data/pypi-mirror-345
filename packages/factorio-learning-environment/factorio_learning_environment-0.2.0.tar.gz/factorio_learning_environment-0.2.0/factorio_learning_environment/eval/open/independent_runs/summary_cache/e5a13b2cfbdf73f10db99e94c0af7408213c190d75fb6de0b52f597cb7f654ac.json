{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes both iron ore into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the processed outputs.\n- Burner inserter at position (48.5, -81.5) placed adjacent to the furnace and rotated to face the wooden chest, facilitating the transfer of items between the furnace and chest.\nUpdates:\n- Steps 38\u201347 to 62: Managed and processed iron ore into iron plates with periodic inventory updates and experienced timeout delays.\n- Steps 64\u201365: An attempt to set up a dedicated copper smelting was made at (\u201328.5, \u201361.5) but failed due to insufficient inventory; the existing furnace was employed for copper ore insertion, although an entity reference error occurred.\n- Steps 66\u201367: Achieved copper ore insertion and subsequent production of copper plates and conversion into copper cables.\n- Steps 70\u201371: Successfully placed and rotated a burner inserter near the furnace; additional fuel handling was performed to address an \u201cout of fuel\u201d warning for the burner inserter.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Tile Occupation\n- Verify that target tiles are unoccupied before placing any entity near existing structures. For example, ensure that the intended location for a burner inserter has adequate space relative to the stone furnace and wooden chest to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Inventory and API Argument Management\n- Confirm sufficient inventory levels before attempting any placement operations.\n- Use correct entity references to prevent argument type errors during insertion actions.\n\n### Fuel and Entity State Management\n- Monitor fuel levels for entities in operation. The recent insertion of coal into the burner inserter highlights the need to proactively replenish fuel to address warnings.\n- Regularly update and check the state of entities to avoid operational delays or issues such as waiting for source items.\n\n### Timeout and Refresh Delays\n- Maintain timely updates for inventory and entity states, ensuring that any delays due to stale data or timeouts are minimized by refreshing information as needed."}
