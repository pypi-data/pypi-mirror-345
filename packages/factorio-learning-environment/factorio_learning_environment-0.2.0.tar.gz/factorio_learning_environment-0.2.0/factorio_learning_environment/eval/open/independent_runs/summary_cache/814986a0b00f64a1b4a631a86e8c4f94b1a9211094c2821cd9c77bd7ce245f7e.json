{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler requires water input and produces steam for the steam engine to generate electricity.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) and a stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0).\n- The burner mining drill extracts iron ore, which is then processed into iron plates in the stone furnace.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups that facilitate the transportation of fluids. The pipe groups are located at various positions, including:\n- PipeGroup (position -2.5, 3.5)\n- PipeGroup (position 0.5, 3.5)\n- PipeGroup (position 5.5, 2.5)\n- PipeGroup (position 1.5, 7.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -8.5, 24.5)\n\n### Storage chests\nConsists of multiple wooden chests located at:\n- Position (46.5, -83.5)\n- Position (48.5, -83.5)\n- Position (5.5, -79.5)\n- Position (10.5, -79.5)\n- Position (-4.5, -63.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Not enough pipes to connect Boiler and Steam Engine. Ensure you have enough pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect these entities.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Cannot place Offshore Pump as it is not in inventory. Ensure the Offshore Pump is in your inventory before trying to place it.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
