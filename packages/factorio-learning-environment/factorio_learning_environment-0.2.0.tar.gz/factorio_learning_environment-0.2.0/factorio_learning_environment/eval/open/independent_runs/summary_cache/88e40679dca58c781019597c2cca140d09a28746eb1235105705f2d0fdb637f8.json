{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate smelter at position (18.0, 71.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (18.0, 71.0)\n\n### Iron gear wheel factory at position (20.5, 71.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine 2 at position (20.5, 71.5)\n\n### Electricity generator\nConsists of a boiler at position (2.5, 0.0), a boiler at position (10.5, 0.0), a steam engine at position (3.5, 6.5), an offshore pump at position (-9.5, -2.5), and a pipe group connecting the offshore pump to the boilers and the steam engine.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure that the player is close enough to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables or calling integers as functions\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them and that they are not integers if you intend to call them as functions.\n\n### Errors when entities are not found\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position or that the list of entities is not empty before trying to access its elements.\n\n### Errors when entities are obstructed by other objects or terrain\n- Ensure that the target position is clear of other objects and that the terrain is placeable.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the item to be inserted is available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when entities are not connected to a power network\n- Ensure that entities that require power are connected to a power network.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item you are trying to extract.\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of objects\n- Ensure that the object has the attribute you are trying to access. For example, 'PipeGroup' object has no attribute 'fluid_box'.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: count of iron ore in the inventory (int)\n- `copper-ore`: count of copper ore in the inventory (int)\n- `coal`: count of coal in the inventory (int)\n- `iron-plate`: count of iron plates in the inventory (int)\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs."}
