{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Smelting: Iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Transfers iron plates from the furnace to the chest\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron plates\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5)\n  - Transfers iron plates from the chest to the transport belt\n- **Transport Belt Group**\n  - Connects the chest to the second burner inserter\n  - Belt from (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and from (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron plates\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5)\n  - Transfers iron plates from the transport belt to the end chest\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position if placement fails due to an existing entity.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect them to a transport belt.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources in inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to place or craft an entity. For example, ensure you have enough wooden chests or the raw materials to craft them.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without the required raw materials\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before attempting to craft an item. For instance, wood must be gathered as it cannot be crafted."}
