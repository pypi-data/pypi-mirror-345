{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been created on the map as of the latest execution steps. The entities on the map remain empty, indicating no placement of structures or entities has been successfully executed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using move_to function\n- Ensure that the indices used in the move_to function are integers. Avoid using strings as indices when attempting to move to a position.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target position is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Several attempts to place entities like Wooden Chests and Stone Furnaces failed due to occupied or unsuitable positions.\n\n### Errors in building box creation\n- When creating a building box, ensure that the dimensions are correctly specified as integers. Avoid using non-integer types or incorrect attributes when defining the width and height of the building box.\n\n### General Type Errors\n- When using functions that require integer arguments, ensure that the inputs are of the correct type. Avoid passing objects or attributes that cannot be directly converted to integers."}
