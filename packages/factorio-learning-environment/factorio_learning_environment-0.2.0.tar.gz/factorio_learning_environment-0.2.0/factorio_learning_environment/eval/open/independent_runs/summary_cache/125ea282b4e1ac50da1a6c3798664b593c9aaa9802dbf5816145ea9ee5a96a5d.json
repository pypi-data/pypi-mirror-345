{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the processed iron plates.\nUpdates:\n- Steps 38\u201347: Produced and extracted multiple batches of iron plates; experienced a temporary halt due to insufficient iron ore.\n- Steps 48\u201349: Inserted additional iron ore resulting in an inventory update showing 14 iron ore remaining, 5 iron plates processed, and 25 coal used as fuel.\n- Step 51: Insertion of 10 additional iron ore updated the furnace inventory to 7 iron ore and 15 iron plates after processing.\n- Step 52: Extracted 10 iron plates, updating the furnace inventory to 13 iron plates.\n- Steps 54\u201355: Harvested 10 iron ore and inserted into the furnace. Subsequent processing attempts resulted in consecutive timeouts with the furnace inventory eventually showing 22 iron plates. The furnace repeatedly reported no additional smelting progression despite waiting cycles, triggering timeout errors.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Timeout errors during smelting process\n- Avoid repeated waiting iterations without verifying that fuel and ingredients are consistently supplied. Investigate furnace conditions if production stalls over extended wait periods.\n\n### Insufficient resource availability and inventory mismanagement\n- Confirm resource quantities before insertions into processing structures to prevent intermittent halts.\n\n### Processing timing and ingredient replenishment delays\n- Align wait intervals with expected processing cycles and monitor ingredient levels to ensure smooth operation.\n\n### Stale entity status data usage\n- Regularly refresh entity data to ensure decisions are based on the current state of the map, particularly during critical processing stages.\n\n### Repeated stale map data display errors\n- Ensure that API calls provide current entity information, especially after inventory updates, to avoid reliance on outdated map snapshots."}
