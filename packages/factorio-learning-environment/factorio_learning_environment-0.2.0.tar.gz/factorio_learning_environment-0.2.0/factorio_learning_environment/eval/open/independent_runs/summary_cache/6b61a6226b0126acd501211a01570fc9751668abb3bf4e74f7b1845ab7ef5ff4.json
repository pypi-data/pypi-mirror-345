{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Two burner mining drills at (-19.0, -50.0) and (-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore\n- Two wooden chests at (-18.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) collecting mined ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0) smelting iron plates\n- Two input wooden chests at (-2.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) holding iron ore\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - At (-1.5, 0.5) moving ore from first chest to first furnace\n  - At (3.5, 0.5) moving ore from second chest to second furnace\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement Distance\n- Move closer to target location before placing entities - maximum placement distance is 10 tiles\n- The player position and target position distance must be within range\n\n### Errors with Resource Requirements\n- Ensure you have gathered required raw resources (like wood) before trying to craft items that need them\n- Check inventory has required items before attempting to place entities\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement Collisions\n- Check target location is clear before placing entities\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing to avoid collisions\n- Verify the terrain is suitable (not water) before placing mining drills\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Placement\n- Ensure mining drills are placed directly over resource patches\n- Check the entire mining area footprint has resources before placement\n\n### Errors with Item Insertion\n- Verify you have the items in inventory before trying to insert them into entities\n- When inserting fuel or materials, ensure you have gathered enough quantity first"}
