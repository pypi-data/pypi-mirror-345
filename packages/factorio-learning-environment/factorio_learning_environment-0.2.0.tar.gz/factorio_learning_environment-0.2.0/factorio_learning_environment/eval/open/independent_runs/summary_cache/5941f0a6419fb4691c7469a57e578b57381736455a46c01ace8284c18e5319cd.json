{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully built on the map. Multiple attempts were made to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) by either placing a new Lab or crafting one from available resources, but none resulted in a persistent structure. Although operations were performed with smelting devices\u2014such as a furnace retrieved at Position(5.0, 5.0) for iron smelting and a copper furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0) for copper processing\u2014these units appear to be pre\u2010existing and were not constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors with get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. passing radius=5) and ensure the number of positional parameters matches the function\u2019s signature.\n\u2022 Handling Null Returns:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that functions like get_entities return a valid list before iterating over the result to prevent issues such as attempting to iterate over a NoneType.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that a Lab is available in the inventory before trying to place it on the map.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, copper-plates) are sufficiently produced and available prior to initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2022 Resource Shortage Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify overall resource and sub-ingredient availability (including proper smelting operations) to prevent crafting failures due to missing prerequisites.\n\n"}
