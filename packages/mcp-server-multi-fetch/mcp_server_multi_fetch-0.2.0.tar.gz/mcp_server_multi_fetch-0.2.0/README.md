# Multi Fetch MCP Server

This project is based on the [Fetch MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch) by Anthropic


A Model Context Protocol server that provides web content fetching capabilities. This server enables LLMs to retrieve and process content from web pages, converting HTML to markdown for easier consumption.

The fetch tool will truncate the response, but by using the `start_index` argument, you can specify where to start the content extraction. This lets models read a webpage in chunks, until they find the information they need.

### Available Tools

 - `fetch` - Fetches a URL from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.
    - `url` (string, required): URL to fetch
 - `max_length` (integer, optional): Maximum number of characters to return (default: 50000)
    - `start_index` (integer, optional): Start content from this character index (default: 0)
    - `raw` (boolean, optional): Get raw content without markdown conversion (default: false)
 - `fetch_multi` - Fetches multiple URLs concurrently and returns an array of results. Input is an array of objects, each with:
    - `url` (string, required): URL to fetch
    - `max_length` (integer, optional): Maximum number of characters to return (default: 50000)
    - `start_index` (integer, optional): Start content from this character index (default: 0)
    - `raw` (boolean, optional): Get raw content without markdown conversion (default: false)

### Prompts

- **fetch**
  - Fetch a URL and extract its contents as markdown
  - Arguments:
    - `url` (string, required): URL to fetch

## Installation

Optionally: Install node.js, this will cause the fetch server to use a different HTML simplifier that is more robust.

### Using uv (recommended)

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed. We will
use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run *mcp-server-multi-fetch*.


## Configuration

### Configure for Claude.app

Add to your Claude settings:

<details>
<summary>Using uvx</summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "fetch": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["mcp-server-multi-fetch"]
  }
}
```
</details>

### Customization - robots.txt

By default, the server will obey a websites robots.txt file if the request came from the model (via a tool), but not if
the request was user initiated (via a prompt). This can be disabled by adding the argument `--ignore-robots-txt` to the
`args` list in the configuration.

### Customization - User-agent

By default, depending on if the request came from the model (via a tool), or was user initiated (via a prompt), the
server will use either the user-agent
```
ModelContextProtocol/1.0 (Autonomous; +https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
```
or
```
ModelContextProtocol/1.0 (User-Specified; +https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
```

This can be customized by adding the argument `--user-agent=YourUserAgent` to the `args` list in the configuration.

### Customization - Proxy

The server can be configured to use a proxy by using the `--proxy-url` argument.

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server. For uvx installations:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-multi-fetch
```

Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

```
cd path/to/servers/src/fetch
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-server-multi-fetch
```
