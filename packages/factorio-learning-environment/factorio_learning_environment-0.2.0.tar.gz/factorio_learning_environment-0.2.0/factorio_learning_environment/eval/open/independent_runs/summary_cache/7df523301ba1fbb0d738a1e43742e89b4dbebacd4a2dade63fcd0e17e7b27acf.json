{"content": "###  EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction and Processing at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a Pumpjack (position: x=17.5, y=40.5), Oil Refinery (position: x=23.5, y=43.5), Storage Tank (position: x=29.5, y=44.5), Chemical Plant (position: x=29.5, y=49.5), and associated pipes and power poles. The Oil Refinery and Chemical Plant are connected to the power network via the Electricity Group (id=65276, poles=[...]).\n\n### Electricity Generation at position (0.5, 0.0)\nConsists of a Boiler (position: x=0.5, y=0.0) and associated pipes. The Boiler is fueled with coal.\n\n### Water Supply at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an Offshore Pump (position: x=-9.5, y=-0.5) and associated pipes.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple Pipe Groups:\n- Pipe Group (fluid=water, position=x=-8.5 y=-0.5, status=EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT)\n- Pipe Group (fluid=steam, position=x=-5.5 y=0.5, status=EntityStatus.EMPTY)\n- Pipe Group (fluid=crude-oil, position=x=19.5 y=38.5, status=EntityStatus.EMPTY)\n- Pipe Group (position=x=25.5 y=40.5, status=EntityStatus.EMPTY)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when using entities without power\n  - Ensure that entities requiring power are connected to a power network.\n* Errors when connecting entities without fluid in the source entity\n  - Ensure that the source entity has fluid in it before attempting to connect it to another entity that requires fluid input.\n* Errors when entities are not connected properly\n  - Ensure that entities are connected properly.\n* Errors when accessing list indices out of range\n  - Ensure that list indices are within the valid range before accessing them.\n* Errors when using undefined variables or attributes\n  - Ensure that all variables and attributes are defined before using them. Specifically, check the documentation for the correct attribute names.\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied or unplaceable positions\n  - Ensure that the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when connecting entities with invalid connections\n  - Ensure that the source and target entities are correctly connected and that the connections are not blocked.\n* Errors when entities are not receiving required ingredients\n  - Ensure that the required ingredients are available and inserted into the entity.\n* Errors when accessing attributes of incorrect type\n  - Ensure that the attribute exists for the given entity type. For example, 'ElectricityGroup' object has no attribute 'neighbours', use the correct attribute or check the entity type before accessing the attribute.\n* Errors when using 'tuple' object as if it had an attribute 'value'\n  - Ensure that the correct data type is being used. The function get_entities() is expected to return an iterable of entities, not a tuple.\n* Errors when using undefined variables\n  - Ensure that variables are defined before using them. For example, 'chemical_plant' is not defined, 'entity' is not defined, 'new_boiler' is not defined, 'output' is not defined.\n* Errors when inserting items into entities without having the required items in inventory\n  - Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n* Errors when rearranging power generation\n  - Ensure that a suitable position is found for the boiler and steam engine before attempting to place them.\n* Errors when checking positions for entity placement\n  - Ensure that the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when clearing area/placing steam engine\n  - Ensure that the area is cleared before attempting to place the steam engine.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables that have been assigned:\n- `storage_tank`: StorageTank entity\n- `chemical_plant`: ChemicalPlant entity\n- `oil_refinery`: OilRefinery entity\n- `boiler`: Boiler entity\n- `steam_engine`: SteamEngine entity (not defined in some steps)\n- `offshore_pump`: OffshorePump entity\n- `pumpjack`: Pumpjack entity\n- `pipes`: list of Pipe entities\n- `power_poles`: list of SmallElectricPole entities\n- `new_boiler`: Boiler entity (not defined in some steps)"}
