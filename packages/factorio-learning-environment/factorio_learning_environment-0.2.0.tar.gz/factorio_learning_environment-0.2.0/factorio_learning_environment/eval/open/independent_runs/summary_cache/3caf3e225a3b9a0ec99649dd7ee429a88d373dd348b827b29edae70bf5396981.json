{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nThis structure is responsible for generating electricity and consists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes at positions such as (-5.5, 16.5), (-4.5, 16.5), and (-2.5, 22.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nThis structure is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates and consists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Unsupported Operand Types\n- Ensure that all operands in arithmetic operations are of compatible types. For example, avoid adding 'ModelPrivateAttr' to an 'int'.\n\n### Errors when Crafting Items without Required Ingredients\n- Verify that all necessary sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For instance, crafting a steam engine requires iron plates and iron gear wheels, which in turn require iron plates.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities without Inventory\n- Check that the required entity is present in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, attempting to place a small electric pole without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities without Required Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory to connect entities, such as pipes for connecting a boiler to a steam engine.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Inventory\n- Confirm that the item you are attempting to insert into another entity is available in your inventory, such as coal for fueling a boiler."}
