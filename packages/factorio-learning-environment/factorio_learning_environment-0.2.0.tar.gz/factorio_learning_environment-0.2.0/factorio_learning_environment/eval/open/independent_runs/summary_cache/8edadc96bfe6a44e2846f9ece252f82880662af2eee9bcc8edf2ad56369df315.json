{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining and processing iron ore into iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring resources from chests to furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5) and (-8.5, -47.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for storing processed iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nThis facility is used for storing iron plates produced by the furnaces. It consists of:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), and (-5.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -45.5) for managing the storage of iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and refill the source entities as needed.\n\n#### Furnace Belt at Drop Position is Blocked\n- Ensure that the destination for items being dropped by inserters is clear and has enough space to accommodate the incoming items. Regularly clear out the destination to prevent blockages.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to receive items from the inserter. Regularly clear or manage the inventory of destination entities to prevent overflow.\n\n#### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel burner entities to ensure continuous operation. Plan for efficient coal distribution to prevent interruptions in the production process."}
