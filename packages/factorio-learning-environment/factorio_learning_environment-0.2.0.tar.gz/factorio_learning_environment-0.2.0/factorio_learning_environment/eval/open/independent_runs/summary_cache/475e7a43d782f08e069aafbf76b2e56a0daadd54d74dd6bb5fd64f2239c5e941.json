{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with the following attributes:\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: Full Output\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (9 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Copper Plate (4 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting without required resources\n- Ensure you have gathered all necessary resources before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting Assembling Machine 1 requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and electronic circuits, which were missing in some attempts.\n\n### Errors when crafting without unlocked technology\n- Before crafting items that require specific technologies, ensure that you have researched the necessary technology. For instance, the Assembling Machine 1 requires the automation technology to be unlocked.\n\n### Errors when crafting items that require a crafting machine or smelting\n- Some items cannot be crafted directly and require a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace. Ensure you have the appropriate setup for items like iron plates and copper cables.\n\n### Errors when extracting from non-existent or empty entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to extract from exists and contains the required item. For example, attempts to extract copper plates and iron plates from a stone furnace failed due to the absence of the required items.\n\n### Errors when interacting with non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to interact with exists at the specified position. For example, attempting to get a Lab at a position where none exists will result in an error."}
