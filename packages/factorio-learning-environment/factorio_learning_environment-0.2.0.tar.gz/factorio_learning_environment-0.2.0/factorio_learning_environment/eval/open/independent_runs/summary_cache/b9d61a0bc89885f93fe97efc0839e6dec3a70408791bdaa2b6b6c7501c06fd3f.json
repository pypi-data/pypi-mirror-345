For example, the variable 'x' should be associated with a value before being accessed.\n\n### Errors with Item Insertion\n- Verify that the target entity has enough space to accommodate the items being inserted. For example, ensure that furnaces and chests are not full before inserting items.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Keep track of inventory levels to avoid inserters waiting unnecessarily."}
