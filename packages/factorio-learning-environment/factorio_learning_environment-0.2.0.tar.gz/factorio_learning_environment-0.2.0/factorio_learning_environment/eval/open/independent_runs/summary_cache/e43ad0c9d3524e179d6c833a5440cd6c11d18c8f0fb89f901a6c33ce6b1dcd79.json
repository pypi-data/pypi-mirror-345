{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a furnace result inventory containing iron-plates.\n\n### Offshore Pump Setup\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) which is currently not connected to any fluid system.\n\n### Lab Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs but currently without power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting or Inserting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity contains the required items before attempting to extract. For example, attempting to extract iron-plate or iron-ore from a stone furnace that does not contain them will result in an error.\n- Verify that the entity has space for additional items before inserting. Attempting to insert items into a full inventory will fail.\n- Ensure that the correct type of item is being inserted into the correct type of entity. For instance, inserting iron-plate into a furnace already containing iron-ore will not work.\n\n### Errors in Crafting\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting a steam engine requires a specific number of iron plates, iron gear wheels, and pipes.\n- Unlock necessary technologies before attempting to craft items that require them. For instance, crafting a solar panel requires the solar-energy technology to be researched first.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the entity before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place an offshore pump without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors in Calculating Dimensions\n- When performing calculations involving dimensions, ensure that the operands are compatible types. For instance, attempting to add an integer to a 'ModelPrivateAttr' type will result in a TypeError.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the inventory and entity statuses to ensure that all necessary resources and connections are in place for efficient operation.\n- Address warnings and status issues, such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" or \"no fluid present in connections,\" to maintain optimal functionality of structures."}
