{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a basic iron processing structure:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 72.5) collecting iron ore from the mining drill\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 73.5) feeding iron ore from the wooden chest into the stone furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 74.5) extracting iron plates from the stone furnace\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 75.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace output\n- Small electric poles at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5) providing electricity to inserters and other entities\n\nThis structure is intended to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and collect the output for further use.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect direction argument when placing entities\n- When placing entities that require a direction parameter, ensure to pass a Direction enum object rather than a raw integer or other type. For example, use `Direction.DOWN` instead of `Dir.DOWN.value`.\n\n### Failure to connect entities with electric poles due to invalid references\n- When connecting entities with poles, verify that the entities exist and are correctly referenced before attempting connection.\n- Ensure the connection function handles cases where entities might not have the expected fields or are nil.\n\n### Extracting items from empty or non-existent inventories\n- Before extracting items from a chest or container, confirm that the container actually contains the requested item to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Fuel management for burner entities\n- Burner mining drills and burner inserters require fuel (coal) to operate. Ensure coal is inserted into these entities promptly to avoid stoppage.\n- Maintain sufficient coal inventory to insert into entities when needed.\n\n### Inventory synchronization issues\n- Inventory updates must be tracked carefully; attempting to insert items when inventory is empty or insufficient will cause exceptions.\n- Always check current inventory counts before attempting insertions.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
