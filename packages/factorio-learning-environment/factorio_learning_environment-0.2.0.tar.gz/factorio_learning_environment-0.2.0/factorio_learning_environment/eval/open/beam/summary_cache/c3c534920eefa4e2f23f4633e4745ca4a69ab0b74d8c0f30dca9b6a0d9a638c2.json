I need to gather more stone to proceed.\n  \n### Next Steps:\n1. **Gather Additional Stone**: I will need to locate and harvest **more stone resources** to ensure I have enough for the furnace.\n2. **Reload the Furnace**: Once I collect enough stone, I will insert both the required stone and the Copper Ore back into the furnace for processing.\n3. **Check Processing Activation**: Finally, I will verify if the furnace begins smelting after all materials are loaded.\n\nLet's proceed to find and gather more stone resources. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Find the nearest stone resource patch for gathering additional stone\nstone_resource_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\n\n# Move to collect more stone resources\nmove_to(stone_resource_position)  # Navigate to the nearest Stone resource location \n\n# Harvest the required additional pieces of stone (aiming for 4 more)\nharvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), quantity=4)  # Attempting to gather 4 more pieces of stone \n\n# Check the overall inventory again after harvesting to confirm collected stone\noverall_inventory_after_harvesting_additional_stone = inspect_inventory()  # Check overall inventory after harvest.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after harvesting additional stone: {overall_inventory_after_harvesting_additional_stone}\")  # Confirm total inventory after harvesting stone.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-458]"}
