{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 1.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to both stone furnaces.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 1.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace at position (2.0, 0.0).\n\n### Storage Area\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 1.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 1.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, 1.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is not already occupied by another object. Consider adjusting the position or removing the existing object before placement.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are properly defined before use. Double-check the spelling and initialization of variables like `first_chest`.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure you have coal or iron ore before inserting them into furnaces or inserters.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Confirm the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to interact with it. Use checks or conditions to ensure that the entity is present and correctly identified.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect API calls\n- Review API documentation to ensure correct usage of functions and methods. Ensure that function parameters are correctly specified and that the function is suitable for the intended operation."}
