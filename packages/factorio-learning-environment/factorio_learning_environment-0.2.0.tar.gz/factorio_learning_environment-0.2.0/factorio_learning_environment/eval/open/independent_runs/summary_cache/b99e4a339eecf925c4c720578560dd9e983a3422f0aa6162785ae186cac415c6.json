{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generation system at x=-25.0 y=80.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at x=-20.5 y=69.5 (now properly connected)\n- Boiler at x=-25.0 y=80.5 (now working and connected)\n- Steam engine at x=-25.5 y=89.5 (now working with 15kW output)\n- Complete pipe network with two fluid systems:\n  - Water system (ID 1195) connecting pump to boiler\n  - Steam system (ID 1199) connecting boiler to engine\n\n### Iron mining operation at x=15.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=15.5 y=70.5 (currently no power)\n- Stone furnace at x=16.0 y=74.0 (no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at x=15.5 y=72.5 (working but missing from some steps)\n- Wooden chest at x=15.5 y=75.5 (empty output storage)\n\n### Copper mining operation at x=-46.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=-46.5 y=70.5 (output blocked)\n- Stone furnace at x=-46.0 y=74.0 (no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at x=-46.5 y=72.5 (working with fuel)\n- Wooden chest at x=-46.5 y=76.5 (empty output storage)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity verification failures\n- Verify entity existence before operations (repeated attempts to access non-existent burner inserter at x=15.5 y=72.5)\n- Check entity positions before attempting modifications (multiple failed get_entity calls)\n\n### Placement issues\n- Move closer before placing entities (failed electric mining drill placement due to distance)\n- Ensure target position is clear before placing entities\n- Verify terrain suitability for placement (stone furnace placement failed in water)\n\n### Production chain problems\n- Clear output blockages on mining drills (both drills show \"output blocked\" warnings)\n- Ensure proper fuel supply for burner inserters\n- Verify furnace ingredient supply (both furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\")\n\n### Power system issues\n- Connect electric mining drills to power (iron drill shows \"no power\")\n- Verify proper pipe network connections (now resolved but was an issue)\n\n### Entity management\n- Maintain consistent entity tracking (apparent disappearance/reappearance of furnaces)\n- Verify inserter positions and connections (multiple failed inserter operations)\n\n### System verification\n- Implement pre-placement checks using can_place (could prevent many placement failures)\n- Verify system states before operations (fluid connections, power supply, etc.)\n\n### API usage errors\n- Use correct prototype names ('PipeToGround' vs 'PipeGroup')\n- Verify connection requirements before attempting connections (steam engine connection attempts)"}
