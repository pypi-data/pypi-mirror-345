{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n#### Furnace at position (60.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a stone-furnace at position (60.0, -60.0) and a burner-inserter at position (60.5, -61.5).\n\n#### Offshore Pump at position (107.5, -33.5)\nConsists of an offshore-pump at position (107.5, -33.5) and a pipe group connecting it to a boiler at position (111.5, -32.0).\n\n#### Boiler at position (111.5, -32.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position (111.5, -32.0) and a pipe group connecting it to the offshore-pump at position (107.5, -33.5) and a steam-engine at position (117.5, -30.5).\n\n#### Steam Engine at position (117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of a steam-engine at position (117.5, -30.5) and a small-electric-pole at position (119.5, -30.5), with a pipe group connecting it to the boiler at position (111.5, -32.0).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when placing entities too far away**: Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to place an entity before attempting to place it.\n* **Errors when connecting entities**: Ensure that the entities are close enough to each other and that the connection points are valid before attempting to connect them.\n* **Errors when using connect_entities function**: Provide more than one waypoint when using the connect_entities function to connect entities.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* **Utility functions**:\n\t+ `place_entity`: Places an entity at a specified position. Failure modes: entity cannot be placed at the specified position due to distance or obstruction. Success modes: entity is successfully placed at the specified position.\n\t+ `connect_entities`: Connects two entities using a pipe. Failure modes: entities are not close enough, connection points are invalid, or waypoints are not provided. Success modes: entities are successfully connected using a pipe.\n* **Important variables**:\n\t+ `transport-belt`: Type: int, Value: 8\n\t+ `burner-inserter`: Type: int, Value: 1\n\t+ `small-electric-pole`: Type: int, Value: 1\n\t+ `stone-furnace`: Type: int, Value: 1\n\t+ `coal`: Type: int, Value: 106\n\t+ `copper-ore`: Type: int, Value: 20\n\t+ `iron-plate`: Type: int, Value: 613\n\t+ `copper-plate`: Type: int, Value: 5\n\t+ `copper-cable`: Type: int, Value: 2\n\t+ `iron-gear-wheel`: Type: int, Value: 2"}
