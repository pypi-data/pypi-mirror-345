{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) intended to move items from the chest to the furnace, currently waiting for source items.\n\n### Coal Processing Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) moving coal from the chest to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) intended to move items, currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Several inserters at positions (52.5, -79.5), (52.5, -76.5), (-11.5, -48.5), (-8.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -46.5) are waiting for source items. Ensure that the source entities have items to be moved or check for blockages that might be preventing item flow.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- The burner mining drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) has issued a warning that the chest at drop position (-11.5, -49.5) is full. Regularly empty the chest to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- The stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) has issued a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt. Ensure a steady supply of iron ore to maintain production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
