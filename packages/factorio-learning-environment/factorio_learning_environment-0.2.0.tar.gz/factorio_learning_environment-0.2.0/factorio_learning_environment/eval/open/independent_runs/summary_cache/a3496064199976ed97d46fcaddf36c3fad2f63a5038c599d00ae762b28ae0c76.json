Iron plate smelting\n  2. Gear wheel production\n  3. Lab assembly\n\n#### Smelting system issues\n- Repeated inserter placement failures at (39.0, 0.0):\n  - Existing object blocking placement\n  - Distance violation (39 tiles)\n- Solution:\n  - Verify clear placement area\n  - Move within 10 tiles before building\n  - Use ghost placement preview\n\n#### Resource location errors\n- Failed to find iron ore at (50.0, 0.0)\n- Solution:\n  - Survey area with radar/scout first\n  - Check minimap for resource patches\n  - Verify coordinates against exploration data\n\n#### Production chain gaps\n- Multiple crafting failures due to missing intermediates:\n  - Iron plates for gears\n  - Copper plates for science packs\n- Solution:\n  - Build complete supply chains before attempting advanced crafts\n  - Maintain buffer stocks of key materials\n  - Implement production monitoring\n\n#### Entity management\n- Lost track of iron furnace at (40.0, 0.0)\n- Solution:\n  - Maintain entity registry\n  - Implement periodic system scans\n  - Use blueprint book for critical layouts\n\n#### Maintenance best practices\nCurrent successful systems:\n- Fuel level tracking (drills: 30/29 coal)\n- Production rate monitoring (42 coal/min)\n- Storage utilization tracking (2.1%)\nRecommended upgrades:\n- Automated low-fuel alerts\n- Production balancing system\n- Predictive maintenance scheduling"}
