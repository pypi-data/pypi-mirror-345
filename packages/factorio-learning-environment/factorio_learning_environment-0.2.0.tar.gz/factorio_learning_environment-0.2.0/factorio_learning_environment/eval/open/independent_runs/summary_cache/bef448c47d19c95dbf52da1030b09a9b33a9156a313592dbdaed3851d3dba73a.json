{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far from Player\n- Ensure you are within a 10-tile radius of the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of resources, as seen with the inserter failing to supply the furnace with iron ore.\n\n### Fuel Management for Entities\n- Regularly refuel entities like inserters and mining drills to maintain operational efficiency. An inserter without fuel will not function, leading to resource transfer issues.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor the inventory of chests and other storage entities to prevent overflow or depletion. Ensure that chests have sufficient space to accommodate incoming resources and are not empty when they should be supplying materials."}
