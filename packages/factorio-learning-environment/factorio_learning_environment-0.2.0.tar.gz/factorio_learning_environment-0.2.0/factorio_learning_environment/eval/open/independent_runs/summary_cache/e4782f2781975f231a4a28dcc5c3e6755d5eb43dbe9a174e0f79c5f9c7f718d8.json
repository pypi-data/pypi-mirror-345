{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) facing DOWN\n- Output chest at (15.5, 72.5)\n- Connected to small electric pole at (17.5, 69.5)\n- Currently not powered (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (-46.5, 70.5) facing DOWN\n- Output chest at (-46.5, 72.5)\n- Connected to small electric pole at (-44.5, 69.5)\n- Currently not powered (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Water Supply System\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) facing RIGHT\n- Extensive pipe network extending from (-8.5, -0.5) to (30.5, 63.5)\n- Currently working (status: WORKING) with water flowing\n\n### Power Generation Area (Under Construction)\n- Area cleared for new boiler and steam engine placement\n- Existing pipe groups present but not properly connected\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Errors (Repeated)\n- Cannot place pipes/boilers on occupied tiles - verify position is clear before placing\n- Attempted to place pipe at (20.5, 69.5) and (21.5, 69.5) on occupied tiles\n- Attempted to place boiler at (19.0, 69.5) on occupied tile\n\n### Fluid System Connection Errors\n- Failed to connect offshore pump to boiler location (x=19.0, y=69.5)\n  - Ensure continuous pipe path exists between source and destination\n  - Verify all connection points are accessible\n  - Consider using pipe-to-ground for long distances\n\n### Entity Management Errors\n- Attempted to access non-existent boiler at (19.0, 69.5)\n  - Always verify entity exists before accessing\n  - Use proper entity detection methods before operations\n\n### General Tips (Updated)\n- When rebuilding systems, completely clear the area first\n- Plan pipe routes carefully considering all connection points\n- Verify fluid systems are properly connected before placing dependent machines\n- Check entity positions and orientations match connection requirements\n- For long-distance fluid transport, consider using underground pipes"}
