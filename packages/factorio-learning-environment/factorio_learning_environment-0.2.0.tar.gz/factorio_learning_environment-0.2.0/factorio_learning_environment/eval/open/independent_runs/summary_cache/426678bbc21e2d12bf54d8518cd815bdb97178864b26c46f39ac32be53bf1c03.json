{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0)\n- Boiler at position (x not specified)\n- Offshore pump at position (x not specified)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (8.5, 1.5)\n- Furnace at position (10.0, 1.0)\n- Chest at position (3.5, 3.5)\n- Chest at position (3.5, 5.5)\n\n### Offshore water extraction system at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe group connected to the offshore pump\n\n### Electricity distribution network\nConsists of:\n- Small electric poles placed at positions (50.5, 49.5), (50.5, 54.5), (52.5, 49.5), (52.5, 55.5)\n- Additional electric poles at positions (52.5, 49.0), (52.5, 54.0), (50.0, 49.0), (50.0, 54.0), (52.5, 50.0), (52.5, 55.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any obstacles, including other entities or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water).\n- The agent consistently faced issues placing electric poles at coordinates (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0). Ensure to check the area for any blocking entities before attempting to place again.\n- New issues with placing electric poles at (50.0, 49.0), (50.0, 54.0), (52.5, 50.0), and (52.5, 55.0) have been noted. Verify the area for obstructions before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to retrieve (e.g., steam engine) exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. If the entity is not found, check if it has been placed correctly or if the coordinates are accurate.\n- The steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0) could not be found. Ensure that the entity is correctly placed and not removed or destroyed.\n\n### General tips\n- Regularly check the inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for construction and placement.\n- Keep track of the positions of your entities to avoid confusion and misplaced actions."}
