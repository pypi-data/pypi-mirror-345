{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine generates electricity by converting steam produced by the boiler, which is fueled by coal.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory at position (-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) to the assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities you are trying to connect (e.g., steam engine and boiler) are within the allowable range for connection. Check the distance and alignment before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
