{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -11.5, 25.0) connected to:\n  - Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n  - Steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5)\n- Pipes connecting the boiler to the offshore pump and steam engine.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Lab at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position x, status: NO_POWER)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric poles\n- Ensure that electric poles are properly connected to the electric network to avoid power issues with entities like labs and generators.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that entities such as offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines are placed correctly to allow for proper connections. Check for placement issues before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors when entities are not receiving power\n- Verify that all power-consuming entities are connected to a functioning power network. If an entity is not receiving power, check the connections and the status of nearby electric poles.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
