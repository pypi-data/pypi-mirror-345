{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to mine and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores the mined iron ore from the burner mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters with Incorrect Spacing or Direction\n- Verify that there is sufficient space and correct direction for placing inserters next to other entities. Adjust the spacing or change the direction if there are collisions with existing entities or if the area is unsuitable for placement.\n\n### Errors Due to Inserter Setup Not Functioning\n- Regularly check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials, disrupting the production process.\n\n### Errors when Entity Placement is Blocked by Other Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. If an entity is blocking the placement, consider repositioning existing entities to create space."}
