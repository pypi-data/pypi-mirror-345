{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line at position(8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position(8.5, 13.5)\n- Input system for iron gears:\n  - Wooden chest at position(7.5, 10.5) containing iron gears\n  - Burner inserter at position(8.5, 10.5)\n- Input system for copper plates:\n  - Wooden chest at position(8.5, 8.5) containing copper plates\n  - Burner inserter at position(8.5, 9.5)\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter at position(10.5, 13.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position(11.5, 13.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting various parts with 11 belts\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-3.5, 27.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting power consumers\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at various locations:\n1. Setup at position(41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n2. Setup at position(-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter and furnace system\n\n3. Setup at position(-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Associated chest and inserter system\n   - Furnace with output collection\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Consider different directions or increased spacing when placing entities near assembling machines\n- Pay attention to entity dimensions when placing near larger structures like furnaces\n\n### Transport Belt Conflicts\n- Avoid placing inserters where transport belts already exist\n- When placing entities near belts, ensure proper spacing or choose different directions\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Keep boilers fueled to maintain consistent power supply\n- Monitor steam and water levels in the power generation system\n\n### Resource Input/Output Issues\n- Ensure proper placement of input/output inserters relative to assembling machines\n- Verify chest positions are accessible to inserters\n- Check that inserter drop and pickup positions are correctly aligned with target entities\n\n### Entity Spacing Issues\n- Consider the tile dimensions of entities when planning layouts\n- Leave adequate space between production lines\n- Account for larger entities like assembling machines (3x3) when placing adjacent structures"}
