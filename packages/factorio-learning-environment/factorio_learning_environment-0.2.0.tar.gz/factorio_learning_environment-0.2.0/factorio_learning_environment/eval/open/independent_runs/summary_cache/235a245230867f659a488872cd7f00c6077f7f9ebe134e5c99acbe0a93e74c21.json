{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with both their pickup and drop positions. Misalignment can prevent items from being transferred effectively.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to pick up items from the chest and drop them into the furnace. Check the inserter's pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Errors When Using Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid exceptions related to missing items.\n\n### Refueling and Energy Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt production processes."}
