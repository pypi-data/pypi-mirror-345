{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for power distribution\n\n### Laboratory Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source and have sufficient energy to operate. Check the connectivity of electric poles and ensure they are supplying power to the inserters.\n\n### Incorrect Function Usage\n- When using functions like `nearest()`, ensure that the correct number of arguments are passed as required by the function definition. Double-check the function signature to avoid TypeErrors.\n\n### Missing Ingredients in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and supply the required raw materials to maintain continuous production."}
