{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15, -50)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Iron chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-13.5, -49.5), (-18.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), (-9.5, -49.5)\n- Stone furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), (-9.0, -48.0)\n\n### Coal Storage and Processing at Position (47.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), (49.5, -80.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5), (41.5, -78.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Refuel inserters regularly to avoid stoppages.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining and production stoppages. Specifically, empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) and (41.5, -80.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure all furnaces and mining drills are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation."}
