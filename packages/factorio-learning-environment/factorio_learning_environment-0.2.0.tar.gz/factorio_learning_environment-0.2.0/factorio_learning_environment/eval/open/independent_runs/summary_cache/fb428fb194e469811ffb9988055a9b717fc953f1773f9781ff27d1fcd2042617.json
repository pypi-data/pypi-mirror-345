{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-7.5, 25.5)\n- Multiple small electric poles at positions(-0.5, -11.5), (-1.5, -11.5), (1.5, -10.5), (1.5, -11.5), (-2.5, -8.5), (-2.5, -9.5), (1.5, -9.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position(y1) to the assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities being connected are valid and within range. Check the coordinates and ensure they are not too far apart.\n- If a connection fails, consider repositioning the entities or adding additional pipes to bridge the gap.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
