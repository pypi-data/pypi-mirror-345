{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-47.5, -123.5) connected to a **Pipe** at position (-47.5, -122.5). This setup is intended to supply water for steam power generation.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -77.5). The chest is currently full, preventing further mining.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-19.0, -73.0), (9.0, -64.0), and (6.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. All furnaces are currently without ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Inserter and Storage\n- **Inserter** at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (6.5, -59.5). The inserter is not receiving electricity, affecting its operation.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Small Electric Poles** at various positions, intended to distribute power but currently not connected to a power source.\n\n### Research Facility\n- **Lab** with input of automation science packs, currently not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple **Pipe Groups** at various positions, mostly empty and not currently in use.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Steam Engines\n- Ensure there is sufficient space for placing steam engines. Consider reducing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to find a viable position.\n\n### Connection Errors in Power Network\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities in the power network.\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are used for mining outputs to prevent halting of mining operations.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all components of your power network are properly connected and supplied with power to avoid operational disruptions."}
