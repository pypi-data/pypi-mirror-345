{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest step execution logs. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but no successful placements have been recorded.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Errors such as \"Cannot place a Transport Belt at x=65.0 y=-105.0\", \"Cannot place a Stone Furnace at x=5.0 y=5.0\", and \"Cannot place a Wooden Chest at x=0.0 y=0.0\" suggest that the target tiles may already be occupied or unsuitable for placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at incorrect positions\n- Verify the coordinates and ensure they are within the valid range and suitable for the intended entity. Errors like \"Cannot place a Burner Inserter at x=-50.0 y=50.0\" and \"Cannot place a Burner Inserter at x=-100.0 y=100.0\" indicate attempts to place entities at potentially invalid or inaccessible positions.\n\n### General Placement Tips\n- Before placing any entity, ensure the area is clear and suitable for the specific type of entity you are trying to place. Double-check the coordinates for accuracy and ensure they align with your construction plan."}
