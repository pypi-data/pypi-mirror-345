For example, trying to insert coal into the iron furnace without having coal in your inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Non-Existent or Empty Entities\n- Verify the presence and contents of entities before attempting to extract items. An attempt to extract iron ore from a wooden chest failed because the chest did not contain iron ore.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into a specified entity. Ensure the item exists in the inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n- `extract_item`: Used to extract items from a specified entity. Ensure the entity exists and contains the item to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n- `iron_chest`: Represents the wooden chest associated with iron ore storage.\n- `iron_chest_inventory`: Represents the inventory of the iron chest."}
