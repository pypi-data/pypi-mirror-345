{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) that is currently working and requires coal as fuel. It has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5) where it deposits mined resources.\n\n### Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) that is currently working but has no ingredients to smelt. It requires iron ore to function.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**: \n  - Ensure to empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) before continuing mining with the burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0).\n  \n- **Errors when the furnace has no ingredients**: \n  - Make sure to insert iron ore into the furnace at (-15.0, -50.0) to allow it to function properly.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Type-annotated utility functions**: None defined or invoked.\n- **Important variables assigned**:\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int"}
