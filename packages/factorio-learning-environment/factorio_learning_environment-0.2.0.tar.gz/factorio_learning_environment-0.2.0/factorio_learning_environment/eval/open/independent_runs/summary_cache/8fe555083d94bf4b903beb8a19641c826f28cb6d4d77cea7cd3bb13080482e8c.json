{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working and fueled by coal.\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and producing iron plates.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently working.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently working.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Multiple wooden and iron chests are used for storage of iron plates and iron ore, located at various positions such as (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -50.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chests positioned at (-5.5, -52.5) and (-2.5, -52.5) are used for storing iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource Shortages\n- **Coal and Iron Ore Availability**: Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of coal and iron ore in the inventory to refuel mining drills and supply furnaces. Regularly check and replenish these resources to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- **Insertion Errors**: When attempting to insert items into a furnace or any other entity, ensure that the inventory contains the required items to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Chest Management\n- **Full Chest Warnings**: Monitor the status of chests used for collecting resources from mining drills. Empty the chests regularly to prevent stoppage of mining operations due to full inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It failed due to a lack of iron ore in the inventory. Ensure the inventory has the required items before invoking this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **inventory**: A dictionary containing the current inventory status, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
