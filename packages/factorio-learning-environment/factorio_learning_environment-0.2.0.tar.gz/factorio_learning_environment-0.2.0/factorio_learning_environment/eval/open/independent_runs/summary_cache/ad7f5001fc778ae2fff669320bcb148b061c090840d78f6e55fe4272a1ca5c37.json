{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Smelting Area at Position(0,0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0,0) with coal fuel and iron plate output\n- Furnace at (2,0) with coal fuel\n\n###Smelting Area at Position(4,4)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (4,4) with coal fuel\n- Furnace at (6,4) with coal fuel\n\n###Inserter Production Line at Position(23.5,2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at (23.5,2.5) making inserters\n- Input burner inserter at (21.5,2.5) with coal fuel\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5,2.5) with coal fuel\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5,2.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (26.5,2.5) containing 166 inserters\n\n###Power Generation System at Position(-2.5,24)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,24.5) producing water\n- Boiler at (-2.5,24) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine at (4.5,24.5) generating power\n- Connected pipe network carrying water and steam\n- Small electric poles at (2.5,24.5) and (6.5,24.5) distributing power\n\n###Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs connected to power grid:\n- Several labs with automation and logistic science packs\n- Some labs without power connection\n- Labs distributed across the map sharing research progress\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to craft without required materials\n- Ensure you have all required raw materials before attempting to craft items\n- For items requiring machine crafting (like iron plates), use appropriate production buildings instead of manual crafting\n\n### Errors with power system connectivity\n- Steam engines require proper pipe connections to receive steam from boilers\n- Ensure you have pipes in inventory before attempting connections\n- Power poles must be properly connected to form electrical network\n\n### Errors with inserter/assembler operation\n- Assemblers need consistent power supply to operate\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available in input inventory\n- Check that input/output inserters have fuel if they are burner type\n\n### Inventory management errors\n- Verify inventory has required items before attempting insertions\n- Keep track of fuel (coal) levels for burner devices\n- Maintain adequate raw material supply for continuous production\n\n### Building placement errors\n- Verify space is available before placing new structures\n- Check entity connections and orientations match intended layout\n- Ensure proper spacing between buildings for inserter reach"}
