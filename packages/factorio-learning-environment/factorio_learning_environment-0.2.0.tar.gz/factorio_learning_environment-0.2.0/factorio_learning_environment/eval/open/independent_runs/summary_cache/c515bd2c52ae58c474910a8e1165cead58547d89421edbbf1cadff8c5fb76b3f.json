{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. All attempted placements\u2014most notably the Lab intended for research supply at position (0.5, 2.5)\u2014have failed. Although furnaces (such as one noted at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were referenced during resource processing, these entities are not reflected in the current map state.\n\nERROR TIPS\n- API Usage for get_entities\n  - Call the function using its correct signature. Do not include unsupported keywords (e.g., remove 'radius') and avoid passing extra positional arguments.\n  - Incorporate checks to handle cases when get_entities returns None (fallback to an empty list) to prevent iteration errors.\n- Lab Crafting and Placement\n  - Verify that a Lab is available in the inventory before attempting to place one on the map.\n  - Ensure that all prerequisite sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable, and related components) are available through proper resource processing before initiating Lab crafting.\n  - Guard against None-type errors by validating the returned list of Lab entities prior to iterating over them.\n- Resource Processing\n  - Confirm that raw resources are sufficiently produced and correctly smelted (e.g., iron-plate and copper-plate production) to support the crafting of compound items.\n  - Monitor the completion of smelting operations to guarantee that all necessary materials are in place for subsequent crafting attempts."}
