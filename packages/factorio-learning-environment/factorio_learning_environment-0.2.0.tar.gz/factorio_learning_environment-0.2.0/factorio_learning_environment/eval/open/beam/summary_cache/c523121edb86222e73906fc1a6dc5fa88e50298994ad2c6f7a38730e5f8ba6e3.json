{"content": "The error message indicates that the attempt to place a small electric pole failed because there are no small electric poles available in the inventory. Here's how you can address this issue and successfully connect your assembling machine to the power network:\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Error:\n\n1. **Check Inventory for Electric Poles**: Before attempting to place an electric pole, ensure that you have at least one in your inventory. You can check your inventory using the `inspect_inventory()` function.\n\n2. **Acquire Electric Poles**: If you don't have any electric poles, you need to craft or acquire them. You can craft small electric poles using wood and copper cables if you have the necessary materials.\n\n3. **Adjust Placement**: Once you have the poles, ensure that the placement position is valid and within reach of the assembling machine and any existing power network.\n\n### Example Code to Check and Place Electric Poles:\n\n```python\n# Check if small electric poles are available in inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nif Prototype.SmallElectricPole not in inventory or inventory[Prototype.SmallElectricPole] == 0:\n    print(\"No small electric poles available in inventory. Please craft or acquire some.\")\n\n# If poles are available, place one near the assembling machine\nelse:\n    # Adjust the position as needed to connect to the power network\n    power_pole_position = Position(x=4.0, y=0.0)\n    try:\n        power_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, power_pole_position)\n        print(\"Small electric pole placed successfully.\")\n        \n        # Connect the pole to the assembling machine\n        connect_entities(power_pole, new_furnace)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to place small electric pole: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n\n- **Crafting Electric Poles**: If you need to craft electric poles, ensure you have wood and copper cables. Use the crafting function to create them if necessary.\n  \n- **Valid Placement**: Ensure that the position where you are trying to place the pole is not obstructed by other entities or terrain features.\n\n- **Power Network**: Make sure that the pole is placed within the range of existing power sources or other poles to extend the network effectively.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully power your assembling machine.", "summary_range": "[1-98]"}
