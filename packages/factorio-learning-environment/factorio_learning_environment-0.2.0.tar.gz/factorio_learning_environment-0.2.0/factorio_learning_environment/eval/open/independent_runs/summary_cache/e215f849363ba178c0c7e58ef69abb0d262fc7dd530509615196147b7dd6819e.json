{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone brick production at position (-50.0, 0.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (-50.0, 0.0) facing RIGHT mining stone\n- Stone furnace at (-45.0, 0.0) smelting stone bricks\n- Burner inserter at (-47.5, 0.5) moving stone from belts to furnace\n- Transport belt at (-48.5, 0.5) carrying stone from drill to inserter\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter at (-49.5, 3.5) moving bricks to chest\n  - Wooden chest at (-49.5, 4.5) for brick storage\n\n#### New stone brick production line at position (20.0, 11.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 11.0) facing DOWN (now missing)\n- Stone furnace at (21.0, 13.0) for smelting\n- Burner inserter at (21.5, 11.5) moving items\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 12.5) moving items\n- Wooden chest at (22.5, 13.5) for output storage\n\nCurrent status:\n- Original line still non-functional due to input/output issues\n- New line has missing mining drill (previously at 20.0,11.0)\n- Furnace at (21.0,13.0) has no ingredients\n- Inserters showing \"waiting for source items\" status\n\n#### Additional structures at (18.5, -0.5)\n- Wooden chest at (18.5, -0.5) with coal\n- Burner inserter at (18.5, 0.5) waiting\n- Burner inserter at (18.5, 1.5) waiting\n- Wooden chest at (18.5, 2.5) empty\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent placement errors\n- Repeated failures placing inserters at (21.0,11.0), (21.5,13.0)\n- Chest placement failures at (20.5,13.5), (21.5,12.5)\n- Belt placement failure at (18.5,0.0)\n- Solutions:\n  - Always verify placement positions with can_place_entity()\n  - Check for existing entities before placement\n  - Maintain spatial awareness of existing structures\n\n#### Entity interaction failures\n- Attempting to get non-existent drill at (20.0,11.0)\n- Attempting to get non-existent furnace at (22.0,11.0)\n- Must:\n  - Verify entity existence before interaction\n  - Implement error handling for missing entities\n  - Maintain accurate entity position tracking\n\n#### Production chain issues\n- Both production lines non-functional due to:\n  - Missing mining drill\n  - Inserters waiting for source items\n  - Furnace with no ingredients\n- Required actions:\n  - Rebuild missing mining drill\n  - Verify complete material flow paths\n  - Check inserter directions and positions\n\n#### Entity status monitoring\n- Multiple inserters showing \"waiting for source items\"\n- Furnace showing \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Need to:\n  - Implement status monitoring system\n  - Create alerts for blocked production\n  - Automate problem detection\n\n#### Throughput issues\n- Current production: 0 bricks, inconsistent coal production\n- Bottlenecks:\n  - Broken production chains\n  - Missing key components\n  - Entity positioning problems\n- Improvement path:\n  - Complete at least one functional production line\n  - Implement proper monitoring\n  - Optimize entity spacing and orientations\n\n#### Repetitive error patterns\n- Same placement errors occurring multiple times\n- Need to:\n  - Implement placement validation routines\n  - Break retry loops with condition checks\n  - Develop spatial planning system"}
