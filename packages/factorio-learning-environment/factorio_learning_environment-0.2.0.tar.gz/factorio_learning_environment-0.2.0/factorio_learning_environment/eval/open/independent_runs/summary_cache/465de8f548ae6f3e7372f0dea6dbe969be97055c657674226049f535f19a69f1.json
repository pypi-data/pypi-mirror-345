{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various positions around the steam engine, such as (-39.5, -116.5), (-38.5, -115.5), (-38.5, -114.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Processing at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to move items from a Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) to another Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Lab with no power input.\n- Multiple PipeGroups in various positions, all currently empty.\n- Electricity Group with multiple poles, currently with 0 voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions in the path when connecting pipes between entities. Clear any existing obstructions before attempting to connect.\n\n### Attribute Errors with PipeGroup\n- Avoid accessing attributes that do not exist on objects. Verify the object type and its attributes before attempting to access them.\n\n### Errors due to Placement Blockage\n- Before placing or connecting entities, ensure that the target position is free of any blockages or existing entities that might prevent successful placement or connection."}
