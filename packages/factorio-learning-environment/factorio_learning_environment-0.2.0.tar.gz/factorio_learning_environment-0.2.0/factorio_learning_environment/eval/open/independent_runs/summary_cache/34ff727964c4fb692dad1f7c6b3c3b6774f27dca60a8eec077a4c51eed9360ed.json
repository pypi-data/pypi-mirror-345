{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), boiler (position not specified), and steam engine (position not specified). The offshore pump is responsible for extracting water, which is essential for the operation of the steam engine.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) that transfers items to and from the furnace.\n- Additional furnaces and chests (positions 3.5, 1.5; 10.0, 1.0; 3.5, 3.5; 3.5, 5.5) for storage and processing.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipes (positions not specified) connected to the offshore pump, allowing for the transportation of water to the steam engine and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that cannot be built upon (e.g., water). Check the coordinates before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Ensure that the steam engine is nearby and operational before attempting to insert coal. Verify that the steam engine is powered and ready to accept fuel.\n\n### NameError in code execution\n- Review the code to ensure that all necessary libraries and built-in functions are properly defined and imported. Check for any typos or missing definitions that could lead to a NameError.\n\n### Repeated issues with electricity groups\n- Regularly check the status of electricity groups and ensure that they are properly connected to power sources. If there are no electricity groups on the map, investigate the cause and rectify any issues with power distribution."}
