{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -86.0) and wooden chest (position 41.5, -84.5)\n- Burner mining drill (position 43.0, -86.0) and wooden chest (position 43.5, -84.5)\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -84.5) connecting the two chests\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -17.0, -52.0) and wooden chest (position -16.5, -50.5)\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -51.0) and stone furnace (position -13.0, -50.0)\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage at position (-11.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position -11.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inventory Management Issues\n- **Inventory Full**: The agent repeatedly failed to harvest coal due to a full inventory. Ensure to clear inventory space before attempting to harvest resources.\n- **Chest Full**: The agent failed to insert iron plates into a chest because it was full. Check the chest's capacity before attempting to insert items.\n\n#### Fuel Management Issues\n- **Out of Fuel**: Multiple burner mining drills and inserters are out of fuel. Ensure to refuel these entities to keep operations running smoothly.\n- **No Coal in Inventory**: The agent attempted to refuel entities but had no coal in its inventory. Always ensure you have sufficient fuel before attempting to refuel.\n\n#### Harvesting Issues\n- **Harvesting with Full Inventory**: The agent attempted to harvest coal with a full inventory. Always ensure there is space in the inventory before harvesting resources.\n\n#### Insertion Issues\n- **Failed to Insert Items**: The agent failed to insert items into chests due to full inventories or lack of items. Always check the destination inventory's capacity and ensure you have the items to insert.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **harvest_resource(position, quantity)**: Attempts to harvest a resource at the given position. Fails if the inventory is full.\n- **insert_item_into_chest(item, position, quantity)**: Attempts to insert items into a chest at the given position. Fails if the chest is full or if the item is not in the inventory.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **coal_patch_pos**: Position of the nearest coal patch.\n- **inventory**: Current inventory of the agent, including items like transport belts, burner inserters, wood, stone, iron ore, and iron plates."}
