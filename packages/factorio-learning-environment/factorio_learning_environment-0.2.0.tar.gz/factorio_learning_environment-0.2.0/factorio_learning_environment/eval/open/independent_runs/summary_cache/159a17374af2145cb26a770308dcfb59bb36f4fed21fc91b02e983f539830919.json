{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0), which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5), used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-13.5, -48.5), which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at Positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0), which smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (-6.5, -48.5), which stores the produced iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at Positions (-14.5, -47.5) and (-8.5, -47.5), which manage the transfer of materials between entities.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Incorrect Argument Type in Function Call\n- Ensure that the first argument in function calls like `inspect_inventory()` is an Entity or Position object, not an integer. This will prevent `ValueError` exceptions.\n\n#### Insufficient Inventory for Item Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, verify that the required items are available in your inventory. This will avoid exceptions related to insufficient items for insertion.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This will prevent the inserter from being in a waiting state.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination entity has enough space to accept items from the inserter. This will prevent the inserter from being blocked due to a full destination."}
