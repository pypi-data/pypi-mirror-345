{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, 1.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump (position(-9.5, 1.5)), boiler (position(-5.0, 4.5)), and steam engine (position(0.5, 8.5)) connected by pipes. The system is operational and generating power, with the boiler currently fueled with coal.\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at position(30.0, 86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position(30.0, 86.0)) with a wooden chest (position(30.5, 87.5)) to collect iron ore\n- Burner mining drill (position(36.0, 90.0)) with a wooden chest (position(36.5, 91.5)) to collect iron ore\nBoth mining drills are currently out of fuel and not operating.\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at position(43.0, 89.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position(43.0, 89.0)) for smelting iron ore into plates\n- Stone furnace (position(51.0, 92.0)) for smelting iron ore into plates\nBoth furnaces are currently out of fuel and not operating.\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Assembly at position(56.5, 94.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position(56.5, 94.5)) set to produce iron gear wheels\n- Input inserter (position(54.5, 94.5)) to feed materials into the assembler\n- Output inserter (position(58.5, 94.5)) to move finished products\n- Wooden chest (position(59.5, 94.5)) to collect the finished gear wheels\n- Small electric poles connecting the assembly area to the power network\nThe assembly machine is powered but has no recipe set, and the output inserter lacks power.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target location is already occupied by another entity\n- Use the entity's bounding box information to ensure there's enough space for placement\n- For mining drills, ensure the target area is suitable (not water or other unplaceable terrain)\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Ensure that all electrical devices are properly connected to the power network\n- Some entities like the output inserter at (58.5, 94.5) are not receiving power\n\n### Errors with fluid connections\n- When connecting entities with pipes, ensure that the connection points are properly aligned\n- The boiler and steam engine connection failed because the connection points may be blocked or misaligned\n\n### Inventory management errors\n- Keep track of your inventory contents before attempting to place or use items\n- The attempt to place a wooden chest failed due to no chests being in inventory\n- Similarly, attempting to add coal to entities failed when coal was depleted from inventory\n\n### Fuel management\n- Mining drills and furnaces need fuel to operate\n- Regularly check and refuel entities to maintain production\n- Both mining drills and furnaces are currently idle due to lack of fuel\n\nAI: # EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, 1.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump (position(-9.5, 1.5)), boiler (position(-5.0, 4.5)), and steam engine (position(0.5, 8.5)) connected by pipes.
