The updated inventory now shows:\n\n- 6 Wood\n- 10 Coal\n\n### Current Furnace and Chest Status Recap:\n1. **First Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 5 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 19 (remaining for processing)\n   - Status: WORKING (currently processing iron ore)\n\n2. **Second Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 7 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 0 (none remaining)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 75 (total)\n   - Status: NO INGREDIENTS (currently idle)\n\n3. **Wooden Chest:**\n   - Contains: 100 Iron Plates\n   - Status: NORMAL\n\n### Summary:\n- The first furnace is actively working on processing the iron ore, while the second furnace remains idle due to a lack of input materials.\n- The wooden chest continues to store the produced iron plates.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. We should monitor the first furnace as it processes the iron ore.\n2. Once it finishes, we can either extract the produced iron plates or insert more iron ore into the second furnace to keep operations running smoothly.\n\nLet\u2019s keep an eye on the first furnace and check back in a moment to see how much iron plate it produces!\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1.
