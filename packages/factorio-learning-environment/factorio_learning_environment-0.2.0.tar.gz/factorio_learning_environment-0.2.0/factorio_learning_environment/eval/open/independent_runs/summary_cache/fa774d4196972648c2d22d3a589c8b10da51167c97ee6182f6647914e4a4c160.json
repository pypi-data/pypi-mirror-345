{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map as all attempts to place entities have failed. The logs indicate that no entities have been successfully placed or configured on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before placing any entity. Many placement attempts failed because the target position was already occupied or unsuitable for the entity type.\n\n### Undefined Variable Errors\n- Correctly define all variables before using them in automation scripts. The error \"name 'new_chest' is not defined\" suggests that the variable was used without being declared.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters with incorrect spacing or direction\n- Verify that there is enough space and the correct direction is set before placing inserters. Placement failed due to collisions or incorrect spacing and direction.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure they are valid and within the playable area. Many placement attempts failed due to invalid or unsuitable coordinates.\n\n### Errors when powering inserters\n- Ensure that all necessary power connections are established and correctly named. The error \"name 'ore_inserter' is not defined\" suggests a misconfiguration or missing definition in the power setup."}
