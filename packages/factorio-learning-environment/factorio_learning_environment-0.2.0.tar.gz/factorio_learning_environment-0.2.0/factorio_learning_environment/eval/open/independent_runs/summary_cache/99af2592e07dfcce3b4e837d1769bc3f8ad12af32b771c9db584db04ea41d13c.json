{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) and an Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items from the Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) to another Iron Chest at position (44.5, -80.5).\n- Additional Iron Chests at positions (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) and a Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0).\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5) for storage of iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Chests\n- Ensure your inventory has enough space before attempting to extract items from chests to avoid extraction failures.\n\n### Errors when Supplying Iron Ore to Furnaces\n- Verify that you have sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply furnaces to prevent insertion failures.\n\n### Errors when Inventory is Full\n- Regularly manage and clear your inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can hinder harvesting and other operations.\n\n### Errors when Refueling or Supplying Furnaces\n- Confirm that you have the necessary resources (e.g., coal for refueling, iron ore for supplying) in your inventory before attempting these actions to avoid failures.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Chests\n- Make sure to empty the destination chests to continue mining operations effectively and prevent warnings related to full chests."}
