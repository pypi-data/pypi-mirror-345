{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5), and steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel, and the steam engine is not connected to a power network.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently working and has iron ore as a source.\n- The factory is connected to the electricity generator for power supply.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) which is currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups that facilitate fluid transport, including:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=21883, position=-6.5, 23.5) which is currently full of water.\n- Additional pipe groups at various positions that are empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to boiler and steam engine connection\n- Ensure the boiler has fuel and is connected to the steam engine to avoid the \"not connected to power network\" and \"no fuel\" warnings.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to furnace operation\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate to avoid \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings."}
