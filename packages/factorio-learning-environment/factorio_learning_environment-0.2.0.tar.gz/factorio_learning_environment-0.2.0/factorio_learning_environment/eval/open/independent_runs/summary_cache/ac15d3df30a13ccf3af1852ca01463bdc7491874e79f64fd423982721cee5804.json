{"content": "Here's the report based on the provided logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete)\nCurrently consists of:\n- Boiler at position (-6.0, 24.5) facing right\n- Offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\nThe system is not operational due to missing components and connections.\n\n### Production Area\n1. Basic Smelting Line\n- Four stone furnaces at positions:\n  - (0.0, 0.0) with 17 coal\n  - (2.0, 0.0) with 18 coal\n  - (5.0, 0.0) with no fuel\n  - (8.0, 0.0) with 8 coal\n- Burner inserter at (3.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden chest at (4.5, 1.5)\n\n2. Advanced Production Line\n- Two stone furnaces at:\n  - (4.0, 4.0) with 19 coal\n  - (6.0, 4.0) with 21 coal\n- Assembling machine at (11.5, 1.5) for automation science pack production\n- Multiple inserters and chests for item movement:\n  - Inserter at (9.5, 1.5)\n  - Chest at (8.5, 1.5) containing iron plates, copper plates, and iron gear wheels\n  - Inserter at (13.5, 1.5)\n  - Output chest at (14.5, 1.5) containing automation science pack\n\n### Research Facility\n- 10 labs connected to power network (currently unpowered)\n- Some labs contain automation science packs:\n  - Lab 1: 56 packs\n  - Lab 3: 110 packs\n  - Lab 4: 31 packs\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups forming a logistics network:\n- Belt group from (4.5, 2.5) to (2.5, 2.5)\n- Belt group from (6.5, 2.5) to (4.5, 2.5)\n- Long belt group from (7.5, 3.5) to (-4.5, 19.5)\n- Belt group from (1.5, 5.5) to (1.5, 11.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Setup Errors\n- Ensure proper spacing when placing boilers - they cannot overlap with water tiles\n- Verify fuel (coal/stone) is actually in inventory before attempting to insert into boiler\n- Complete the full power system setup (boiler + steam engine) before expecting operation\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones in a location\n- Ensure proper clearance and valid building positions when placing structures\n- Verify entity orientation matches the intended system design\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Confirm resources are in inventory before attempting insertion operations\n- When extracting resources, ensure you are within reach of the target entity\n- Verify coal mining operations actually add coal to inventory before proceeding\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Ensure all power system components are properly connected (offshore pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine)\n- Power network needs to be complete and operational before connected entities will function\n- Verify fluid connections are properly established between components"}
