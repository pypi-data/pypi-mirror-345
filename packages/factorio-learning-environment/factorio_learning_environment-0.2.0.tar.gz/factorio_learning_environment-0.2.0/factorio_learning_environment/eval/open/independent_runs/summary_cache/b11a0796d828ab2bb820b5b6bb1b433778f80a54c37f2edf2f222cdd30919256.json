Recent operations increased production for pipe crafting \u2013 multiple extraction and insertion events have boosted the output (current extractions have raised inventory levels to a high count, e.g. 92 iron plates recorded in recent steps).\n- Stone furnace at position(3.0, 1.0) that smelts copper ore into copper plates (fuel: 2 coal, produced 6 copper plates, awaiting further ingredients).\n\n### Research Lab at position(6.5, 6.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position(6.5, 6.5) performing \u201cautomation\u201d research with input {automation-science-pack: 10} and status NO_POWER.\n- ElectricityGroup connecting small electric poles at positions (9.5, 6.5), (10.5, 7.5), and (8.5, 6.5) with voltage 0.\n\n### Steam-Powered Electricity Generator at position(2.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position(2.5, 21.5) (status NOT_CONNECTED; warnings: [\u201cnot connected to power network\u201d, \u201cno input liquid\u201d, \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d]).\n- Boiler at position(-6.0, 24.5) (status NO_FUEL; warnings: [\u201cout of fuel\u201d]; its fluid box holds roughly 199.6 units of water at 15\u00b0C).\n- Offshore Pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) (status WORKING).\n- Pipeline Network comprising multiple reattempts:\n\u2003\u2022 A four-segment chain reattempt (Step 1312) defined with chain points p1 = (-6.0, 24.5), p2 = (-4.5, 23.5), p3 = (-2.5, 22.5), and p4 = (-0.5, 21.5). Fallback placements were used at each point but connection failures occurred:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 The source-to-p1 connection and the segment from p1 to p2 both failed.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Segments from p2 to p3 and p3 to p4 failed due to insufficient pipe inventory.\n\u2003\u2022 A subsequent direct connection attempt (Step 1316) between the boiler and the steam engine failed because none of the connection points were valid or unblocked.\n\u2003\u2022 An attempt to connect using specific connection points (boiler output at (-5.5, 22.5) and steam engine input at (0.0, 21.5)) in Step 1317 also failed.\n\u2003\u2022 Repositioning of the steam engine closer to the boiler (Steps 1318\u20131319) using adjusted spacing in Direction.RIGHT failed because target positions conflicted with existing pipe entities.\n- Manual Fuel Feeding System: Wooden chest at position(-4.5, 25.5) designated for fuel storage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n- Pipeline Connection and Construction:\n\u2003\u2022 Before joining segments, verify that both the source and target connection points are clear, buildable, and within the allowed placement range. When using fallback methods (e.g. nearest_buildable), ensure the positions still allow for valid connections.\n\u2003\u2022 For multi\u2010segment pipelines, double-check that all intermediate segments have clear line\u2010of\u2010sight and that no obstructions exist.\n\u2003\u2022 Maintain sufficient pipe inventory before initiating pipeline constructions; errors indicating \u201cinsufficient pipe\u201d (as observed in segments between p2 and p3 or p3 and p4) require gathering and crafting additional pipes.\n\n- Direct Connections and Fluid Transfer:\n\u2003\u2022 Confirm that the designated fluid connection points (such as those on the boiler and steam engine) are unobstructed and compatible. If direct connections fail, review the placement and environmental clearance.\n\u2003\u2022 When specific connection point attempts fail, consider both repositioning entities and rechecking for any built-up obstructions along the connection path.\n\n- Entity Placement and Collision Avoidance:\n\u2003\u2022 Prior to placing or repositioning entities (for example, when moving the steam engine near the boiler), verify that the target tile is free of conflicting entities such as existing pipe segments. Adjust spacing or direction if a collision is detected.\n\u2003\u2022 If placement fails (e.g. \u201ca pipe already exists at...\u201d errors), try increasing spacing or changing the reference position to resolve conflicts.\n\n- Resource and Crafting Management:\n\u2003\u2022 Ensure that all sub-ingredients needed for crafting (for instance, 7 iron plates per pipe) are available in the inventory before initiating the crafting process.\n\u2003\u2022 Monitor and adjust resource extraction and smelting operations to support production needs; proactive management can help prevent crafting failures due to resource shortfalls."}
