{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Expanded power network connecting the lab at position (5.5, 5.5) to the power source at position (10.5, 34.5).\n- Consists of multiple electric poles at positions such as (7.5, 17.5), (7.5, 13.5), (7.5, 9.5), (13.5, 27.5), (16.5, 31.5), (12.5, 34.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing\n- **Coal Mining Site at position (40.0, -84.0)**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (40.5, -82.5).\n  - Additional wooden chest at position (41.5, -83.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production\n- **Iron Plate Production Facility**\n  - Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) transferring items to a wooden chest at position (56.5, -83.5).\n  - Iron chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n\n### Steam Power Generation (Incomplete)\n- **Steam Power Setup**\n  - Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5) connected to a pipe network.\n  - Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0) with no fuel.\n  - Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5) not connected due to missing pipe connections.\n\n### Belt System\n- **Belt System**\n  - BeltGroup transporting coal with belts positioned at (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5), and (49.5, -86.5) to (47.5, -86.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes are available in the inventory before attempting to connect them.\n- Verify that the pipe network between the boiler and the steam engine is complete and correctly aligned.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to maintain operational status.\n- Ensure that all mining drills and inserters have sufficient fuel to continue operations.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of pipes in the inventory to facilitate connections between entities.\n- Regularly clear full chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to storage constraints."}
