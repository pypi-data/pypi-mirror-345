{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5).\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Connected to electricity but currently has no power due to missing connections.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Furnace at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0) that is currently full output with coal as fuel.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position -17.5, 23.5) that is currently not researching due to no research in progress.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups that connect various entities for fluid transport.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure all machines are properly connected to a power source. The assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) is currently not receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to missing resources\n- Check the ingredients required for crafting in the assembling machine. The assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) is unable to create automation-science-pack due to missing resources: copper-plate and iron-gear-wheel."}
