{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(x=-40.5, y=40.5)\nConsists of a steam engine at position(x=-40.5, y=40.5) which is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Boiler system at position(x=-24.5, y=32.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position(x=-24.5, y=32.0) with multiple offshore pumps connected to it, including offshore pumps at positions(x=-16.5, y=26.5), (x=-18.5, y=27.5), (x=-13.5, y=26.5), (x=-3.5, y=27.5), (x=-1.5, y=28.5), and (x=1.5, y=32.5).\n\n### Pipe network at fluid system 367396\nConsists of multiple pipes connecting various entities, including offshore pumps and boilers, across the map.\n\n### Pipe network at fluid system 367501\nConsists of multiple pipes connecting offshore pumps at positions(x=-16.5, y=26.5) and (x=-18.5, y=27.5).\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of multiple small electric poles, including poles at positions(x=-14.5, y=7.5), (x=4.5, y=6.5), (x=9.5, y=9.5), (x=-12.5, y=1.5), (x=3.5, y=0.5), and (x=-14.5, y=15.5), forming an electricity group with id 57899.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the entities are close enough to be connected.\n- Check that the connection points of the entities are not occupied by other entities.\n- Verify that the entities are compatible for connection (e.g., pipe to boiler, offshore pump to boiler).\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the tile where the entity is being placed is not occupied by another entity.\n- Check that the entity can be placed at the specified position (e.g., offshore pump near water).\n\n### Errors when using API functions\n- Verify that the API function is being used correctly (e.g., connect_entities, place_entity).\n- Check that the parameters passed to the API function are valid (e.g., entity names, positions)."}
