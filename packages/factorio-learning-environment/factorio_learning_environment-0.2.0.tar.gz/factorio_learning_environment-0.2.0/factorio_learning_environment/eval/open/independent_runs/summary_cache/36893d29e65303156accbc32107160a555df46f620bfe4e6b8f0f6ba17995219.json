{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. Misalignment causes the inserter to fail in transferring items. Check and adjust the inserter's position and direction to ensure proper alignment.\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- When placing an inserter, verify that there is no collision with existing entities and that the area is suitable for placement. If placement fails, consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Running out of fuel will prevent entities from operating.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to transfer iron ore into the furnace. If the furnace is not receiving materials, check the inserter's alignment and ensure it is operational."}
