{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Smelting Station at (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace that smelts iron ore into iron plates. The furnace is fueled by coal and processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n###Copper Plate Smelting Station at (-26.0, -61.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace that smelts copper ore into copper plates. The furnace is fueled by coal and processes copper ore into copper plates.\n\n###Research Station at (-2.5, -49.5)\nConsists of a lab that processes automation science packs for research. Currently conducting automation research.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Errors with recipe requirements and crafting\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items\n- Some items like plates cannot be crafted directly and require smelting in a furnace\n\n###Errors with entity extraction\n- Cannot extract items from furnaces that haven't completed smelting\n- Verify the target furnace contains the desired output item before attempting extraction\n\n###Errors with entity placement\n- When working with coordinates from BoundingBox objects, access them using the correct attribute methods instead of treating them as subscriptable\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place entities (e.g., offshore pump placement failure)\n\n###Errors with furnace operations\n- Wait for smelting operations to complete before attempting to extract products\n- Monitor furnace status to ensure it has ingredients and fuel before expecting output"}
