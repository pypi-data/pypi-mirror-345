{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) containing iron ore and copper ore.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) fueled and working, connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a warning of being out of fuel.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest and furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) fueled and working, dropping coal into a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) containing coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is clear of other entities before attempting to place. Remove any obstructing entities first to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Errors with resource supply to furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of ingredients to process, preventing warnings of no ingredients to smelt. Consider setting up automated supply lines using inserters and transport belts."}
