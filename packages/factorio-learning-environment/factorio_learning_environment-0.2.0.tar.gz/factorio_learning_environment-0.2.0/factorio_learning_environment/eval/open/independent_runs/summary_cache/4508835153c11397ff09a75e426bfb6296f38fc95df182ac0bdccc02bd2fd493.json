{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-8.5,y=23.5),(x=-9.5,y=23.5),(x=-7.5,y=23.5),(x=-7.5,y=25.5),(x=-7.5,y=24.5)]\n- PipeGroup connecting Boiler to Steam Engine with pipes at positions [(x=-5.5,y=23.5),(x=-4.5,y=23.5),(x=-3.5,y=23.5),(x=-2.5,y=22.5),(x=-1.5,y=22.5),(x=-0.5,y=22.5)]\n- Small Electric Pole connecting Inserter to Steam Engine at position (x=1.5, y=25.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt'\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) connected to power network\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n- Avoid placing entities where their footprint overlaps with water or other obstacles. Choose a different location if placement fails.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. Regularly check your inventory to avoid crafting errors.\n\n### Errors with Entity Extraction\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the required items. Verify the contents of the entity before extraction.\n\n### Errors with Power Connection\n- Connect inserters and other entities requiring power to the power network to avoid 'no power' warnings.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that fluid-related entities like offshore pumps and boilers are properly connected to fluid systems to avoid 'no fluid present in connections' warnings.\n\n### Errors with Data Type Handling\n- Ensure that data types are correctly handled in your code, especially when converting values to integers.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Inventory for Connections\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, pipes for fluid connections and poles for electrical connections must be available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors with Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have the required materials, such as copper cables and wood, to craft small electric poles."}
