{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities to transport water and steam\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) with Inserter at Position (2.5, 1.5) feeding into the furnace\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (19.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) with Inserter at Position (3.5, 0.5) feeding into the furnace\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) with Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) feeding into the machine\n- Belt Group connecting the stone furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Pipe Group at Position (20.5, -10.5) for steam transport\n- Pipe Group at Position (5.5, -8.5) for water transport\n- Pipe Group at Position (18.5, -3.5) for water transport\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with multiple Small Electric Poles providing power to various entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have sufficient items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal without having any in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors Related to Missing Ingredients\n- Regularly check the status of your furnaces and assembling machines to ensure they have the necessary ingredients to function. For instance, ensure stone furnaces have ore to smelt and assembling machines have the required copper plates to produce copper cables.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. If inserters are waiting for source items, check the connected entities and ensure they are producing or have the necessary items."}
