{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) fueled with coal, connected to pipes and steam engine.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) generating electricity, connected to small electric poles.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n- Pipe Network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, facilitating the flow of water and steam.\n\n### Copper Plate Smelting Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) fueled with coal, smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Research Lab at Position (not specified)\nConsists of:\n- Lab actively conducting research on logistics using automation science packs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available and that copper plates are smelted in a furnace before attempting to craft copper cables and subsequently small electric poles.\n\n### Assertion Error Due to Lack of Small Electric Poles\n- Maintain an adequate inventory of small electric poles to avoid connection issues. Ensure that crafting prerequisites are met to produce them when needed."}
