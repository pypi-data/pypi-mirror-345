Misalignment can lead to items not being transferred correctly.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in all fuel-dependent entities such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of coal or other fuel to keep operations running smoothly.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests and other storage entities to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. Ensure that there is a system in place to manage and clear excess resources.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Verify that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Ensure that the supply chain from resource extraction to processing is uninterrupted and efficient."}
