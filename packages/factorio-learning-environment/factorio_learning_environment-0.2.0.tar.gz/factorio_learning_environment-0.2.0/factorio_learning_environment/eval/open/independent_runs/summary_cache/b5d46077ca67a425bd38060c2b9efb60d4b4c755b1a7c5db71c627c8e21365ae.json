{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest**: Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placing a Wooden Chest. Check for any obstructions or incorrect positioning.\n- **Cannot place Stone Furnace**: Verify that the placement area for the Stone Furnace is clear and that the tile is appropriate for the entity.\n- **Cannot place ore inserter and plate inserter**: Make sure the inserter's target position is valid and not obstructed by other entities.\n- **Cannot place output chest**: Confirm that the output chest's intended location is available and not blocked by other structures.\n\n### Errors related to movement\n- **Error moving to Wooden Chest area**: Ensure that the position object is correctly defined and callable. Avoid using strings where integers are expected for indices.\n- **Error moving to Stone Furnace area**: Similar to the Wooden Chest area, confirm that the position object is correctly utilized and that the indices are integers.\n\n### General Tips\n- **BuildingBox size issue**: When using a BuildingBox, ensure that its size is appropriate for the available space. Consider using smaller BuildingBoxes or adjusting the size to fit the map's constraints.\n- **String indices must be integers**: When dealing with positions or indices, ensure that you are using integers instead of strings to avoid type-related errors."}
