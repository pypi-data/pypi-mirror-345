{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Transport Belt network connecting the Burner Mining Drill to the Wooden Chest\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) moving items from the Wooden Chest to another Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) moving items between chests\n\n### Belt Network\nMultiple Belt Groups connecting various entities:\n- Belt Group at positions (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5) and (-21.5, -67.5) to (-21.5, -69.5)\n- Belt Group at positions (-18.5, -71.5) to (-16.5, -71.5)\n- Belt Group at positions (-26.5, -69.5) to (-24.5, -69.5)\n- Additional Belt Groups connecting various positions as part of the transport network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with BeltGroup Attributes\n- Ensure that the `BeltGroup` object has the correct attributes before attempting to access them. The `output_position` attribute was missing, leading to an `AttributeError`. Verify the structure and properties of custom objects before use.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. Attempting to place a transport belt on an occupied tile can lead to obstructions and errors.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Connections\n- Confirm that transport belts are correctly connected. Use assertions or checks to ensure belts are properly linked to their intended endpoints to avoid connectivity issues."}
