{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest (41.5, -80.5) for coal storage\n- Burner inserter (41.5, -79.5) moving items from mining drill to chest\n\n### Iron Production Line at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-18.0, -53.0) for iron ore\n- Wooden chest (-17.5, -51.5) for temporary iron ore storage\n- Burner inserter (-16.5, -51.5) moving ore from chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace (-15.0, -51.0) smelting iron ore\n- Burner inserter (-13.5, -50.5) moving plates to storage\n- Wooden chest (-12.5, -50.5) for iron plate storage\n\nNote: All belt networks have been cleaned up and removed from the map.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place structures\n- When setting up new production lines, craft necessary buildings first (burner mining drills, etc.)\n\n### Production Chain Dependencies\n- When setting up automation science pack production, ensure all prerequisites are met:\n  - Need copper plate production line\n  - Need iron gear wheel production capability\n  - Need assembling machines for automated crafting\n\n### Recipe Requirements\n- Some items cannot be hand-crafted and require specific buildings:\n  - Copper plates require smelting in furnaces\n  - Automation science packs require assembling machines\n- Check recipe requirements before attempting to craft items\n\n### Storage Management\n- Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow conditions\n- Empty storage chests regularly when \"chest is full\" warnings appear\n- Implement overflow protection mechanisms for critical storage points\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep all burner devices (mining drills, inserters) adequately fueled\n- Monitor fuel levels regularly to maintain continuous operation\n- Ensure coal production and distribution keeps up with fuel consumption\n\n### Entity Placement\n- Verify target location is clear before placing new entities\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to allow for inserter operation\n- Consider future expansion when placing initial structures"}
