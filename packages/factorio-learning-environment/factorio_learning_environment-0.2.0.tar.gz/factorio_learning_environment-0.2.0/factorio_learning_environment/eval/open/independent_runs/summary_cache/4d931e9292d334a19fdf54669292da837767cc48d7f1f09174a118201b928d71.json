{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the steam engine, including various pipe segments and pipe-to-ground entities at positions such as (-9.5, 23.5), (5.5, 24.5), and others\n- Small Electric Pole at position (3.5, 20.5) for power distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) to transfer items between chests and furnaces\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storage\n\n### Research Lab Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (not specified) connected to power source\n- Inventory of automation science packs within the lab\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. For example, ensure no existing pipe is at (-1.5, 24.5) or (5.5, 24.5) before placing a new one.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move closer to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. For instance, the player was too far when trying to place a pipe at (-9.5, 23.5).\n\n### Errors in initiating research\n- Ensure that all prerequisites for the research are met and that the lab has the necessary science packs.\n\n### Errors due to undefined or missing entities\n- Verify that all entities are correctly defined and present at the specified positions before attempting to interact with them, such as the boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0).\n\n### Errors in verifying research prerequisites\n- Ensure that the correct API or method is used for checking research prerequisites, and that all necessary modules are imported and defined."}
