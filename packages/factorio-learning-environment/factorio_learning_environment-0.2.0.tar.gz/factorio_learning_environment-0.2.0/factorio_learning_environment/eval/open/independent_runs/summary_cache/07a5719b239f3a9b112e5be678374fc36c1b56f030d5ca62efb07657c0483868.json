{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-8, -59)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row mining iron ore:\n- First drill at (-10, -59) dropping to wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Second drill at (-8, -59) dropping to wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)  \n- Third drill at (-6, -59) dropping to wooden chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are working and have coal fuel. Chests contain varying amounts of iron ore.\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (3, 0)\nConsists of four smelting units in a row:\n- First unit: Furnace at (0, 0) with burner inserter at (0.5, -1.5) fed from chest at (0.5, -2.5)\n- Second unit: Furnace at (2, 0) with burner inserter at (2.5, -1.5) fed from chest at (2.5, -2.5)\n- Third unit: Furnace at (4, 0) with burner inserter at (4.5, -1.5) fed from chest at (4.5, -2.5)\n- Fourth unit: Furnace at (6, 0) with burner inserter at (6.5, -1.5) fed from chest at (6.5, -2.5)\n\nAll furnaces have coal fuel and output iron plates. Additional inserters and chests are placed to handle the output:\n- Output inserter at (0.5, 1.5) moving plates to chest at (0.5, 2.5)\n- Output inserter at (7.5, 0.5) moving plates to chest at (6.5, 1.5)\n- Additional output chests at (2.5, 1.5) and (4.5, 1.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Check inventory contains required items before attempting to place entities\n- Craft required items first if not available in inventory\n\n### Warning about full chests blocking mining\n- Regularly empty output chests to prevent mining operations from stalling\n- Consider setting up automation to move items from full chests to prevent blockages"}
