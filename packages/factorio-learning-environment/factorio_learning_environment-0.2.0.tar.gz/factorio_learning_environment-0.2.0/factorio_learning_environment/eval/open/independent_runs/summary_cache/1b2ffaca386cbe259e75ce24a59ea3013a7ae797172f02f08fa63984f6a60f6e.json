{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting offshore pump to steam engine, starting at position (-46.5, -122.5) and extending to various positions including (-36.5, -123.5)\n- Electricity Group with small electric poles connecting various positions including (-13.5, -92.5) to (31.5, -19.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Storage and Research Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates\n- Lab with no power, requiring automation science packs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Boilers\n- Ensure that the position selected for placing a boiler is suitable and not obstructed by other entities or terrain. Consider manually adjusting the position if automatic placement fails.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all electric entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a power source. Check the connections and ensure that the electricity network is complete and functioning.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- Regularly check and empty the output chest of mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Input\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply them with raw materials to maintain production efficiency."}
