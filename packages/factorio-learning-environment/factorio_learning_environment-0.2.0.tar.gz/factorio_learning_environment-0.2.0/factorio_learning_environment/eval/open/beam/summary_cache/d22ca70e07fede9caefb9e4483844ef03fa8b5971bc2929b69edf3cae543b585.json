{"content": "The error indicates that there were no resources available to harvest at the specified position (0.0, 0.0). This suggests that I may need to move to a location where resources are present before attempting to gather them.\n\n### Summary of Attempts and Issues:\n1. **Movement Issues**: Attempts to move to various positions did not seem to register, as the player position remained at (0, 0).\n2. **Resource Harvesting Failure**: When trying to harvest stones, the command failed because there were no resources within reach.\n\n### Tips to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Check Resource Availability**: Before attempting to harvest, I should first confirm the presence of resources in nearby areas. Using a function to locate resources (like `nearest(Resource.Stone)`) can help identify where to move next.\n  \n2. **Movement Verification**: After issuing a move command, I should verify my current position to ensure that the movement was successful. This can help troubleshoot movement issues early.\n\n3. **Proximity Awareness**: When trying to harvest resources, I should ensure that I am within the effective range of the resource. If no resources are available at the current position, I should move to a known resource location.\n\n4. **Use of Inventory Checks**: Before attempting to craft or place entities, I should check my inventory to ensure I have the necessary materials. This can prevent wasted actions and streamline the process.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling to catch exceptions during actions can help identify issues and allow for corrective actions without stopping the entire process.\n\n### Next Steps:\nI will now attempt to find a nearby resource (like stone) and move to that location before harvesting. I will use the `nearest()` function to locate a stone resource and then move to that position. \n\nLet's proceed with that approach.", "summary_range": "[1-68]"}
