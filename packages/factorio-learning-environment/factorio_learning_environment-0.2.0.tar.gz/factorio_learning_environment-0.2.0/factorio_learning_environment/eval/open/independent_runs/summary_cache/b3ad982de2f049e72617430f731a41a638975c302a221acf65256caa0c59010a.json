{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5) - working\n- Boiler at position(-5.0, 2.5) - now has coal but shows \"out of fuel\" warning\n- Steam engine at position(0.5, 6.5) - working\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole at position(0.5, 8.5) connected to the steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position(19.5, 71.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 at position(16.5, 71.5) - waiting for space in destination\n- Electric mining drill 2 at position(19.5, 71.5) - working\n- Electric mining drill 3 at position(22.5, 71.5) - working\n- Small electric poles at positions(14.5, 70.5) and (24.5, 73.5) providing power\n- Wooden chest at position(19.5, 73.5) collecting ore from drill 2 (currently full)\n- Wooden chest at position(22.5, 73.5) collecting ore from drill 3\n- Inserter at position(22.5, 74.5) to move ore from chest to belt (waiting for space)\n- Multiple belt groups connecting the mining area to the furnaces\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area at Position(25.5, 84.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric furnace 1 at position(22.5, 84.5) - no ingredients\n- Electric furnace 2 at position(25.5, 84.5) - no ingredients\n- Electric furnace 3 at position(28.5, 84.5) - no ingredients\n- Connected to the electricity network\n\n### Steel Plate Production Area at Position(29.5, 95.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric furnace 1 at position(26.5, 95.5) - not connected to power\n- Electric furnace 2 at position(29.5, 95.5) - not connected to power\n- Electric furnace 3 at position(32.5, 95.5) - not connected to power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with belts\n- When using `connect_entities()`, ensure there is a valid path between the start and end positions\n- The error \"Not a valid path to normalise\" indicates the path is too complex or impossible to create\n- Try creating shorter, simpler belt paths or use underground belts for longer distances\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing an entity\n- Use `get_entities()` to check for existing entities at a location before placing new ones\n- Clear existing entities with `pickup()` before attempting to place new ones at the same position\n\n### Errors with transport belt validation\n- Multiple validation errors for TransportBelt indicate incorrect parameter formatting\n- Ensure all required fields (name, direction, position, etc.) are properly specified when creating belts\n- When placing belts programmatically, use the correct API parameters\n\n### Mining efficiency issues\n- \"Transport belt at drop position is blocked\" indicates that the output belt from mining drill is full or blocked\n- \"Chest at drop position is full\" indicates the chest needs to be emptied\n- Use inserters to move items from chests to belts to keep the production flowing\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Ensure all electrical entities are connected to the power network\n- The steel furnaces show \"not connected to power network\" - extend the electric pole network to reach them\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
