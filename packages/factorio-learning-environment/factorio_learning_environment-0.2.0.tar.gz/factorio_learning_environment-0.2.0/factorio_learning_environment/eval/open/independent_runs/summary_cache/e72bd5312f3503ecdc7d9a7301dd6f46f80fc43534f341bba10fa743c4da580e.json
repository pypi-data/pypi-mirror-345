You need to add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.SteamEngine and use the inserter as the target entity.\u201d\n  \u2013 Tip: Always verify that the final target entity for belt connections is a valid inserter (or similar input device) rather than a steam engine or generator.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Issue\n  \u2013 An error occurred when attempting to place a wooden chest at (3.5,15.5) because the player was too far (distance 15.89 versus a max of 10).\n  \u2013 Tip: Ensure you move closer to the intended placement position so that it falls within the allowed maximum distance.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage\n  \u2013 The agent encountered \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d when trying to place a chest.\n  \u2013 Tip: Confirm that the required item is present in the inventory before initiating a placement action.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Error\n  \u2013 A NameError (\u201cname 'target_chest' is not defined\u201d) was raised due to referencing an undefined variable.\n  \u2013 Tip: Double-check variable names and ensure all referenced variables are properly defined and in scope before use."}
