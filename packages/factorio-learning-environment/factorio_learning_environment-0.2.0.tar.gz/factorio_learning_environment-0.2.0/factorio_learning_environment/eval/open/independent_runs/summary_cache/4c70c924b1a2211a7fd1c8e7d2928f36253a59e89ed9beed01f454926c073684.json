{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (5 units)\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, Stone Furnace\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Operations\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory to refuel all necessary entities such as mining drills and inserters. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies.\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Setup Issues\n- Verify the alignment and setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Reposition and align inserters as needed to maintain a smooth workflow.\n\n### Chest Management and Space Utilization\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent them from becoming full. Extract items from chests regularly to free up space and avoid halting operations.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting. Check the inserter setup and reposition if the furnace is not receiving iron ore or other required materials."}
