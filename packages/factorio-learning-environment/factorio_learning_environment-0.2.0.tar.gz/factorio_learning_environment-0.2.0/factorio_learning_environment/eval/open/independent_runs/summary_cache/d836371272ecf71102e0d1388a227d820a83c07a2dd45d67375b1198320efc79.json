{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0) which is currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (63.5, -52.5) intended to feed the furnace but is waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Collection System at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) actively mining iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-16.5, -51.5) transferring mined ore to a wooden chest.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5) transferring items between chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) for intermediate storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -51.5) collecting iron ore from the inserters.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where obstructions exist\n- Ensure the target location is clear of obstructions before attempting to place an entity. Repeated failures occurred when trying to place a burner inserter at (61.0, -53.0).\n\n### Errors when placing entities without inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place them. An error occurred when trying to place a wooden chest without having one in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in production\n- Regularly check and ensure that production entities like furnaces have the necessary ingredients to function. The furnace at (62.0, -53.0) is not producing due to a lack of iron ore.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters are actively producing or providing items. Multiple inserters are waiting for source items, indicating a potential bottleneck or misconfiguration in the supply chain."}
