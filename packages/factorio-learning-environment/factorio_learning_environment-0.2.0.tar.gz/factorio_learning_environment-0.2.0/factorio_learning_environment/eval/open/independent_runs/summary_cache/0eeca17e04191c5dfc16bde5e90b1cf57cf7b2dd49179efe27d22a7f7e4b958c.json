{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5). This drill is responsible for mining iron ore.\n- **Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with a source of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with a source of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) with a source of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- **Storage Chests** for storing mined and smelted materials:\n  - Iron chests at positions (x=-16.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-13.5, y=-49.5).\n  - Wooden chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-12.5, y=-49.5), and (x=-9.5, y=-49.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=41.5, y=-80.5). This drill is responsible for mining coal.\n- **Storage Chests** for storing mined coal:\n  - Iron chests at positions (x=41.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), (x=44.5, y=-80.5), (x=45.5, y=-80.5), (x=47.5, y=-80.5), and (x=49.5, y=-80.5).\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n\n### Coal Supply and Iron Plate Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserters** for transferring coal and iron plates:\n  - Inserter at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) transferring between chests and furnaces.\n  - Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-78.5) waiting for source items.\n- **Furnace** at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from storage\n- Ensure that the storage is not empty before attempting to extract items from it. Check the inventory of the storage entity to confirm availability.\n\n### Errors when clearing drop chests\n- Make sure the drop chests are not full before attempting to clear them. Regularly transfer items from drop chests to prevent overflow and ensure continuous operation of mining drills.\n\n### Errors when mining with full drop chests\n- Regularly empty the drop chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests. Implement a system to automatically transfer items from drop chests to storage chests or processing facilities."}
