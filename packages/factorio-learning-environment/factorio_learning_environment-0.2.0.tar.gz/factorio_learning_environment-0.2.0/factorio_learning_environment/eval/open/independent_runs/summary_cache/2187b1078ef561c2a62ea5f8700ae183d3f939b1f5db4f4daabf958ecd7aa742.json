Verify that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors in Power Generation\n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that the boiler is receiving input liquid. Check the fuel supply in the boiler to ensure it is sufficient for operation.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connection\n- Make sure that the steam engine is connected to the power network with small electric poles. Verify that all necessary connections are established to allow electricity flow.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure that the inserter is connected to a powered electric pole. Check the electricity network to confirm that power is being delivered to the inserter.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check for warnings and status messages on entities to identify and resolve issues promptly.\n- Maintain a consistent check on inventory levels and ensure that necessary resources are available for continuous operation."}
