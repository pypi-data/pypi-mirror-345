{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently has 20 units of coal as fuel.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -49.5): Transfers items into the furnace. Pickup position is at (-13.5, -49.5) and drop position is at (-11.5, -49.5). Currently out of fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -49.5): Acts as a storage unit for items transferred by the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. This error occurred when trying to insert iron ore and coal into entities without having sufficient quantities in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when Inserter is Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to maintain their operation. The burner inserter at position (-12.5, -49.5) frequently ran out of fuel, halting the transfer of items.\n\n### Errors due to Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. The furnace at (-15.0, -50.0) had warnings of 'no ingredients to smelt', indicating a lack of iron ore or other smeltable materials."}
