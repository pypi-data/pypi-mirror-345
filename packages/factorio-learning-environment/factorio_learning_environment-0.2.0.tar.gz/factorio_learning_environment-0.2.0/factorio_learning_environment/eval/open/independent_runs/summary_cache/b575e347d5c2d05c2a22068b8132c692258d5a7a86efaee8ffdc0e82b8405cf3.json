{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) facing DOWN\n- Output chest at (15.5, 72.5)\n- Connected to small electric pole at (17.5, 69.5)\n- Currently not powered (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (-46.5, 70.5) facing DOWN\n- Output chest at (-46.5, 72.5)\n- Connected to small electric pole at (-44.5, 69.5)\n- Currently not powered (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) with water output\n- Water pipe network extending to (27.5, 66.5)\n- Boiler at (19.0, 69.5) facing RIGHT with:\n  - Water input at (18.5, 67.5) and (18.5, 71.5)\n  - Steam output at (20.5, 69.5)\n  - Currently burning coal (45 units)\n- Steam engine at (23.5, 69.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Currently not connected to boiler (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Cannot place entities on occupied tiles - always check position is clear before placing\n- Cannot place entities too far from player - move within 10 tiles before placing\n\n### Power System Errors\n- Mining drills show \"not receiving electricity\" - ensure power poles connect to generators\n- Steam engine shows \"not connected to power network\" - connect with power poles\n- Steam engine shows \"no input liquid\" - properly connect boiler output to engine input\n\n### Fluid System Errors\n- Failed to connect boiler to steam engine - ensure pipe connections align with connection points\n- Boiler shows \"no input liquid\" - properly connect water source to boiler input\n- Cannot access boiler fluid box directly - use proper fluid system inspection methods\n\n### General Tips\n- Verify entity connections before asserting operational status\n- Check entity status and warnings before making assumptions\n- Plan pipe routes carefully to avoid blocked paths\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to allow connections"}
