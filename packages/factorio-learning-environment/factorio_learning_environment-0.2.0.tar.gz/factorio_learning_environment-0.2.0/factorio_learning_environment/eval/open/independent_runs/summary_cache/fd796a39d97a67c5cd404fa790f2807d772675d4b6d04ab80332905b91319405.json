{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) producing iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=13.0, y=0.0) producing iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) producing iron plates\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5) for moving items into furnaces\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (unknown) with automation science packs, currently working on logistics research\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5) with status EntityStatus.EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with fluid 'water' and status EntityStatus.WORKING\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=22.5) with fluid 'steam' and status EntityStatus.WORKING\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=25.5) with status EntityStatus.EMPTY\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, connecting the steam engine to the power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and placed without obstructions before attempting to connect them between offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines.\n\n### Errors Due to Placement Blockage\n- Clear any obstructions in the path of the pipes to ensure successful connections between entities. Make sure the path is clear before placing pipes.\n\n### Errors in Generating Power\n- Verify that all components in the power generation setup (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are correctly connected and operational. Double-check the connections and ensure there are no leaks or blockages in the pipe network.\n\n### Repeated Connection Failures\n- Review the layout and alignment of the pipe network to prevent repeated connection failures. Adjust the placement of pipes and entities to ensure a seamless connection."}
