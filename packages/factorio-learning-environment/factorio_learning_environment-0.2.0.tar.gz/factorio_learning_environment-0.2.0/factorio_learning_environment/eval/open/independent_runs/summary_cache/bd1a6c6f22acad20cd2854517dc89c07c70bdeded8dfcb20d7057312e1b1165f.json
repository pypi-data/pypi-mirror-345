{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items, intended to move items from the chest to another location.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution Facility at position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest to another location.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) receiving coal from the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items, intended to move items from the chest to another location.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) have items available for the inserters to pick up. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n- Verify that the inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to pick up items from the intended source.\n\n### Warnings of Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping due to lack of storage space.\n- Implement a more efficient logistics system to automatically manage inventory levels and prevent overflow.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'. Current values are {'wooden-chest': 3, 'wood': 10, 'coal': 765, 'iron-ore': 839, 'iron-plate': 965}."}
