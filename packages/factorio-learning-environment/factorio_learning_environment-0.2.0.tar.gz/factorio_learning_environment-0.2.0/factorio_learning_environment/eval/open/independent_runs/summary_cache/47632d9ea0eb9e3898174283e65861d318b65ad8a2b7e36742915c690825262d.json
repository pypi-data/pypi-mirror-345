{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5) connected to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing mined coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal transferred by the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items to transfer from the chest at (52.5, -77.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5) connected to a wooden chest and a stone furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently holding iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items to transfer from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items to transfer from the chest at (-13.5, -45.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or belts) have items available for inserters to transfer. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of storage space.\n\n### Furnace Without Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain to ensure raw materials are being delivered to the furnace.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Current inventory of the player, including wooden chests, wood, coal, iron ore, and iron plates."}
