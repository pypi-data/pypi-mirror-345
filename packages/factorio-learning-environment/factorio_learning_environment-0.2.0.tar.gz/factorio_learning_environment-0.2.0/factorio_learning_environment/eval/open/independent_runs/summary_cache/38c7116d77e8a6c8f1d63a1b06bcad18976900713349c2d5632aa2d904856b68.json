{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(1.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5) which is currently not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal) and no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal) and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) containing copper plates.\n\n### Laboratory at position(5.5, 4.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (5.5, 4.5) with lab input containing automation science packs and currently no power.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric poles\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed in a manner that allows them to connect to the electric network. Check the surrounding poles and their connections.\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items\n- Ensure you have enough items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the lab. Check your inventory count before insertion attempts.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect parameters for placing entities\n- When placing entities, ensure that the parameters passed are correct. For example, the direction must be a valid Direction object.\n\n### Errors when entities are not powered\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the electric network. Check the status of connected poles and adjust their positions if necessary."}
