{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 2.5)\n\n### Lab at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 3.5, 0.5) which requires 10 automation science packs to complete research but is currently not powered.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0, 0) with coal as fuel and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace (position 2, 0) with coal as fuel but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new poles\n- Ensure that the first argument for placing a pole is a valid Prototype object. Verify the object type before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when the lab is not powered\n- Check the power supply to the lab. Ensure that it is connected to a power source to enable its operation.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients for research\n- Ensure you have the required ingredients (in this case, 10 automation science packs) in your inventory before attempting to start research. \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
