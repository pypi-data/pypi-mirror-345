{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator near position (x=0.0, y=12.0)\n\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. Water is pumped from the lake by an offshore pump, heated into steam by two boilers, and then piped to four steam engines arranged in two columns. The steam engines are interconnected with pipes and connected to a central small electric pole, forming a functional power network. The boilers require manual coal insertion.\n\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water. Connected via pipes to the boilers.\n*   **Boiler 1** at position (x=0.0, y=10.5): Heats water using coal. Steam output piped to Steam Engine 1.\n*   **Boiler 2** at position (x=0.0, y=13.5): Heats water using coal. Steam output piped to Steam Engine 2.\n*   **Steam Engine 1**"}
