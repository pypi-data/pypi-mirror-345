Returns a list of connected entities.\n    - Success mode: Entities are connected successfully.\n    - Failure mode: Entities are not connected due to incorrect prototype or entities not being adjacent.\n  - `get_entity(prototype, position)`: Retrieves an entity of the given prototype at the specified position. Returns the entity if found.\n    - Success mode: Entity is retrieved successfully.\n    - Failure mode: Entity is not found at the specified position, resulting in an Exception."}
