{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- Consists of:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, currently holding 37 iron plates.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, currently holding 90 iron plates.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, currently holding 88 iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\n- Consists of:\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of transport belts and a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore extraction and transport.\n  - Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest and other entities.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- Consists of:\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to transport belts and a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) for iron ore extraction and storage.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) for moving items from belts to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\n- Consists of:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing 306 iron plates.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) for moving items into the chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage Chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5) currently empty.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n### Conveyor Belt Network\n- Extensive network of BeltGroups connecting various mining drills, furnaces, and chests across the map for efficient transport of resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inspect_inventory with incorrect argument types\n- Ensure that the first argument passed to `inspect_inventory` is an Entity or Position object, not a BeltGroup object. Adjust the code to pass the correct type to avoid ValueError.\n\n### Warnings for Furnaces with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings and improve production efficiency.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items to avoid them being in a waiting state and improve throughput."}
