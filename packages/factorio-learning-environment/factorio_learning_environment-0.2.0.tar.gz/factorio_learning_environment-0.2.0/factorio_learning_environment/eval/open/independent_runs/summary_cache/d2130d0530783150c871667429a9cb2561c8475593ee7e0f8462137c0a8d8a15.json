{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), status: WORKING\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0), status: NO_FUEL\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5), status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Pipe-group at position (-5.5, 16.5), status: EMPTY\n- Pipe-group at position (-8.5, 23.5), status: FULL_OUTPUT\n- Electricity-group at position (-5.4, 20.0), status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors Between Entities\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Make sure to insert fuel (such as coal) into the boiler to keep it operational. Regularly check the fuel levels to avoid interruptions in the power generation process.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure that the required items, such as small electric poles, are available in the inventory before attempting to place them. Craft necessary items in advance to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Electric Network Connection\n- Verify that the electricity network is properly connected. Ensure that electric poles are placed correctly to connect all entities needing power.\n\n### Resource Availability\n- Keep an eye on the availability of resources like coal and iron plates to maintain continuous production and avoid status issues like NO_INGREDIENTS in the stone furnace.\n\n### Error Handling in Code\n- Handle exceptions such as IndexError and ensure that entity lists are not empty before accessing them. Implement checks to prevent runtime errors due to missing entities."}
