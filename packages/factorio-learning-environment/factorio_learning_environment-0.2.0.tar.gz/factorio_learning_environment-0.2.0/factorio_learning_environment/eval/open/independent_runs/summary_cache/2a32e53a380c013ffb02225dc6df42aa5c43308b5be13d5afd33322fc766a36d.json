{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with a full output of iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving power\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science pack at Position (not specified), not receiving power\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, attempting to connect entities but failing due to missing items in inventory\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities to Power Network\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network. Craft or acquire necessary items like Small Electric Poles.\n\n### Errors with Lab and Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the power network. Check for any missing connections or misaligned poles.\n\n### Errors with Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces to prevent production halts due to full output inventory.\n\n### Errors with Empty Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate. Regularly supply them with required resources to maintain production efficiency."}
