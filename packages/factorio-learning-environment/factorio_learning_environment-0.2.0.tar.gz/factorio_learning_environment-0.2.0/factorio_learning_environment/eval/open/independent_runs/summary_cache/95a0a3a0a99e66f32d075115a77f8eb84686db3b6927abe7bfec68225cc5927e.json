{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mine at position (41, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position (41, -82)) with fuel inventory of 50 coal\n- Wooden chest (position (40.5, -83.5)) with inventory of 800 coal\n- Wooden chest (position (41.5, -83.5)) with inventory of 435 coal\n- Burner inserter (position (39.5, -81.5)) with fuel inventory of 15 coal\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position (0, 0)) with fuel inventory of 50 coal\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* **Error when inserting coal into burner-mining-drill**: The burner-mining-drill's inventory is full. Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before attempting to insert coal.\n* **Error when extracting coal from coal chest**: The extraction failed. Check the chest's inventory and ensure that the agent has permission to extract items from the chest.\n* **Error when inserter is waiting for source items**: The inserter is waiting for source items, but the source chest is empty or the inserter does not have permission to pick up items. Ensure that the source chest is not empty and the inserter has permission to pick up items.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n\t+ `coal_chest`: a wooden chest with inventory of 800 coal\n\t+ `iron_chest`: a wooden chest with inventory of 435 coal\n\t+ `drill`: a burner mining drill with fuel inventory of 50 coal\n\t+ `inserter`: a burner inserter with fuel inventory of 15 coal\n\t+ `furnace`: a stone furnace with fuel inventory of 50 coal\n* Utility functions:\n\t+ `insert_item`: inserts an item into an entity's inventory. Failed when the entity's inventory is full.\n\t+ `extract_item`: extracts an item from an entity's inventory. Failed when the extraction is not possible.\n\t+ `get_entity_status`: gets the status of an entity.
