{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) and a stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) with a burner inserter at position (18.5, 77.5) that puts into the furnace. The output of the furnace is put into a wooden chest at position (18.5, 76.5) by the burner inserter.\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(21.5, 72.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill at position (21.5, 72.5) and a stone furnace at position (20.0, 76.0).\n\n### Electricity Generator at position(-2.5, -0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5), boiler at position (-7.0, -0.5), and steam engine at position (-2.5, -0.5). The offshore pump is connected to the boiler with a pipe, and the boiler is connected to the steam engine with a pipe.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities too far away from the player position:\n  - Ensure you are close enough to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n* Errors when placing entities with insufficient spacing or incorrect direction:\n  - Ensure there is enough space around the reference entity and adjust the direction or spacing as needed.\n* Errors when inserting items into an entity without having the required items in the inventory:\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n* Errors when crafting items that require sub-ingredients:\n  - Ensure you have the required sub-ingredients in your inventory or can craft them before attempting to craft the item. For raw resources like stone, ensure you can gather them before crafting.\n* Errors when extracting items from an entity that does not contain the item:\n  - Ensure the entity contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n* Errors when getting an entity at a specific position:\n  - Ensure an entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nHowever, some important variables that have been assigned are:\n- `drill`: Electric mining drill entity\n- `furnace`: Stone furnace entity\n- `output_inserter`: Burner inserter entity\n- `output_chest`: Wooden chest entity \n- `furnace2`: Stone furnace entity\n\nThese variables are used to store references to entities on the map. Their types are respective entity types (e.g., ElectricMiningDrill, StoneFurnace, BurnerInserter, WoodenChest)."}
