Regularly check the inventory of coal and other fuel sources.\n\n- **Errors when using inserters waiting for items**\n  - Check the inventory of the source and destination entities to ensure that inserters have items to transfer and space to place items. Adjust the setup if necessary to avoid waiting states.\n\n- **Errors when extracting from entities**\n  - Ensure that you are extracting from the correct entity and that the entity has items available for extraction. \n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined or invoked.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int"}
