{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities:\n  - Pipe at position (x=1.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=17.5, y=17.5)\n  - Pipe-to-ground at position (x=16.5, y=17.5)\n  - Additional pipes forming a network between positions (x=9.5, y=15.5) and (x=4.5, y=20.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Steam Pipe Network (fluid_system=28125) connecting various entities, working status.\n- Water Pipe Network (fluid_system=28137) connecting offshore pump to boiler, full output status.\n- Empty Pipe Network (fluid_system=28135) with no fluid, indicating potential for future use.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity poles forming a network at positions such as (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=10.5, y=13.5), etc., providing power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe network is correctly aligned and that there are no gaps between the pipes and the target entities.\n- Verify that the pipe types (e.g., Pipe vs. UndergroundPipe) are compatible with the connection points and intended use.\n- Check for any obstructions or incorrect placements that might prevent successful connections.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(Position, Position, Set[Prototype])`: Attempts to connect entities at specified positions using the provided prototypes. Errors indicate failure in establishing a connection, possibly due to misalignment or incompatible pipe types.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of connected entities, including positions and prototypes used for connections.\n- `inventory`: Dictionary representing the current inventory of items, such as 'pipe', 'boiler', 'burner-mining-drill', etc.\n- `fluid_systems`: Identifiers for different fluid networks, indicating the current status and fluid type within each system."}
