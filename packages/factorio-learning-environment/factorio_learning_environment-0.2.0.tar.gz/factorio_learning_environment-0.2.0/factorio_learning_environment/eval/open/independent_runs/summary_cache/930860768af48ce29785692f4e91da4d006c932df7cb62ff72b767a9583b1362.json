{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with iron ore being inserted.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) moving items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items to move from one chest to another.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) moving items between chests and belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserter to pick up. This can be resolved by checking the supply chain feeding into the inserter to ensure it is not interrupted.\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- When connecting transport belts, ensure there are no gaps between them. Align belts correctly to maintain a continuous path for item transportation.\n\n### Furnace Warnings: No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply of raw materials feeding into the furnace to avoid downtime."}
