{"content": "Let me analyze what happened in our interaction with the Factorio API:\n\nWHAT WE ATTEMPTED:\n1. Find and harvest stone to craft a furnace\n2. Craft a stone furnace\n3. Get iron ore\n4. Place furnace near drill\n5. Add fuel and ore to furnace\n\nSUCCESSFUL ACTIONS:\n1. Found and harvested stone successfully\n2. Successfully crafted the stone furnace\n3. Found and harvested iron ore\n4. Successfully placed the furnace\n5. Added fuel and ore to the furnace\n\nKEY LEARNINGS:\n1. Raw resources (like stone) must be harvested, not crafted\n2. The `nearest()` function is useful for finding resources\n3. Need to check entity status and warnings to debug issues\n4. Position matters when placing entities\n5. The drill has a specific drop position we need to work with\n\nTIPS FOR FUTURE:\n1. Always check entity status and warnings\n2. Use `inspect_inventory()` to verify resources\n3. Pay attention to positioning when placing entities\n4. Remember to fuel burner entities\n5. Check entity output with `get_entities()` for debugging\n\nSUCCESSFUL PATTERN:\n```python\n# Find resource\nresource_pos = nearest(Resource.ResourceType)\n\n# Move and harvest\nmove_to(resource_pos)\nharvest_resource(resource_pos, quantity=needed_amount)\n\n# Craft if needed\ncraft_item(Prototype.ItemType, quantity=1)\n\n# Place and fuel entities\nentity = place_entity(Prototype.EntityType, position=target_pos)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Fuel, entity, quantity=5)\n```\n\nThis pattern ensures we have the resources before crafting and proper setup of entities.", "summary_range": "[1-3472]"}
