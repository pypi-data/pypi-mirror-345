{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting water from offshore pump to boiler and steam from boiler to steam engine\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for coal collection\n- Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for additional storage\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for transferring items\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting\n\n### Power Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with multiple poles connecting the lab at position (x=5.5, y=5.5) to the power source at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with belts transporting coal and other materials between various positions\n\n### Storage and Inventory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chests at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) for storing coal and iron plates\n- Wooden Chests for additional storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Electricity Group Connections\n- Ensure all electricity poles are correctly connected to form a complete circuit. Verify connections between poles and the power source to avoid \"No electricity group found\" errors.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Group Connections\n- Check the connections of pipes to ensure a continuous flow of fluids. Verify that all pipes are connected properly to avoid \"No pipe group found\" errors.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests. Ensure that there is adequate space in chests for continued operation.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that the power network is fully operational and connected to all necessary entities to avoid power-related issues in the lab and other structures."}
