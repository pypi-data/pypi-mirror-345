{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for items on the ground or other entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are properly defined before use. For example, ensure 'ore_furnace' is defined before referencing it in any logic.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Verify that the items you intend to insert are available in your inventory. For instance, ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent entities\n- Confirm the existence of the entity from which you intend to extract items. Ensure the entity is correctly identified and contains the items you wish to extract.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that the output of entities like drills and furnaces is not blocked. Place appropriate sink entities, such as chests or belts, to accept outputs and prevent blockages."}
