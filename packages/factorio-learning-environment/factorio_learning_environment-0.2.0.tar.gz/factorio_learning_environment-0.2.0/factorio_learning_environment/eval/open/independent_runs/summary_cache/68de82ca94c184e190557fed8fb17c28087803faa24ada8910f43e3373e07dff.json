{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), which extracts resources and is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for temporary storage of extracted materials.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring materials from the chests to the furnaces.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), facilitating movement of materials between entities.\n  - At position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron plates from furnaces to storage.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing finished iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Inserters Waiting for Space\n- Ensure that the destination of the inserter has enough space to accommodate items being transferred. Regularly check and clear out storage chests to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of inserters and refuel them as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Burner Mining Drills and Inserters Running Out of Fuel\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills and inserters to prevent interruptions in resource extraction and material handling. Keep a steady supply of coal or other fuel types in your inventory for refueling purposes.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to prevent idle time. Regularly check the inventory of furnaces and supply them with necessary resources.\n\n### Errors when Attempting to Insert Items without Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that your inventory contains the required items. Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid such errors."}
