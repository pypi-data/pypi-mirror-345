### NO DEPENDENCIES REQUIRED

Joke Python module for making your code *\'more readable\'*.

Has a weird naming scheme, random abstracted functions for no reason, and anything else that you could ever want!

  

# Functions

  

-  **Return_Value_Of(Value)** - Returns Value OFC (useless)

- **Crash()** - Will probably crash your window

-  **Print(Message) / Range(Number) / Len(List) / Int(Number) / String(Message) / Bool(Boolean)  / Float(Decimal) / List(Array)** - The corresponding function but capitalised

-  **Print_Multiple_Times(Count, Msg)** - Prints Msg Count amount of times

-  **Sum_Multiple_Numbers(Numbers)** - Sums multiple numbers

-  **Multiply_Multiple_Numbers(Numbers)** - Multiplies multiple numbers

-  **For_Loop(List, Code, PassElement, Arguments)** - Creates a for loop iterating over a list, where the body code is a function, and the extra arguments (first of which will be the element if PassElement is true) goes into lambda. *This function has some limitations such as not being able to modify values outside of it as a normal one would.*

-  **Get_Input_From_User(Message, Type = String)** - Gets an input from the user and applies a function to that input (intended to change the input type which is by default string)
