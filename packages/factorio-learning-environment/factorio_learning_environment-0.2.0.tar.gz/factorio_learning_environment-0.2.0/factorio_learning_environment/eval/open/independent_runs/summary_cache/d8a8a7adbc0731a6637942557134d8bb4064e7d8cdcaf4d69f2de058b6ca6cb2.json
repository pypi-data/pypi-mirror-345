{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (4.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (6.0, 0.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to furnace operations\n- Ensure that each furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Currently, some furnaces are reporting \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n- Check the output inventory of the furnaces; if they are full, they will not be able to process new items. This can lead to inefficiencies in production.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it."}
