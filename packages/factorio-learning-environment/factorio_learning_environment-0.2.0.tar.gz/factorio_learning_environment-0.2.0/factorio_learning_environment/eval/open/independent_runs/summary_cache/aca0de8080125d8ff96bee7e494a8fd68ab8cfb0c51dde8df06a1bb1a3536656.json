{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5). The drill is currently operational with a fuel inventory of coal and has a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions:\n  - Chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional chests at positions (5.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (8.5, y=-60.5), and (9.5, y=-60.5) are empty.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - Furnace at (-15.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore and iron plate inventories.\n  - Furnace at (-13.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore and iron plate inventories.\n  - Furnace at (-11.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore and iron plate inventories.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions:\n  - Iron chest at (-5.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Additional iron chests at positions (-6.5, y=-50.5) and (-7.5, y=-50.5) are empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and other entities that rely on storage space.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int) -> None`: Used to insert items into a target entity. Ensure the inventory has sufficient items before calling this function to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_to_insert: int`: Represents the quantity of iron ore intended for insertion into furnaces.\n- `inventory: dict`: Stores the current inventory of items, including 'wood', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
