{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully established on the map. Although several attempts were made to supply and craft a Laboratory at (0.5, 2.5), none of these efforts resulted in a completed structure. All final reports confirm that no entities are present on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API usage for entity retrieval \u2013 Calls to get_entities resulted in errors both when using an unsupported keyword (radius) and when passing positional arguments. Verify the function\u2019s signature and use only the supported parameters.\n\u2022 Iterating over entity results \u2013 Filtering operations on the output of get_entities caused a TypeError when a None value was returned. Always check that the returned value is a valid list before iterating.\n\u2022 Structure placement \u2013 Attempts to place a Lab failed because no lab was available in the inventory. Confirm that all required items for placement are present before executing placement commands.\n\u2022 Lab crafting prerequisites \u2013 Multiple lab crafting errors indicate missing sub-ingredients such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper-cables. Ensure that all necessary resources and intermediate products are secured and that resource conversion (e.g., smelting or crafting intermediary parts) is completed before attempting to craft a Lab."}
