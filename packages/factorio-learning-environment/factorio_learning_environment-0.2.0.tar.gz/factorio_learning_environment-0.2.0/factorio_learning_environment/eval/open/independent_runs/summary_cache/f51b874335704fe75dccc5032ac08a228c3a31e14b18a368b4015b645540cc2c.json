{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with warnings for being out of fuel and having a full chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5). The drill is extracting iron ore and has neighbors:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (5.5, -60.5)\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) (drop position)\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 9) and warning for no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 40) and warning for no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 50), warnings for no ingredients to smelt and full fuel source.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** for storage purposes at positions:\n  - (5.5, -60.5)\n  - (7.5, -60.5)\n  - (6.5, -60.5)\n  - (9.5, -60.5)\n  - (8.5, -60.5)\n  - (4.5, -58.5)\n  - (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check fuel levels and refill as necessary to avoid stoppages.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting due to full inventories. Implement a system to transport items from full chests to processing or storage areas.\n\n### Errors with Ingredient Supply\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to smelt. Check and maintain a steady flow of raw materials to avoid production halts.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs provided.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: Represents the mining drill entity with attributes such as fuel, position, and status.\n  - `wooden-chest`: Represents storage entities with attributes such as position and inventory status.\n  - `stone-furnace`: Represents the furnace entity with attributes such as fuel, position, and smelting status."}
