{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5), currently working with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Chests** for storage:\n  - Wooden chest at position (5.5, y=-60.5) with iron plates.\n  - Wooden chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) with iron ore.\n- **Furnaces** for smelting iron ore:\n  - Stone furnace at position (-15.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Chests** for storing iron plates:\n  - Wooden chests at positions (7.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5), and (8.5, y=-60.5) each containing iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) containing a mix of iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Resource Transfer\n- Ensure that the second argument in resource transfer functions is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. This will prevent errors like \"The second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup, you passed in a <class 'entities.Position'>\".\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full chests, as indicated by the warning \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron ore extracted and transferred.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron plates extracted and transferred.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal inserted into mining drills and furnaces."}
