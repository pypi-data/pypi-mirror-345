The first stone furnace (position: 0.0, 0.0) has 7 wood as fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n2. The second furnace (position: -1.0, 2.0) has 15 wood but also no ingredients to smelt.\n3. The third furnace (position: 1.0, 2.0) is out of fuel and cannot smelt anything.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. We need one more iron plate to reach the required total of 5 for crafting a burner mining drill.\n2. We can either smelt more iron ore or check if we have enough resources to craft the drill directly.\n\nLet's check our inventory to see if we have any iron ore left to smelt or if we need to gather more resources.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the current inventory for iron ore\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current Inventory: {current_inventory}\")  # Display current inventory to assess next steps\n\n# Determine if we need to gather more iron ore or can craft the burner mining drill\nif current_inventory.get(Prototype.IronOre, 0) > 0:\n    print(\"We have iron ore available to smelt.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"We need to gather more iron ore to smelt.\")", "summary_range": "[1-68]"}
