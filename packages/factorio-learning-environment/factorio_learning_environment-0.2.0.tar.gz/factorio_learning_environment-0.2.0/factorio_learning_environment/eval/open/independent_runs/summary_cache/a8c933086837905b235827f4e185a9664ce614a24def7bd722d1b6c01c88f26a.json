{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at position(41.0, -85.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining coal (position 41.0, -85.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -83.5) moving coal from drill to chest\n- Wooden chest for coal storage (position 43.5, -83.5)\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System 1 at position(-20.0, -54.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore (position -20.0, -54.0)\n- Stone furnace for smelting iron plates (position -20.0, -56.0)\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System 2 at position(-14.0, -56.0) \nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore (position -14.0, -56.0)\n- Stone furnace for smelting iron plates (position -14.0, -58.0)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Positioning Errors\n- The furnaces were repeatedly repositioned, causing interruptions in production\n- Ensure furnaces are placed at the correct drop positions initially to avoid need for repositioning\n- Current furnace positions are not aligned with drill drop positions, causing \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" errors\n\n### Resource Flow Issues\n- Multiple \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" states in furnaces indicate issues with ore delivery\n- Ensure furnaces are placed where they can receive ore from the mining drills\n- Current setup has drills dropping ore at positions that don't align with furnace input positions\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drop_position`: Position - Coordinates where entities output their products\n- `position`: Position - Base coordinates of entities\n- `status`: EntityStatus - Current operational status of entities\n- `fuel`: Inventory - Fuel contents of burner entities\n\n### Entity States\n- `EntityStatus.WORKING`: Entity is functioning normally\n- `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`: Entity lacks required input materials\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION`: Entity cannot output due to blocked destination"}
