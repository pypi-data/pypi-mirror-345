{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at position (2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Cable factory input chest at position (2.5, 17.5)\n\u2013 Burner inserter at position (2.5, 16.5)\n\u2013 Burner inserter at position (3.5, 17.5) using direction RIGHT\n\u2013 Assembling machine at position (1.5, 19.5)\n\n### Belt Depot System at position (3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Wooden chest placed at position (3.5, 15.5) to serve as a belt depot\n\u2013 Dedicated transport belt segment at position (4.5, 15.5) adjacent to the depot chest\n\u2013 Depot burner inserter at position (3.5, 14.5) using direction UP\n\n### Extraction System at position (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n\u2013 Extraction system burner inserter at position (\u20133.5, 27.5) with drop position (\u20133.5, 28.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Errors\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 When connecting transport belts, the target must be a valid inserter rather than a steam engine. Repeated failures occurred because transport belts were attempted to be connected directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine object. Always insert an intermediary inserter to input items into the steam engine.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Issues\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Placement errors for the wooden chest were observed due to the target position being too far from the player and a lack of the required item in inventory. To avoid these issues, move sufficiently close to the target location and verify that the necessary entity is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Reference\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 A NameError arose from using an undefined variable (target_chest). Ensure that all variables are declared properly and referenced consistently prior to use."}
