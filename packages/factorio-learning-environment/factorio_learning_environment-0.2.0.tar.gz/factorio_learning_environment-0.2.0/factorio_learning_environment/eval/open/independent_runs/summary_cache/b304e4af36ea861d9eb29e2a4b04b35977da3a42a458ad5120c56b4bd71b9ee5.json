{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at position(-5.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-2.0, 23.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting these components:\n  - Water input pipes at (-9.5, 23.5)\n  - Steam output pipes near engine at various positions\n  - Horizontal pipe sections at multiple y-levels (y=19.5, y=20.5, etc)\n- Small electric pole at (-5.5, 10.5)\n\n###Iron Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at position(-14.5, -48.5) collecting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position(-14.0, -47.0) smelting iron plates\n\n###Additional Smelting Array\nMultiple stone furnaces for smelting:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) \n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n###Automation Science Pack Production\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position(24.5, 4.5)\n- Input chest at position(21.5, 4.5) with iron plates\n- Output chest at position(27.5, 4.5) with copper plates and science packs\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - At position(22.5, 4.5) moving items from input chest\n  - At position(26.5, 4.5) moving items to output chest\n\n###Research Lab Array\nMultiple labs connected to electricity network id 99445, positioned across the map\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes in occupied spaces\n- Check if target position is already occupied by another entity before placing pipes\n- Remove existing pipes/entities before attempting to place new ones in the same location\n\n### Errors when placing pipes over water\n- Avoid placing pipes directly over water tiles\n- Use offshore pumps to extract water, then connect pipes from there\n\n### Errors when placing underground pipes\n- Ensure you have the correct item (pipe-to-ground) in inventory before attempting placement\n\n### Entity connection errors\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities that need to connect (like pipes to steam engines)\n- Verify connection points are aligned correctly between entities\n\n### Power network issues\n- Connect power poles to create a complete electrical network\n- Ensure steam engines are properly connected to boilers via pipes\n- Check fluid connections are complete for power generation system"}
