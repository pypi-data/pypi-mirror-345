{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 24.0) with fuel inventory containing 14 units of coal.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-1.5, 24.5) connected to the boiler, generating electricity.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, facilitating fluid transport.\n\n### Smelting Setup at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently inactive.\n- **Inserter** at position (6.5, -60.5) waiting for source items, connected to a small electric pole and a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5), storing various items including iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- **Lab** with input for automation science packs but no research currently in progress.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- **Electricity Group** with multiple small electric poles providing power to connected entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a boiler without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors in Setting Research\n- Verify that the technology you are trying to set for research is available and that the lab has the necessary science packs. Attempting to set research without meeting these conditions will cause an error."}
