{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that waits for space in destination\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) that stores coal\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that stores iron ore\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to fuel depletion**: The burner mining drills at positions (42.0, -83.0) and (-15.0, -50.0) frequently report \"NO_FUEL\". Ensure to regularly check and refill fuel for mining drills to maintain their operation.\n- **Errors when inserting items into entities**: The burner inserters at positions (42.5, -80.5) and (43.5, -81.5) often report \"WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\" or \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\". Ensure that there are sufficient items in the source and space in the destination before inserting.\n- **Errors when the Stone Furnace has no ingredients**: The Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) sometimes reports \"NO_INGREDIENTS\". Ensure to keep the furnace supplied with iron ore for continuous operation.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: \n  - No specific utility functions have been defined or invoked successfully.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n  - `wood`: int"}
