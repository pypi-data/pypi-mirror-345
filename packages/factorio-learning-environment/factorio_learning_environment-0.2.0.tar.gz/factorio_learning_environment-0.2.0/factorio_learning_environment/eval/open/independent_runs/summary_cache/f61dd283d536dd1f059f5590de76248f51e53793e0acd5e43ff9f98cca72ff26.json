{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Electricity Generation Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 17.5) not connected to fluid.\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 22.0) out of fuel.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) supplying water.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with no research in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing objects or unplaceable terrain like water.\n\n### Errors when trying to get entities at incorrect positions\n- Verify the position and existence of entities before attempting to retrieve them. Double-check coordinates and ensure the entity type matches.\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. Craft or acquire missing items beforehand."}
