Use the proper signature (e.g. do not supply a keyword argument like \u201cradius\u201d if not supported, and ensure that the expected number of positional arguments is met).\n  \n\u2022 Return Value Handling \u2013 When a function (such as get_entities) might return None, validate its output before iterating over it to prevent \u201cNoneType\u201d errors. Adopt a fallback (e.g. default to an empty list) when necessary.\n  \n\u2022 Inventory Verification \u2013 Confirm that a required item (for example, a Lab) is present in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map, preventing placement errors due to missing inventory items.\n  \n\u2022 Resource Chain Management in Crafting \u2013 When crafting complex items like a Lab, ensure that all prerequisite sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are sufficiently available. Verify resource availability and production capabilities for each dependency to avoid crafting failures."}
