The error indicates that the inventory is full, which prevents the insertion of coal into the furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This is particularly relevant for inserting items into furnaces that are already at capacity.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This ensures that you are within range to perform the extraction action."}
