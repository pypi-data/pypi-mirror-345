{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (2.5, 0.5), connected to the power network\n- Small electric poles connecting the steam engine to the lab\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- Water Pipe Group: Connects offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) to the boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Pipe Group: Connects the boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0) to the steam engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n\n### Electricity Group\n- Consists of small electric poles at positions (1.5, 14.5), (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 6.5), (1.5, 10.5), and (1.5, 2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Lab Entity\n- Ensure that the lab entity is correctly defined and placed on the map before attempting to interact with it. Use the correct class name and check for its existence at the specified position.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure all necessary pipes are available in the inventory before attempting to connect them. Verify that the pipes are correctly aligned and placed to connect the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine and Boiler\n- Ensure the boiler is adequately fueled with coal to maintain the steam engine's operation. Regularly check the coal inventory and refuel as necessary.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Network\n- Ensure that all necessary electric poles are placed and connected to provide power to the lab and other structures. Verify the connectivity of the power network to avoid power shortages.\n\n### Assertion Errors with Steam Engine\n- Regularly verify the status of the steam engine to ensure it is working. If not, check the fuel supply and the connectivity of the pipes and electric poles.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly named and defined in the code. Double-check for typos or incorrect references to entity names."}
