{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) containing coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) containing coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing coal\n- Transport Belt connecting these chests\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) receiving items from the inserter\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) supplied with copper ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) receiving items from the inserter\n\n### Transport and Inserter System\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=4.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5)\n- Multiple Burner Inserters positioned to transfer items between chests and belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity has sufficient items to extract. If an extraction fails, verify the inventory of the target entity before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors Related to Inserters\n- Make sure that the destination for inserters is not blocked. Clear space in the destination chest or belt to prevent inserters from waiting for space.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Verify that the placement location is valid and not occupied by another entity before attempting to place new structures or items.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. If a tile is occupied by another entity, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or altering the reference position to avoid collisions."}
