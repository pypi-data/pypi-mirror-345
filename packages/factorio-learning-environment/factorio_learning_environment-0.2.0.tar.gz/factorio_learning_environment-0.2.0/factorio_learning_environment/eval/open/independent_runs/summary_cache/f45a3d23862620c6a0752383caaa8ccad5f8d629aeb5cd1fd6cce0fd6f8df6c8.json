{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which serves as an intermediate storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) that transfers items between the chests.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or empty entities\n- Ensure that the target entity, such as a chest, exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract from it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target tile is unoccupied. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities near other entities\n- When placing entities like chests or inserters next to existing structures, ensure there is adequate space and no obstructions. Adjust the spacing or direction if necessary to prevent placement failures."}
