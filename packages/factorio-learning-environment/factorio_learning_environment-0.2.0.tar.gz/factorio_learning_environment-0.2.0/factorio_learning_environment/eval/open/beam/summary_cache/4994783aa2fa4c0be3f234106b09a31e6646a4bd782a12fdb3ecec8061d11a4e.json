{"content": "The error indicates that the offshore pump cannot be placed because the target position is too far from the player's current position. In Factorio, entities can only be placed within a certain range of the player's position. Here's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Move Closer to the Target Position**: Before placing the offshore pump, ensure that the player is within the allowed range of the target position.\n\n2. **Calculate a Suitable Position**: If the target position is too far, you may need to move the player closer or adjust the target position to be within range.\n\nHere's an updated approach to handle the situation:\n\n```python\n# Determine the nearest water source position\nwater_position = nearest(Resource.Water)\n\n# Check if the player is within range to place the offshore pump\nplayer_position = get_player_position()\ndistance_to_water = calculate_distance(player_position, water_position)\n\nif distance_to_water > 10:\n    # Move the player closer to the water source\n    move_player_towards(water_position, max_distance=10)\n    print(f\"Player moved closer to water source.

Ensure these functions are defined in your environment.", "summary_range": "[1-266]"}
