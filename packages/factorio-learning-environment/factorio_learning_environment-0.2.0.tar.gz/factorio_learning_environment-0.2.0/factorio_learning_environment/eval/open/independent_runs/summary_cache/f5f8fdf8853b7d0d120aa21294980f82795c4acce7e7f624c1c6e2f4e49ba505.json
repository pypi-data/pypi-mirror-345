All attempts to place entities have failed, and the map remains empty of any constructed structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest, Stone Furnace, Ore Inserter, Plate Inserter, and Output Chest**: Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity being placed. Check for any obstructions or incorrect positioning that might prevent placement.\n\n### Errors related to movement\n- **Error moving to areas**: Ensure that the `Position` object is correctly used and callable. Verify that the movement commands are correctly formatted and that all indices or properties are accessed properly.\n\n### Errors with building box size\n- **No viable place to put Prototype.WoodenChest with the given BuildingBox size**: Consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to find a suitable placement area.\n\n### General API usage errors\n- **String indices must be integers**: Ensure that when accessing elements of a string or similar data structure, indices are correctly specified as integers. Double-check the data type being accessed to prevent such errors."}
