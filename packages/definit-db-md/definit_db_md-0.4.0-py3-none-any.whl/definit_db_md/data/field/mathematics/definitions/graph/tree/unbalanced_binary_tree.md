A [binary tree](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/tree/binary_tree.md) that does not satisfy the [balanced binary tree](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/tree/balanced_binary_tree.md) property. In an unbalanced binary tree, the depth of the two [subtrees](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/tree/subtree.md) of at least one [node](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/node.md) differs by more than one.
