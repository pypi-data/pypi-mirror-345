{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Fueled by coal but currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5): Feeds iron ore into the stone furnace. Fueled by coal and operational, waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-2.5, 0.5): Collects iron plates from the burner inserter. Currently contains iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (2.0, 0.0): Used for smelting copper ore into copper plates. Fueled by coal but currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore. Fueled by coal and operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -51.5): Collects iron ore from the burner mining drill.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-28.0, -61.0): Extracts copper ore. Fueled by coal and operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-28.5, -62.5): Collects copper ore from the burner mining drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, attempting to place a burner mining drill without having one in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an entity that does not contain them\n- Verify that the entity contains the desired items before attempting to extract them. An error occurred when trying to extract iron plates from the furnace when none were available.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Confirm that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For instance, trying to insert coal into a drill without having coal in the inventory led to an error.\n\n### Errors when using uninitialized or incorrect API calls\n- Ensure that all API calls are correctly initialized and that the objects being manipulated are valid. An error was encountered when attempting to connect entities with an uninitialized or incorrect attribute.\n\n### Errors when furnace is not producing iron plates\n- Ensure that the furnace is adequately supplied with both fuel and iron ore to maintain continuous production of iron plates. An error was encountered when the furnace was not producing iron plates due to insufficient iron ore.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources\n- Ensure that all necessary resources are available before attempting to craft items. An error occurred when trying to craft a burner mining drill without having the required stone, which is a raw resource that must be gathered first.\n\n### Errors when crafting copper cables without copper plates\n- Ensure that copper plates are available before attempting to craft copper cables. An error occurred when trying to craft copper cables without having the required copper plates.\n\n### Errors when furnace is not producing copper plates\n- Ensure that the furnace is adequately supplied with copper ore to maintain continuous production of copper plates. An error was encountered when the furnace was not producing copper plates due to insufficient copper ore.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient copper ore in inventory\n- Ensure that there is a sufficient amount of copper ore in the inventory before attempting to replenish furnaces. An error occurred when the inventory did not have enough copper ore to meet the required threshold.\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. An error occurred when trying to move to a position using an undefined variable `drill_copper`.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. An error occurred when trying to connect entities using a transport belt without having the transport belt in the inventory."}
