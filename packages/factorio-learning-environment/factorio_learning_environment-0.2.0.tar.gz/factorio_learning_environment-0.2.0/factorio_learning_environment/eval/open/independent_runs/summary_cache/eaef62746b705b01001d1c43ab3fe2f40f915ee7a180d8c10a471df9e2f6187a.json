{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the Offshore Pump to the Steam Engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items from the furnace to a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Storage and Miscellaneous\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates\n\n### Power Network\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles distributed around the map, currently not connected to the power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Resources\n- Ensure you have enough resources before attempting to connect entities. For example, attempting to connect Small Electric Poles without having them in the inventory will fail.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Power Network\n- Verify that all components of the power network are properly connected. Ensure that Small Electric Poles are placed within range and connected to the power grid to supply electricity to all necessary entities.\n\n### Assertion Error for Copper Plates\n- Before executing operations that depend on a certain number of items, such as copper plates, make sure to verify that the required quantity is available in the inventory to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Output or No Ingredients\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces and ensure that they have the necessary ingredients to continue production. For example, a furnace with a full output or lacking ingredients will halt production.\n\n### Warnings for Not Connected Entities\n- Address warnings such as \"not connected to power network\" or \"no fluid present in connections\" by ensuring all necessary connections are made and resources are available."}
