{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Boiler at Position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Pipe Group connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler with pipes at Positions (-2.5, 26.5) and (-3.5, 26.5)\n\n#### Coal Mining Facility at Position (38.0, -87.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (38.0, -87.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (38.5, -85.5)\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (41.0, -87.0) with Wooden Chests at Positions (40.5, -85.5) and (41.5, -85.5)\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (39.5, -85.5) and (42.5, -85.5) connecting to the mining drills and chests\n\n#### Iron Plate Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (-15.0, -49.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n#### Copper Plate Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (-26.0, -61.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n#### Steam Engine Network\nConsists of multiple Steam Engines at various positions including:\n- Position (-13.5, 12.5)\n- Position (23.5, 15.5)\n- Position (-9.5, 17.5)\n- Position (-2.5, 18.5)\n- Position (13.5, 19.5)\n- Position (2.5, 21.5)\n- Position (25.5, 20.5)\n- Position (-5.5, 23.5)\n- Position (7.5, 23.5)\n- Position (8.5, 29.5)\n- Position (2.5, 31.5)\n- Position (3.5, 36.5)\n- Position (18.5, 46.5)\n- Position (23.5, 49.5)\n- Position (28.5, 49.5)\n- Position (37.5, 51.5)\n- Position (9.5, 57.5)\n- Position (22.5, 56.5)\n- Position (29.5, 56.5)\n- Position (42.5, 56.5)\n- Position (16.5, 58.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Boiler and Offshore Pump Connection\n- Ensure that the boiler and offshore pump are properly connected with pipes. The boiler status remains \"NOT_CONNECTED\" indicating a possible issue with the pipe configuration or placement.\n\n#### Errors with Steam Engine Connections\n- Many steam engines are not connected to the power network and lack input liquid. Ensure that steam engines are connected to the power network and have a supply of water.\n\n#### Chest Full Warnings\n- Several chests are full, preventing further mining operations. Regularly check and empty chests to ensure continuous operation.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check the supply chain to ensure items are being delivered to the inserters.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the count of various items in the player's inventory.\n- `pipe_group`: Dict[str, Any] - Represents the connection of pipes between entities.\n- `electricity_group`: Dict[str, Any] - Represents the network of electric poles and their connections.\n- `belt_group`: Dict[str, Any] - Represents the configuration and status of belts and their connections."}
