{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-13.5, 23.5)\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity but is currently not operational due to connectivity issues. It consists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-13.5, 23.5) - Status: Not Connected\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) - Status: Not Connected\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: Working\n\n### Pipe Network\nThis network is designed to transport fluids but currently has connectivity issues. It consists of:\n- Pipe Group at position (-4.5, 16.5) - Status: Empty\n- Pipe Group at position (-11.5, 19.5) - Status: Empty\n- Pipe Group at position (-10.5, 22.5) - Status: Empty\n- Pipe Group at position (-10.5, 23.5) - Status: Empty\n- Pipe Group at position (-9.5, 22.5) - Status: Full Output\n- Pipe Group at position (-8.5, 23.5) - Status: Full Output\n- Pipe Group at position (-7.5, 23.5) - Status: Empty\n- Pipe Group at position (-6.5, 21.5) - Status: Empty\n- Pipe Group at position (-5.5, 20.5) - Status: Empty\n- Pipe Group at position (-11.5, 24.5) - Status: Empty\n\n### Electricity Group at Position (-3.67, 20.21)\n- Status: Not Plugged into Electric Network\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Status: No Ingredients\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object at the target position before placing a pipe.\n- Verify that the target location is suitable for pipe placement and does not overlap with water or other entities.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that the required items, such as pipes or pipe-to-ground, are available in the inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Connectivity Issues\n- Check connections between entities like steam engines and boilers to ensure they are properly linked to function as intended.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- When crafting items, ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available and that the correct crafting method is used, such as using a furnace for smelting iron plates.\n\n### Smelting Errors\n- Ensure that both iron ore and coal are available in the inventory before attempting to smelt iron ore in the furnace."}
