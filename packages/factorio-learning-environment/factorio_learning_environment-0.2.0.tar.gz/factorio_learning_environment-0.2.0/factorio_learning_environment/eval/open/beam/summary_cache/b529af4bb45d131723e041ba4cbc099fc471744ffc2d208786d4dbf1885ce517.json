{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has once again failed to yield the expected results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace still holds **18 Iron Plates** and does not show any indication that the newly inserted stone has been recognized.\n- The furnace remains in a **\"WORKING\"** state, but it is not processing any materials, indicating a persistent issue with ingredient recognition.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **0 pieces of stone** remaining (after loading attempts)\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not processing the stone or Copper Ore, despite having the necessary ingredients for smelting.\n- The furnace's status suggests it is operational but not engaging in any production, which could imply a configuration or state management issue.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Reset the Furnace**: Since the furnace is not recognizing inputs, I will attempt to reset its state by removing any held items, even if they are not visible.\n2. **Reinsert Ingredients**: After resetting, I will reinsert both **2 pieces of stone** and **1 piece of Copper Ore** to see if this resolves the issue.\n3. **Monitor for Smelting Activity**: Observe if the furnace begins to smelt after these actions.\n\nLet's proceed by attempting to extract any items from the active furnace to reset its state. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Attempt to extract Iron Plates from the active furnace to reset its state\nextract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Extract all 3 pieces of Iron Plates currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting Iron Plates: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting Iron Plates: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-328]"}
