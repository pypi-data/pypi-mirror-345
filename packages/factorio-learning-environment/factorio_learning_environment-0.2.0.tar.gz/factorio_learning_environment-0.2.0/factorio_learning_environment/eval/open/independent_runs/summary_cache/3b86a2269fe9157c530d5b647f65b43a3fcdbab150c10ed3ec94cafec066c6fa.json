{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Direction: UP\n  - Fuel: 2 units of coal\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Direction: UP\n  - Fuel: 16 units of coal\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Furnace Source: 2 units of iron ore\n  - Furnace Result: 21 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Ensure the desired location for placing a Burner Inserter is not occupied by another entity or obstructed. Adjust the position as necessary before attempting to place the inserter.\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chest\n- Verify that the location for placing a Wooden Chest is clear and not obstructed by other entities. Adjust the position before placing the chest.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a Wooden Chest\n- Use an inserter to take items from a Wooden Chest before attempting to connect belts. Direct connections from a Wooden Chest to a belt are not possible.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure you have coal available before trying to insert it into a mining drill.\n\n### Warnings about blocked output\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage and ensure continuous operation."}
