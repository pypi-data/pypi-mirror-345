{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity generator at position(-6.5, 71.0)\nConsists of \n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 69.5)\n- Boiler at position(-6.5, 71.0)\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5, 71.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler and steam engine\n\n#### Iron ore mine and processing setup at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of \n- Electric mining drill at position(15.5, 70.5)\n- Wooden chest at position(15.5, 68.5)\n- Inserter at position(16.5, 68.5)\n- Two stone furnaces at positions(18.0, 69.0) and (20.0, 69.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities next to each other:\n  - Ensure there is enough space between entities to place new entities.\n  - Check if the target position is occupied by another entity or is not buildable (e.g., water).\n* Errors when placing entities too far away:\n  - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place the entity.\n* Common issues with entity placement:\n  - Increasing spacing or changing direction might resolve placement issues.\n  - Check for nearby entities that might be blocking the placement.\n* Errors when inspecting inventory of an entity:\n  - Ensure the entity exists and is not stale before attempting to inspect its inventory.\n* Errors when inserting items into an entity:\n  - Check if the entity has enough space to receive the items.\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them.\n* Errors due to undefined variables:\n  - Ensure all variables are defined before using them in your code. For example, the error in step 21 was caused by using an undefined variable 'entity'.\n* Attribute errors:\n  - Check the correct attribute names and values for entities and their statuses.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nThe following utility functions have been implicitly defined by the agent based on the execution logs. However, their exact signatures and descriptions can only be inferred.\n\n* `extract_items(entity, item_type)`: Extracts items of a specific type from an entity.\n    + Input: entity (Entity), item_type (str)\n    + Output: extracted items (int)\n    + Failure mode: When the entity does not contain the specified item type or is not accessible.\n* `move_items(source, destination, item_type)`: Moves items of a specific type from a source to a destination.\n    + Input: source (Entity or Inventory), destination (Entity or Inventory), item_type (str)\n    + Output: None\n    + Failure mode: When the source or destination is not accessible or does not contain/have space for the specified item type.\n* `add_fuel(entity, fuel_type)`: Adds fuel to an entity.\n    + Input: entity (Entity), fuel_type (str)\n    + Output: None\n    + Failure mode: When the entity does not accept the specified fuel type or is not accessible.\n\nImportant variables that have been assigned:\n* `iron_ore_count`: count of iron ore (int)\n* `iron_plate_count`: count of iron plates (int)\n* `coal_count`: count of coal (int)\n* `entity_status`: status of an entity (EntityStatus)\n* `inventory`: inventory of an entity or player (dict)"}
