{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-11.5, 69.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 69.5)\n- Boiler at position(-6.0, 71.5) - currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, 75.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups for water and steam\nThe system is currently not operational as the boiler has run out of fuel.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small electric poles connecting the steam engine to the mining drills and assembling machine\n- Expanded power network with poles at positions (4.5, 77.5), (8.5, 77.5), (12.5, 77.5), (16.5, 77.5), (20.5, 77.5), (24.5, 77.5), (28.5, 77.5), (28.5, 81.5), (33.5, 96.5), and many more\n- Additional poles placed at (35.5, 99.5), (28.5, 99.5), (24.5, 99.5), (24.5, 95.5), (24.5, 91.5), (24.5, 87.5), (24.5, 83.5), (24.5, 79.5), (20.5, 79.5), (16.5, 79.5), (12.5, 79.5), (8.5, 79.5), (4.5, 79.5), (0.5, 79.5), and (-0.5, 79.5)\n- Electricity group with ID 5923 spanning from the steam engine to the production areas\nThe power network is currently not operational due to the boiler being out of fuel.\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at Position(27.5, 85.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 at position(27.5, 85.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 at position(30.5, 85.5)\n- Small electric pole at position(29.5, 83.5)\n- Both drills are not operational due to lack of power, but are positioned over iron ore resources.\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at Position(28.0, 88.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 at position(28.0, 88.0) with coal fuel (6 coal)\n- Stone furnace 2 at position(31.0, 88.0) with coal fuel (6 coal)\n- Burner inserter 1 at position(28.5, 89.5) with coal fuel\n- Burner inserter 2 at position(31.5, 89.5) with coal fuel (4 coal)\n- Wooden chest 1 at position(28.5, 90.5) storing iron plates (empty)\n- Wooden chest 2 at position(31.5, 90.5) storing iron plates (13 plates)\n- Burner inserter at position(27.5, 90.5) taking items from chest 1 (4 coal)\n- Burner inserter at position(29.5, 90.5) taking items from chest 1 to belt (4 coal)\n- Burner inserter at position(31.5, 91.5) taking items from chest 2 to belt (4 coal)\nThe smelting area is operational despite the power outage, as the furnaces and inserters are burner-powered. The furnaces have iron ore in their input (92 ore each) and the first furnace has 62 iron plates in its output.\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Line at Position(33.5, 98.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at position(33.5, 98.5) set to produce iron gear wheels\n- Small electric pole at position(33.5, 96.5)\n- Small electric pole at position(35.5, 99.5)\n- Wooden chest at position(36.5, 98.5) storing iron gear wheels (88 wheels)\n- Output burner inserter at position(35.5, 98.5) with coal fuel (9"}
