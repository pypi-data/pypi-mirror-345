{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and currently working, but output is blocked due to no sink entity in place.\n  - Neighbour: Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-49.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-49.5)\n  - Fueled with coal, waiting for source items.\n  - Pickup position: (x=-12.5, y=-49.5), Drop position: (x=-14.5, y=-49.5).\n  - Neighbour: Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-47.0)\n  - Fueled with coal, but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fueled with coal, no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Contains 2 iron plates in the furnace result inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting without required resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are available in the inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates and stone are necessary for crafting a burner mining drill and stone furnace, respectively.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Verify that the entity you wish to place is present in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Confirm that you have the necessary items in your inventory before trying to insert them into another entity, such as a furnace or mining drill.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid conflicts with existing structures."}
