{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation System at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5), not connected to the power network, no input liquid, and no fluid present in connections.\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0), not connected, with warnings of a full chest, no input liquid, and no fluid present in connections.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), not connected, with no fluid present in connections.\n- Pipe network connecting various components, but currently empty and not effectively delivering fluids.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0), with a fuel inventory of coal and producing iron plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5), both with no power, waiting for source items, and not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5), serving as storage units.\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, part of an electricity group with no voltage, indicating a lack of power distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connection\n- Ensure all components of the electricity generation system (steam engine, boiler, offshore pump) are correctly connected to the power network. Check for missing connections and ensure fluid systems are operational.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source. Check the electricity distribution network for any disconnected or improperly placed electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Transport\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected and that there are no gaps in the fluid transport network. Ensure that the offshore pump is operational and supplying water to the boiler.\n\n### Errors in Resource Supply to Furnaces\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production. Check inserters and belts for any blockages or misalignments that may prevent items from reaching the furnace."}
