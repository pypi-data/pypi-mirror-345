{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) supplying iron ore to the furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** to facilitate the transfer of materials between entities.\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer Facility at Position (47.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) for processing coal.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring coal and iron plates between entities.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests at drop positions are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from halting operations. For example, the chest at position (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) are full, which stops the mining drills from continuing their work.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner inserters to maintain continuous operation. The burner inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) is out of fuel, which can disrupt the transfer of materials.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to avoid idle time. The furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) is currently without ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors with Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items to avoid idle time. The burner inserter at position (41.5, -78.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential supply chain issue."}
