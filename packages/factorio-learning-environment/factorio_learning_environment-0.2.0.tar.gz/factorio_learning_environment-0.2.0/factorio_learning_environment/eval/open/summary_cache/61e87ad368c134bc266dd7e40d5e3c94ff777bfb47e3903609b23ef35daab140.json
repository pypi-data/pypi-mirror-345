{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently without power and output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with frequent full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, with burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) feeding the chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt drop position remains unresolved, causing mining drill to be starved of power and output.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved inserter fueling and power connectivity, but output blockage and power issues persist.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), not connected to power network and lacking input fluid, currently not working.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5).\n\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity from steam power but is currently non-operational due to lack of fuel in boiler and no power connection for the steam engine.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), currently not powered and with full input inventory of iron plates but no output gear wheels.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), empty and ready to receive assembled items.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled with coal and operational but waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine input inventory remains full of iron plates and iron gear wheels, output inventory also contains these items, indicating assembly is not progressing or output is not being extracted.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and has power and inserter setups but is currently not producing due to assembler lacking power and output extraction issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage and power issues in mining and smelting structure\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains without power and blocked output due to furnace belt blockage.\n- The furnace output inventory frequently fills up, preventing further smelting and causing upstream blockage.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items and ensure power poles are placed to supply electricity to the mining drill.\n- Verify the power network is connected properly to all entities in this structure.\n\n### Steam power generation failures due to fuel and power connectivity\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, causing the steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) to have no input fluid and no power output.\n- Steam engine is not connected to the power network, preventing electricity generation.\n- Insert coal into the boiler to restart steam production.\n- Connect the steam engine to the power network with small electric poles to enable power generation.\n\n### Assembling machine input/output and power management\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) has full input inventory but no output extraction, and is not powered.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) is fueled but waiting for source items, indicating output extraction is not occurring.\n- Assembler input and output inventories contain iron plates and iron gear wheels, suggesting crafting is stalled.\n- Ensure the assembling machine is connected to power poles to enable operation.\n- Verify output inserters are correctly positioned and operational to move crafted items to output chests.\n- Regularly supply iron plates to input chests to maintain crafting.\n\n### Entity placement and"}
