{"content": "# It appears that there was an error when trying to insert coal into the furnace. The error message indicates that the `Position` object does not have an attribute `name`. This suggests that the `insert_item` function may require a different way to reference the furnace entity.\n\n# To resolve this, we need to ensure we are using the correct reference for the furnace entity. Instead of using the `furnace_position`, we should directly reference the furnace entity itself.\n\n# Let's correct the code by first obtaining a reference to the furnace after placing it, and then using that reference to insert items.\n\n# Step 1: Place the stone furnace and get its entity reference.\nfurnace_entity = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_position)\n\n# Step 2: Now, we will insert coal into the furnace using its entity reference.\ninsert_item(furnace_entity, Prototype.Coal, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 coal into the furnace\n\n# Step 3: Insert stone into the furnace to start smelting into stone bricks.\ninsert_item(furnace_entity, Prototype.Stone, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 stones into the furnace\n\n# Let's check the state of our furnace to ensure it is working properly.\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory: {furnace_inventory}\")  # Check what is in the furnace inventory\nprint(f\"Current Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check current player inventory after actions\n", "summary_range": "[1-8]"}
