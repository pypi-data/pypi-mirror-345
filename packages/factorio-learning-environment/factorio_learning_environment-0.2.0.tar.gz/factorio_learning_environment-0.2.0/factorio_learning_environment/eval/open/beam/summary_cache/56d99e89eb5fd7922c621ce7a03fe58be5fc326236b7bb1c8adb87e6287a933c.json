{"content": "The error indicates that the `Boiler` could not be placed at the specified position due to spatial constraints. This is a common issue when trying to place entities too close to each other or in unsuitable terrain. Let's adjust our approach to ensure successful placement:\n\n### Steps to Resolve Placement Issues:\n\n1. **Verify Terrain Suitability:**\n   - Ensure the target area is clear of obstacles and suitable for placing a boiler.\n   - Use a slightly larger spacing or adjust the position to ensure there's enough room.\n\n2. **Adjust Placement Logic:**\n   - Increase the spacing between the Offshore Pump and the Boiler.\n   - Check the terrain around the Offshore Pump to find a suitable position for the Boiler.\n\n### Updated Code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Confirm Offshore Pump placement\nwater_position = nearest(Resource.Water)\nmove_to(water_position)\noffshore_pump = place_entity(Prototype.OffshorePump, position=water_position)\nprint(f\"Offshore Pump successfully placed at: {offshore_pump.position}\")\n\n# Step 2: Find a suitable position for the Boiler\n# Attempt to place the Boiler with increased spacing\nboiler_position = Position(offshore_pump.position.x + 2, offshore_pump.position.y)  # Adjusted position\ntry:\n    boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=10)\n    print(f\"Boiler successfully placed at: {boiler.position}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to place Boiler: {e}\")\n\n# Step 3: Place the Steam Engine next to the Boiler\nsteam_engine_position = Position(boiler.position.x + 2, boiler.position.y)  # Adjusted position\ntry:\n    steam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=steam_engine_position)\n    print(f\"Steam Engine placed at: {steam_engine.position}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to place Steam Engine: {e}\")\n\n# Step 4: Establish connections\ntry:\n    connect_entities(offshore_pump, boiler, Prototype.Pipe)\n    connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine, Prototype.Pipe)\n    print(\"Successfully established water and steam connections.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to establish connections: {e}\")\n\n# Step 5: Place Small Electric Pole and connect it\nelectric_pole_position = Position(steam_engine.position.x + 1, steam_engine.position.y)\ntry:\n    electric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=electric_pole_position)\n    print(f\"Electric Pole installed at: {electric_pole.position}\")\n    connect_entities(steam_engine, electric_pole)\n    connect_entities(electric_pole, assembler)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to place or connect Electric Pole: {e}\")\n\n# Step 6: Verify power status\nassembler = get_entity(Prototype.AssemblingMachine1, assembler.position)\nprint(f\"Assembling Machine's power status: {assembler.status}\")\n```\n\n### Tips for Successful Placement:\n- **Spacing:** Ensure there's enough space between entities to avoid overlap or terrain issues.\n- **Position Adjustment:** Adjust positions dynamically based on available space.\n- **Error Handling:** Use try-except blocks to catch and handle placement errors gracefully.\n- **Visual Inspection:** Use the game interface to visually inspect the area for potential placement issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully place and connect all necessary components for your power setup.", "summary_range": "[1-328]"}
