{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (0,0)\nConsists of four furnaces for smelting iron:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n### Copper Smelting Area at (0,4)\nConsists of two furnaces for smelting copper:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n\n### Research Setup at (8.5, 0.5)\n- Lab containing 10 automation science packs\n- Currently not powered\n\n### Power Generation Setup at (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-9.5, 23.0)\n- Steam engine at (-9.5, 19.5)\nThe setup is currently not operational as components are not properly connected.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Related Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to insert into furnaces\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to place buildings\n\n### Crafting Related Errors\n- When crafting complex items like labs or science packs, ensure all prerequisite items and facilities are available\n- Some items (like copper plates) require specific crafting facilities (furnaces) and cannot be crafted directly\n\n### Building Placement Errors\n- Check terrain compatibility before placing buildings (especially near water)\n- Steam engines have specific placement requirements and cannot be placed on water tiles\n- Ensure sufficient clear space for larger buildings like steam engines (3x5 tiles)\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Power generation components (pump, boiler, steam engine) need proper connections to function\n- Ensure proper use of pipes to connect water-based buildings\n- Use appropriate connection methods between entities\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Building dimensions should be accessed directly rather than trying arithmetic operations on their attributes\n- Use appropriate data types when working with building dimensions and positions"}
