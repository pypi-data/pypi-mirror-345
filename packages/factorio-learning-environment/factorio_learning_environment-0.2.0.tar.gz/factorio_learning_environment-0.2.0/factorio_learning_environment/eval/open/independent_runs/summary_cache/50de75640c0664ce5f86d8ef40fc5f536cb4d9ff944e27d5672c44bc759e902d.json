Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\"\n\u2022 Drill Inserter at (-13.5, -47.5)\n\u2003\u2013 Configured with pickup at (-12.5, -47.5) and drop at (-14.5, -47.5).\n\u2022 Belt Network:\n\u2003- Remaining segments:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Transport Belt at (-15.5, -48.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Transport Belt at (-16.5, -48.5) with spacing=1.\n\u2003- BeltGroup Segment A:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Runs from (-16.5, -48.5) to (-16.5, -47.5) (comprising 6 belts).\n\u2003- BeltGroup Segment B2:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Connects (-15.5, -47.5) toward the smelting network input.\n\u2003- Output Extraction System:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 New Output Inserter at (-14.5, -47.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Initially placed with direction DOWN then rotated to Direction.UP; configured with pickup at (-14.5, -46.5) and drop at (-14.5, -48.5).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Sink Chest placed at (-14.5, -48.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013 Serves as the ore receptacle for the mining drill.\n\u2003- Note: Removal of the obstructing belt at (-14.5, -48.5) enabled output inserter and chest placement, though the mining drill continues to warn of a full chest at the drop position.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Output Inserter and Chest Placement Conflicts:\n\u2003\u2013 When placing a new output inserter, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. Failures with spacing=3 (collision with an existing wooden chest) and spacing=0 (collision with a transport belt) indicate the need to adjust spacing, direction, or reference position.\n\u2003\u2013 Likewise, errors when placing an output chest adjacent to the inserter (due to a nearby transport belt) call for checking occupancy before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Blocked Ore Output and Depot Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 A transport belt or residual items blocking the mining drill\u2019s drop position can prevent ore deposition. Ensure any obstructing belts are removed so the drill can deposit ore.\n\u2003\u2013 Absence of a proper sink entity results in output blockage. Place a valid chest (sink) at the drop position to accept ore.\n\u2003\u2013 Even after installing a sink chest, the warning \"chest at drop position is full\" may persist if the chest isn\u2019t cleared promptly. Regular extraction from the sink is essential to maintain smooth operation.\n\n\u2022 General Placement and Operation Considerations:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure the player is within the required proximity for placement actions.\n\u2003\u2013 Always verify that a target tile or zone is free of conflicting entities prior to placement to avoid downstream operational issues.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nshift_entity_local(entity: Entity, offset: Tuple[float, float]) -> Entity\n\u2003\u2022 Shifts the given entity\u2019s position locally by the specified offset.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Previously used successfully; note potential repositioning issues.\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 furnace_input_chest_pos (Position) \u2013 holds the position of the furnace\u2019s input chest.\n\u2022 current_player_inventory (Inventory) \u2013 tracks the player\u2019s inventory state."}
