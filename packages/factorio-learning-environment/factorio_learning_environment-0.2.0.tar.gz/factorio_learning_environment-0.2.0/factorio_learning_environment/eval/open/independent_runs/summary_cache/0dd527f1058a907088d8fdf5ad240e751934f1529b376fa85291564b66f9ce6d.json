Ensure you have all necessary sub-ingredients before attempting to craft.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities without having the items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items (e.g., coal) in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like burner mining drills.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without sufficient resources\n- Double-check the resource requirements for crafting items. For example, crafting a burner mining drill requires 5 stone, 3 iron plates, and 3 iron gear wheels. Gather all necessary resources before attempting to craft.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without ingredients\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel (e.g., coal) and smeltable ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to operate.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid positions\n- Ensure the target position is free of obstacles (e.g., water, other entities) before placing entities. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to other entities\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, ensure there is enough space and no collisions with nearby entities. Consider increasing spacing or changing the reference position.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities without fuel\n- Ensure the inserter has fuel (e.g., coal) to operate before attempting to transfer items.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills output is blocked\n- Ensure the mining drill has a valid destination (e.g., a chest or furnace) to output its resources. Place a sink entity (e.g., chest) at the drill's drop position if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities without available resources\n- Ensure the entity (e.g., burner mining drill) has resources available before attempting to extract items. Check the entity's status and inventory.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target position is not already occupied by another entity. Remove or relocate the existing entity if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n#### Errors when rotating inserters for proper item transfer\n- Ensure the inserter is facing the correct direction to transfer items between entities. Adjust the inserter's rotation if necessary."}
