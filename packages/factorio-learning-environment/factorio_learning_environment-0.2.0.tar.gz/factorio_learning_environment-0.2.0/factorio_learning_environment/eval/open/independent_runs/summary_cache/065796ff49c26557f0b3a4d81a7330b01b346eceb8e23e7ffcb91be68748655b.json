{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Line at y=0.0\nConsists of four stone furnaces in a row with partial automation:\n- Furnace at x=0.0 (no ingredients, contains 21 coal and 20 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=-1.5 y=0.5 for coal input from wooden chest at x=-2.5 y=0.5 (20 coal)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=0.5 y=-1.5 for ore input from wooden chest at x=0.5 y=-2.5 (empty)\n- Furnace at x=2.0 (no ingredients, contains 22 coal and 19 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=2.5 y=-1.5 for ore input from wooden chest at x=2.5 y=-2.5 (20 coal)\n  - Has output wooden chest at x=2.5 y=1.5 (empty)\n- Furnace at x=4.0 (no ingredients, contains 23 coal and 10 iron plates)\n- Furnace at x=6.0 (no ingredients, contains 23 coal and 10 iron plates)\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Entity placement collision errors\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces, account for the furnace's 2x2 tile size\n- Use appropriate spacing parameter when placing entities next to large structures\n- Check entity dimensions before attempting to place adjacent entities\n- When placing chests near furnaces, ensure there is enough space between existing structures\n- Increase spacing parameter when placing inserters if target position is occupied by another entity\n- Consider alternative directions when initial placement fails due to entity collisions\n- When placing inserters, check if the position is already occupied by another inserter or structure\n- When adding output inserters, verify the target position is not already occupied by chests or other furnaces\n\n### Resource gathering errors\n- Check if materials needed are raw resources (like wood) that must be gathered rather than crafted\n- Verify you have required items in inventory before attempting to place or insert\n- Consider harvesting more resources when inventory is depleted\n- Before crafting, check if required materials are raw resources that need gathering first\n\n### Furnace efficiency\n- Avoid placing furnaces without having resources ready to fuel and supply them\n- Set up furnaces one at a time, ensuring each is properly supplied before moving to the next one\n- When extracting products from furnaces, immediately resupply them with raw materials\n- Monitor furnace warnings like 'no ingredients to smelt' and address them promptly\n\n### Inserter setup errors\n- Ensure there is a valid destination entity for inserters before activating them\n- Verify inserter drop positions align with valid input slots on destination entities\n- Monitor inserter status - \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" indicates output blockage\n- When placing output inserters, ensure proper spacing and direction relative to the target chest\n- Check for existing inserters before attempting to place new ones in the same location\n\n### Automation design\n- When setting up automated input systems, ensure the complete input-output chain is configured\n- Consider setting up output collection systems alongside input automation\n- Test automation with small quantities before scaling up\n- When creating automation setups, ensure all required resources are available beforehand\n\n### Entity placement and retrieval errors\n- Verify that an entity exists at a position before attempting to interact with it\n- Double check coordinates when attempting to interact with entities\n- Before placing new entities, verify the target location is clear of other structures\n- Consider alternative positions or directions if initial placement fails due to collisions"}
