{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the chest and fueled with coal\n\nThis structure forms a basic iron plate mining and smelting line where iron ore is mined, smelted, and output collected in a chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter placement conflicts with existing entities\n- When placing an inserter adjacent to another entity (e.g., furnace), ensure the target tile is free and not occupied by another structure such as a chest.\n- Increase spacing, change direction, or adjust reference position when placing inserters next to other entities to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items due to no input in source container\n- Ensure the mining drill outputs iron ore into the furnace input slot properly.\n- Check that the furnace has iron ore available to smelt; if the drill inventory is empty, the inserter will wait indefinitely.\n- Verify that the output of the mining drill is not blocked by lack of a sink entity or full inventory.\n\n### Fuel management errors\n- Insert coal into burner mining drills, furnaces, and burner inserters to keep them operational.\n- Monitor fuel levels and ensure sufficient coal is inserted to prevent stoppage.\n\n### Output blocked warning on mining drill\n- The mining drill reports \"output blocked by item on the ground\" when there is no entity to accept mined ore.\n- Connect the drill output properly to the furnace input or provide a belt/inserter to transport mined ore.\n- Avoid leaving mined ore on the ground by ensuring a continuous item flow from drill to furnace.\n\n### Inventory insertion failure due to empty inventory\n- When inserting items (e.g., coal) from player inventory, confirm the inventory contains the required items before attempting insertion to avoid exceptions.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent yet."}
