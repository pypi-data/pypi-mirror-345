{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently working and has an inventory of copper-ore and copper-plate.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0) which is currently working and has an inventory of coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) which is currently normal and has an inventory of coal.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) which is currently waiting for source items and has an inventory of coal.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) which is currently waiting for space in destination and has an inventory of coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which is currently normal and has an inventory of iron-ore.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently working and has an inventory of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the target entity has enough space for the items you are trying to insert. If the entity is full or waiting for space, the insertion will fail.\n\n### Errors when using entities with no fuel\n- Check the fuel status of your entities before attempting to use them. If they are out of fuel, they will not operate.\n\n### Errors when placing items into a tile occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items into a furnace with no ingredients\n- Make sure the furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate before attempting to insert items. If it lacks ingredients, it will not function.\n\n### Errors when entities are waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source items are available and accessible to the inserters. If they are not, the inserters will remain in a waiting state.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper-ore`: int\n- `copper-plate`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int"}
