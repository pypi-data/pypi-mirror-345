{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbors: Wooden chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner inserter at (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (489 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Out of fuel warning\n  - Neighbors: Wooden chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner mining drill at (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Inventory: Iron plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is properly aligned and fueled to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the inserter setup to prevent the furnace from not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Regularly harvest coal to avoid running out of fuel, which can halt production.\n\n### Errors in Item Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, verify that you have the required items in your inventory. This will prevent errors such as attempting to insert coal when none is available."}
