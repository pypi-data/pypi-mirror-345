{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-10, -59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 3 Burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), (-6, -59)\n- 3 Wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\n- Mining drills are working on iron ore patches with 39997-40000 resources\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 4 Stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0)\n- Input system:\n  - 4 Wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5) holding coal and iron ore\n  - 4 Burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5) moving materials from chests to furnaces\n- Output system:\n  - 4 Wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5) for collecting iron plates\n  - 1 Burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) moving iron plates from furnace to output chest\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters in occupied spaces\n- Before placing inserters, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- When placing entities near furnaces, ensure proper spacing between the furnace and the inserter\n- Consider the tile dimensions of existing structures when calculating positions for new entities\n- If a position is occupied, try calculating an alternative position that maintains the desired functionality\n\n### Entity Placement Optimization\n- When building production lines, plan the layout to ensure sufficient space between components\n- Consider the working area needed by inserters when designing the layout\n- Leave appropriate gaps between structures to allow for inserter placement"}
