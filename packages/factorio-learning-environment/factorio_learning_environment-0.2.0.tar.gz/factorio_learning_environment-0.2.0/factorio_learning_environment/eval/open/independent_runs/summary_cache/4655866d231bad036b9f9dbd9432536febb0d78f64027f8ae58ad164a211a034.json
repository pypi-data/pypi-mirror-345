{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the above entities with positions ranging from (-9.5, 23.5) to (1.5, 24.5)\n\n### Laboratory Setup at Position (7.5, -61.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of 10 automation science packs, currently not researching\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions including (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5) for power distribution\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron and copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when setting research\n- Ensure the technology being set for research is available and correctly specified in the code.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the position and existence of entities before attempting to retrieve them. Ensure that the specified position is correct and the entity type exists at that location.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Ensure that all inserters and machines are connected to a power source. Check the connections and status of electric poles to ensure they are properly supplying power.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and other production entities have the necessary ingredients to operate. Regularly check inventories and supply chains to prevent production halts."}
