{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-6.625, 20.375)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe-group connections between:\n  - Offshore Pump and Boiler\n  - Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles at positions (-7.5, 18.5), (-7.5, 17.5), (-0.5, 17.5), and (-0.5, 19.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Currently has no ingredients, indicating it is not operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that you have enough pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. Craft or gather more pipes if necessary.\n- Verify that the path between entities is clear and that pipes are correctly aligned to connect the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and the Boiler to the Steam Engine.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in the Boiler to ensure it remains operational. Insert coal or other fuel types as needed to maintain functionality.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network Connection\n- Ensure that Small Electric Poles are placed correctly and within range to connect to the electricity network. Verify that all poles are plugged into the network to provide power to necessary structures.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Keep track of your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for crafting and placing entities. For example, ensure you have Small Electric Poles in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Index Errors in Code Execution\n- When accessing lists or arrays, ensure that the index used is within the valid range to avoid IndexError. Double-check the logic to prevent accessing elements that do not exist.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency and functionality of your structures can be significantly improved."}
