{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production at (1,1) and (3,1)\nTwo stone furnaces have been placed and are actively smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n- Stone furnace at position (1,1) containing 24 coal as fuel, 18 iron ore as input, and 3 iron plates as output\n- Stone furnace at position (3,1) containing 24 coal as fuel, 18 iron ore as input, and 3 iron plates as output\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Error when trying to craft items requiring assembly or smelting\n- Items like iron plates and iron gear wheels cannot be directly crafted in inventory\n- These items require either a furnace (for smelting ore into plates) or an assembling machine (for crafting intermediate products like iron gear wheels)\n- Ensure you have the appropriate production structure (furnace/assembling machine) before attempting to craft these items"}
