{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory contains 2 units of coal\n  - Energy: 2666.67 units\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Connected to a stone furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Resources: Contains 40,000 units of iron ore\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory contains 14 units of coal\n  - Energy: 1600.0 units\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Contains 60 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid positions\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and valid for placing entities such as Transport Belts, Wooden Chests, and Burner Inserters before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors related to entity interaction\n- When attempting to interact with entities, ensure that the entity exists at the specified position. For example, attempting to get a Stone Furnace at a position where it does not exist will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that the output of entities like Burner Mining Drills is not blocked by items on the ground. Place a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. If a furnace is in a \"No Ingredients\" status, supply it with the required materials to resume production."}
