{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (-15.0, -50.0)\nA mining and smelting setup for processing iron ore consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) facing down, mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -48.5) transferring items from drill to furnace \n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) for smelting iron ore into plates\n\nThe structure is fueled with coal and set up to automatically mine iron ore and smelt it into iron plates.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if the target position is already occupied by another entity before placing\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing to avoid overlap\n- Consider the entity dimensions (tile width/height) when calculating placement positions\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting to insert into entities\n- Keep track of fuel (coal) usage and ensure sufficient quantities for multiple entities\n\n### Errors with entity dimensions and calculations  \n- Cannot directly add entity WIDTH/HEIGHT properties - need to get the actual numeric values first\n- Use proper spacing calculations that account for entity dimensions when placing related entities\n\n### Errors with crafting requirements\n- Some items like iron plates can only be crafted in furnaces, not directly\n- Ensure all ingredient requirements are met before attempting to craft items\n- Check if required sub-ingredients need to be manufactured first"}
