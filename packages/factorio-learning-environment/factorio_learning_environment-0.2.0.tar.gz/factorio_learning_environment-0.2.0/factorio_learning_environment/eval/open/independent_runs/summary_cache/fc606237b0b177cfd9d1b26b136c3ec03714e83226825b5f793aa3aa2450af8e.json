{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with a working status, currently smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with no items currently stored.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to furnace operation**:\n  - Ensure that there are sufficient iron ore resources available before attempting to operate the furnace. The furnace cannot function without the required ingredients.\n  \n- **Errors when resetting furnace inventory**:\n  - Be cautious when resetting the furnace inventory as it may lead to loss of current operational status. Ensure that the inventory reset is necessary before executing it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus (e.g., EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS, EntityStatus.WORKING)\n  - `current_inventory`: Inventory (e.g., Inventory({'stone-furnace': 1, 'wood': 6, 'iron-plate': 46, 'copper-plate': 215, 'automation-science-pack': 62}))\n  - `final_inventory`: Inventory (e.g., Inventory({'iron-ore': 9}))"}
