{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\n### Extraction System Interface at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 An extraction system burner inserter located at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5) with a drop position at Position(x=-3.5, y=28.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position(x\u22482.5, y\u224817.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n\u2013 A factory burner inserter placed at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) using direction RIGHT\n\u2013 A secondary burner inserter inferred at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5) (as evidenced by neighbour links)\n\u2013 An assembling machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5) responsible for copper-cable production\n\n### Depot Belt Depot at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A wooden chest placed at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) serving as the belt depot\n\u2013 A transport belt segment positioned at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) adjacent to the depot chest\n\u2013 A depot burner inserter placed at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) (using direction UP) whose pickup position aligns with the depot target\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A steam engine (generator) at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)\n\u2013 A boiler at Position(x=-5.5, y=24.0)\n\u2013 An offshore pump at Position(x=-7.5, y=25.5)\nUsed to generate electricity; note that warnings indicate connectivity and input issues\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Errors:\n  \u2013 When attempting to connect transport belts, the target must be a valid inserter entity. Avoid using or misidentifying Prototype.SteamEngine objects as targets by ensuring an appropriate inserter is in place before initiating the belt connection.\n\n\u2022 Wooden Chest Placement Issues:\n  \u2013 If an error indicates that the target position is too far (e.g. distance exceeds the maximum allowed), move the player closer to the intended placement position.\n  \u2013 Before placing a wooden chest, verify that the inventory contains the required item to avoid placement failure.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Error:\n  \u2013 Ensure that variable names (such as \u2018target_chest\u2019) are correctly defined and used consistently throughout the code to prevent NameError exceptions."}
