Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity.\n  - Could not place pipe-to-ground at (12.5, 40.5) because there is an existing object in the way. Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity.\n  - Could not place pipe at (15.5, 40.5) because entity already exists at the target position. Remove the existing entity before continuing.\n  - Could not place pipe-to-ground at (14.5, 40.5) because entity already exists at the target position. Remove the existing entity before continuing.\n  - Could not place pipe at (13.5, 45.5) because there is an existing object in the way. Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity.\n* Errors when using undefined variables:\n  - NameError: name 'entity' is not defined. Ensure that all variables are defined before using them.\n  - NameError: name 'to' is not defined. Ensure that all variables are defined before using them.\n* Errors when using incorrect arguments:\n  - ValueError: The first argument must be an Entity or Prototype object. Ensure that the correct type of argument is passed to the function.\n* Tips:\n  - Ensure that the entity has the attribute or method you are trying to access.\n  - Check if the entity is valid and if the inventory can be inspected before attempting to inspect it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* No utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
