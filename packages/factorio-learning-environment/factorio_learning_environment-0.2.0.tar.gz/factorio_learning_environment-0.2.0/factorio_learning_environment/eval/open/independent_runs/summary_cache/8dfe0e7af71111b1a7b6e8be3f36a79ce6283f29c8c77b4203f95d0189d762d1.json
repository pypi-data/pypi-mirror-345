A 'Chest' object is not callable; verify the function and object usage to avoid TypeError.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory or destination\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations.\n- Ensure furnaces have ingredients to smelt and are not overloaded with fuel.\n\n### Errors due to out of fuel\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation."}
