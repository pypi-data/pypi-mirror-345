Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as 'radius') or incorrect positional arguments to match the function\u2019s signature.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Issues:\n  - Verify the availability of required items (for example, ensuring lab items are in inventory) before attempting placement.\n  - Ensure that any collection expected to be iterable is correctly initialized to avoid NoneType iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Shortages:\n  - Confirm that all prerequisite components (such as iron-gear-wheels, copper cables, and electronic circuits) are available before initiating lab crafting.\n  - Implement checks in the resource supply chain to address missing sub-ingredients and to guarantee sufficient inputs for complex recipes."}
