{"content": "The attempt to load stone into the active furnace has yielded the following results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace currently holds **3 pieces of stone** after the attempted insertion of **5 pieces**.\n- The furnace is now marked as **\"WORKING,\"** indicating that it is operational, but it is still not processing any materials (specifically, Copper Ore).\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore**\n  - **1 piece of copper ore available.**\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates available.**\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace recognizes only **3 pieces of stone**, which is still insufficient for processing the Copper Ore. The expected behavior would be for the furnace to accept all **5 pieces** of stone.\n- The furnace has **6 pieces of coal** as fuel, confirming it is powered but continues to not process any materials.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract the Remaining Stone**: I will extract the **3 pieces of stone** currently present in the furnace to reset its state.\n2. **Retry Loading the Stone**: After clearing the furnace, I will attempt to load **2 pieces of stone** back into it along with the **1 piece of Copper Ore.**\n3. **Monitor for Successful Smelting Operation**: I will check if the furnace can now properly process the Copper Ore.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the remaining stone from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the remaining stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Extract the 3 pieces of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-426]"}
