{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nThis facility is designed to extract iron ore and process it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is responsible for transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace. It is aligned and repositioned to ensure proper transfer.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it is currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the setup if the furnace is not receiving materials.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fuel\n- Keep the inserter refueled with coal to maintain its operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Verify that the necessary resources (like coal) are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines or entities. This will prevent errors related to insufficient resources.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Check that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to function. Adjust the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving materials as expected."}
