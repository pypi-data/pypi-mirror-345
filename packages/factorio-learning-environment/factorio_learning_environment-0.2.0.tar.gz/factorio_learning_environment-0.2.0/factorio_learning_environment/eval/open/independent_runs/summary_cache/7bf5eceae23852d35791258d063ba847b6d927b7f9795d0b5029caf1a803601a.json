{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5) - connected to pipe network 9040 (water)\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=0.0) - contains 27 coal, connected to pipe network 9040\n- Pipe-to-ground connection (x=-6.5, y=-1.5) - disconnected\n- Additional boiler (x=-6.5, y=10.0) - contains 7 coal, connected to pipe network 9046\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=9.5) - connected to pipe network 9046 (water)\n- New offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - not properly connected\n- Pipe networks:\n  - System 9040: water transport between x=-8.5 to x=-7.5\n  - System 9046: water transport between x=-8.5 to x=-8.5\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - operational but no power\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - no power, configured for basic oil processing\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - operational\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - misconfigured (drops to ground), no power\n- Wooden chest (x=37.5, y=37.5) - empty\n- Connected pipe networks:\n  - System 9067: petroleum gas transport\n  - System 9068: crude oil transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent fluid connection issues\n- Failed connections between offshore pumps and boilers (steps 106, 110, 111)\n- Blocked refinery to storage tank connection (step 104)\n- Empty source connection attempts (step 105)\n  - Verify fluid presence before connecting\n  - Ensure clear path between connection points\n  - Check fluid types match between connected entities\n\n### Power system failures\n- Steam engine not producing power (step 107)\n- Missing boiler entity (step 109)\n  - Verify all power generation components exist\n  - Check fuel supply to boilers\n  - Ensure proper steam engine connections\n\n### Inventory management problems\n- Missing offshore pumps when needed (step 108)\n- Insufficient coal supply (steps 96, 99, 103)\n  - Verify inventory before operations\n  - Maintain adequate stock of critical components\n\n### Entity access errors\n- Attempting to access non-existent entities (steps 97, 102, 109)\n  - Verify entity existence before interaction\n  - Check positions carefully when referencing entities\n\n### Recommended actions:\n1. Fix all fluid connections with proper alignment\n2. Verify and repair power generation system\n3. Maintain adequate inventory of critical components\n4. Validate entity existence before interaction\n5. Ensure proper fluid presence before connecting systems"}
