{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is working and connected to the boiler, which is also operational.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) that is currently full output and processing copper-ore into iron-plate.\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) that is set to create automation-science-pack but has a shortage of ingredients (copper-plate and iron-gear-wheel).\n\n### Pipe groups\n- PipeGroup for steam (fluid system 40059) connecting the boiler and steam engine.\n- PipeGroup for water (fluid system 40062) connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Electricity distribution\nConsists of multiple small electric poles providing power to various structures, including the lab and assembling machine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when setting recipes for furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace is placed correctly and is operational before attempting to set its recipe. Verify that the furnace exists at the specified position.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
