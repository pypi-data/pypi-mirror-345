The agent made several attempts to place a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but all placement efforts failed due to missing inventory items and incomplete resource chains. Although references were made to a furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for smelting iron plates and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production, these were retrieved for processing and do not represent new constructions initiated by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval:\n  \u2013 When invoking get_entities, use only the supported parameters. Avoid including unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect count of positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Null Iteration Handling:\n  \u2013 Always check that functions returning lists of entities do not yield None before iterating. Use a fallback (for example, an empty list) to safely process results.\n\n\u2022 Structure Placement Verification:\n  \u2013 Ensure that the required item (e.g., Lab) is available in the inventory before attempting placement. Confirm that the target tile is valid and unoccupied to prevent placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Prerequisite Management:\n  \u2013 Verify that all necessary sub-ingredients for complex items, such as Labs, are available. Address shortages in components like iron-gear-wheels, copper-cables, and electronic-circuits by managing upstream production steps effectively."}
