{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The drill is currently working but has a warning indicating the output is blocked by an item on the ground. It has a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt and is currently not producing due to lack of input materials. It has a furnace result inventory containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and valid for placing the desired entity before attempting placement. This includes checking for existing entities or items on the ground that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the destination tile is suitable for the entity being moved. Ensure there are no obstructions or mismatches in tile dimensions that could prevent successful placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the expected entity type at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This includes verifying the entity type and ensuring it exists at the desired location.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity or appropriate infrastructure to accept the output from production entities like drills or furnaces. This can involve placing chests, belts, or inserters to facilitate the flow of materials.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in production\n- Check that all necessary ingredients are available and supplied to production entities like furnaces to prevent production halts. This may involve ensuring a steady supply of raw materials through belts or inserters."}
