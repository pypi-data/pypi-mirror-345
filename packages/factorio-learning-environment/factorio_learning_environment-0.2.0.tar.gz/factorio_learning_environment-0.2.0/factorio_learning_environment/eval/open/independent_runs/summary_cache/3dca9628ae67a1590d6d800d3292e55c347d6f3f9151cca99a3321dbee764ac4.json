{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures created by the agent on the map. The logs indicate that all attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in an empty map with no structures or entities placed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Ensure the target tile is clear before placing an entity:** The agent repeatedly attempted to place entities like Wooden Chests and Stone Furnaces at various positions (e.g., x=0.0 y=10.0, x=10.0 y=0.0, x=-100.0 y=100.0, x=20.0 y=20.0, x=50.0 y=50.0, x=51.5 y=-82.0) but failed. Verify that the target tile is not occupied or blocked before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors related to position checks\n- **Verify positions are clear for placement:** The agent encountered multiple errors indicating that positions (e.g., x=-0.5 y=-0.5, x=0.5 y=0.5, x=1.5 y=1.5) are not clear for placement. Ensure that the positions are checked and confirmed to be clear before attempting to place entities."}
