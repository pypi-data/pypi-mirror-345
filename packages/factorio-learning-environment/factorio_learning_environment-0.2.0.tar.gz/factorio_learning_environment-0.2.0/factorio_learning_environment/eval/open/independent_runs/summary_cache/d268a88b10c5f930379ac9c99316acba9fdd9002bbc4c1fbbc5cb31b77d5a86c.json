The warning indicates that the furnace result is full.\n  \n- **Errors when the wooden chest is full**\n  - The mining drill cannot continue if the chest at the drop position is full. Empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to allow the mining drill to continue working.\n\n- **Errors when extracting coal from the wooden chest**\n  - Ensure that the wooden chest has enough coal before attempting to extract. The inventory shows a decrease in coal, so monitor the chest's inventory closely.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined:**\n  - None reported.\n\n- **Variables Assigned:**\n  - `wood`: int (6)\n  - `coal`: int (1705)\n  - `iron-ore`: int (53)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (457)"}
