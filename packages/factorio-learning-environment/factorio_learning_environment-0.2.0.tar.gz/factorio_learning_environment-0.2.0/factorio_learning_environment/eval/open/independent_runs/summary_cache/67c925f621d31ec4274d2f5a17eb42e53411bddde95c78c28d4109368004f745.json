The maximum distance to place an entity is 10 units.\n* **Errors when connecting belts**: Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with belts are compatible and that there are no obstacles blocking the path.\n* **Errors when placing entities next to other entities**: Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position when placing entities next to other entities to avoid collisions.\n* **Errors when using connect_entities function**: Check that the entities you are trying to connect have the correct attributes and that the path is valid.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* **Utility functions**:\n\t+ `place_entity`: Places an entity at a specified position.\n\t+ `connect_entities`: Connects two entities with a belt.\n\t+ `place_entity_next_to`: Places an entity next to another entity.\n* **Important variables**:\n\t+ `drill`: A burner mining drill entity.\n\t+ `inserter`: A burner inserter entity.\n\t+ `furnace`: A stone furnace entity.\n\t+ `chest`: A wooden chest entity.\n\t+ `belt_group`: A belt group entity.\n\t+ `coal_patch_position`: The position of a coal patch.\n\t+ `transport_belt`: A transport belt entity."}
