{"content": "It seems that the function `ensure_craftable` is not defined in the current context, which is causing an error when I attempt to use it to craft small electric poles. \n\nTo proceed, I will manually check my inventory for the required materials to craft the small electric poles and then craft them directly.\n\n### Required Materials for Small Electric Pole:\n- 1 wood\n- 1 iron plate\n\n### Current Inventory:\n- 8 wood\n- 3 iron plates\n\nSince I have enough wood and iron plates, I can craft the small electric poles directly. Each pole requires 1 wood and 1 iron plate, so I can craft up to 3 poles.\n\n### Crafting Small Electric Poles\n1. Craft 3 small electric poles.\n2. Place the electric poles near the assembling machine to provide power.\n\nLet's proceed with crafting the small electric poles directly:\n\n```python\n# Crafting small electric poles directly\ncraft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)  # Crafting 1\ncraft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)  # Crafting 2\ncraft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)  # Crafting 3\n```\n\nAfter crafting the poles, I will check my inventory to confirm the changes and then place the electric poles to connect the assembling machine to the power network. \n\n### Check Inventory After Crafting\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting electric poles: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n### Place Electric Poles\nNow, I will find a suitable position to place the electric poles and connect them to the assembling machine. \n\n```python\n# Find a suitable position for the electric pole\nelectric_pole_position = nearest_buildable(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\n\n# Place the small electric pole\nplace_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=electric_pole_position)\n```\n\n### Check Entities on the Map\nFinally, I will check the status of the electric pole and the assembling machine to ensure they are connected properly.\n\n```python\n# Check the status of entities on the map\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after placing the electric pole: {get_entities()}\")\n``` \n\nLet\u2019s execute these steps to ensure the assembling machine is powered and ready to operate.", "summary_range": "[1-96]"}
