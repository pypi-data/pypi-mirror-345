{"content": "```\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Insufficient Resources\n- The agent attempts to craft or build items without having enough resources in its inventory. Ensure sufficient resources are available before attempting to craft or build. For example, the agent attempts to craft when it does not have enough iron ore or wooden chests in inventory.\n\n### Inserter Blocked\n- The agent places a transport belt that blocks an inserter. Ensure that inserters are not blocked by other entities, such as transport belts, when placing them. The inserters at (40.5, -80.5), (6.5, -57.5) and (8.5, -57.5) are blocked.\n\n### Harvesting Error\n- The agent attempts to harvest wood but encounters an error related to string indices. This suggests an issue with how the harvesting function is being called or how the target entity is being identified. Review the harvesting logic and ensure that the target entity is correctly identified and that the function is called with the correct arguments.\n\n### Inserter Already Has Fuel\n- The agent attempts to insert fuel into an inserter that already has fuel. Check the inserter's inventory before attempting to insert fuel to avoid this error.\n\n### Transport Belt Missing\n- The agent attempts to interact with a transport belt that is no longer present at the expected location. Verify that the transport belt exists at the expected location before attempting to interact with it.\n\nNAMESPACE\n```"}
