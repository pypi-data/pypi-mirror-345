{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The logs indicate that no entities have been successfully placed, and the map remains empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Non-Buildable Positions\n- Ensure that the positions where you attempt to place entities are buildable. The logs indicate multiple attempts to place entities such as Stone Furnaces and Wooden Chests at positions that are not buildable (e.g., x=21.0 y=21.0, x=25.0 y=25.0, etc.). Verify the buildability of a position before placing an entity.\n\n### Errors with Occupied or Invalid Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target tile is not occupied or invalid for the entity type. Attempts to place Wooden Chests and Transport Belts at various positions (e.g., x=0.0 y=0.0, x=40.5 y=-82.5) have failed, indicating potential tile occupation or invalidity.\n\n### Errors with Resource Supply\n- Ensure that the necessary resources are available and supplied to entities that require them. Logs show errors related to the lack of coal supply to a Stone Furnace, which suggests checking resource availability and supply lines before placing or using entities.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Double-check environmental settings and restrictions that might affect placement. The logs mention checking for global build restrictions and environmental settings, which could impact where and how entities can be placed.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in building and managing structures within the game environment."}
