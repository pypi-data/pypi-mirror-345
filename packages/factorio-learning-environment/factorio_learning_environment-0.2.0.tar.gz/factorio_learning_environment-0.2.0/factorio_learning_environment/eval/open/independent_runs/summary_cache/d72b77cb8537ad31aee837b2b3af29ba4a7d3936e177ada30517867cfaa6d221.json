{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Currently disconnected from power network (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Power Generation Plant at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-6.0, 1.5) heated by coal\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 4.5) generating electricity\n- Connected pipe network for water/steam transfer\n- Currently producing 30 steam/second\n\n### New Smelting Setup at (16.0, 73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (16.0, 73.0)\n- Currently missing:\n  - Fuel supply (status: NO_FUEL)\n  - Input inserter configuration\n  - Output chest/inserter setup\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues\n- Repeated attempts to place inserters/chests in occupied positions\n- Solution: Always check target position is clear before placing entities\n- Use remove_entity() on existing objects before replacement\n\n### Smelting Setup Problems\n- Furnace placement issues:\n  - Missing fuel supply (add coal manually or via inserter)\n  - No configured input/output paths\n- Solution: Complete the smelting chain:\n  1. Place input inserter from mining drill to furnace\n  2. Place output chest with inserter from furnace\n  3. Ensure all components are properly aligned\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Mining drill remains unpowered despite available electricity\n- Solution: Connect small electric pole between power plant and mining operation\n- Verify power network covers all production buildings\n\n### Inserter Configuration\n- Continuing issues with proper inserter placement/orientation\n- Remember:\n  - Inserters must bridge exactly between source and target\n  - Leave 0.5 tile spacing between entities\n  - Verify pickup/drop positions match entity interfaces\n\n### Entity Spacing Problems\n- Multiple placement failures due to insufficient space\n- Factorio requires:\n  - Minimum 0.5 tile clearance around all entities\n  - Larger machines (like furnaces) need 1+ tile buffers\n- Plan layouts with adequate spacing before placement\n\n### Production Monitoring\n- Current throughput shows basic production but no plate output\n- Regularly check:\n  - Power status of all electric devices\n  - Fuel levels in burner devices\n  - Input/output flow of materials"}
