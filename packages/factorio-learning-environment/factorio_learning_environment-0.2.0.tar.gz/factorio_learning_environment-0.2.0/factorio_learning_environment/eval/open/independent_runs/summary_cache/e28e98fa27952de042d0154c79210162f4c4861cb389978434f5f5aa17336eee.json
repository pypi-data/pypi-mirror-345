{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler (position -5.0, 2.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine (position 0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected with pipes forming two pipe groups (water and steam systems)\n- Small electric pole (position 3.5, 6.5) connecting to power network\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position 15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest (position 15.5, 72.5) collecting iron ore (currently contains 8 ore)\n- Burner inserter (position 15.5, 73.5) with coal fuel, transferring items between chest and furnace\n- Stone furnace (position 16.0, 75.0) with coal fuel\n- Wooden chest (position 17.5, 75.5) for plate output (currently empty)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement errors due to occupied tiles\n- Always check if target position is clear before placing entities\n- Remove existing entities before attempting to place new ones in the same location\n- The agent attempted to place entities at occupied positions multiple times (furnace at (15.5,74.5), wooden chest at (15.5,75.5) and (16.5,75.5), burner inserter at (16.5,75.0))\n\n### Incorrect belt connections\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces - use inserters instead\n- The agent attempted to directly connect a mining drill to a furnace with belts, which is not possible\n\n### Inserter placement issues\n- Ensure there is space around furnaces for inserters to operate\n- The agent had difficulty placing inserters near the furnace due to space constraints\n\n### Mining operation warnings\n- Empty output chests regularly to prevent mining drills from stopping (current warning on iron drill)\n- The iron mining drill has stopped due to full output chest at (15.5,72.5)\n\n### Furnace operation issues\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and input materials to operate\n- The stone furnace currently has no ingredients to smelt despite having fuel"}
