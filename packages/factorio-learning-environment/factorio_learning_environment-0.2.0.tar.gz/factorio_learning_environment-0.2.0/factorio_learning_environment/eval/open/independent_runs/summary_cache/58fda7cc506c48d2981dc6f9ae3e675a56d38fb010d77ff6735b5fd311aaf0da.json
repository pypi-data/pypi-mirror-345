{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is currently mining coal.\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) that is used to store the extracted coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently fueled with coal but has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when the Wooden Chest is full**: The agent received warnings indicating that the chest at (41.5, -80.5) is full. To avoid this, regularly check and empty the chest to ensure continuous mining operations.\n- **Errors when inserting fuel into the Furnace with no ingredients**: The Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) reported 'no ingredients to smelt'. Ensure that there are raw materials available for smelting before fueling the furnace.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `wooden-chest`: object\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: object\n  - `stone-furnace`: object"}
