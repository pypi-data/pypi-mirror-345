{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) with ingredients: {'iron-plate': 80}\n- Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0) with ingredients: {'iron-plate': 92}\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=62.5, y=-53.5) waiting for source items\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=65.5, y=-52.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) storing {'stone-brick': 10, 'wood': 6, 'coal': 5, 'stone': 5}\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), actively mining coal\n- Wooden chests at positions:\n  - (x=40.5, y=-83.5) with inventory: {'coal': 638}\n  - (x=43.5, y=-83.5) with inventory: {'coal': 450}\n  - (x=42.5, y=-83.5) with empty inventory\n  - (x=44.5, y=-83.5) with inventory: {'coal': 411}\n  - (x=41.5, y=-84.5) with inventory: {'coal': 300, 'iron-gear-wheel': 1000}\n  - (x=40.5, y=-84.5) with inventory: {'coal': 550, 'iron-plate': 500}\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups connecting various entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting inputs from (x=45.5, y=-82.5) to outputs at (x=67.5, y=-54.5) with 70 belts\n- BeltGroup connecting inputs from (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to outputs at (x=63.5, y=-50.5) with 51 belts\n- BeltGroup connecting inputs from (x=42.5, y=-81.5) to outputs at (x=65.5, y=-46.5) with 67 belts\n- BeltGroup connecting inputs from (x=44.5, y=-81.5) to outputs at (x=65.5, y=-54.5) with 49 belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure that the path for connecting belts is valid and clear of obstructions. Attempting to connect belts where there is no valid path will result in failure.\n- Before attempting to connect belts, verify that the starting and ending positions are accessible and not blocked by other entities.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Monitor inventory levels to prevent overfilling. Attempting to insert items into a full inventory will fail.\n- Consider placing additional storage chests if inventory space is consistently an issue.\n\n### Errors when Inventory is Full\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to pick up items. If the inventory is full, items cannot be picked up.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the number of various items the agent has, e.g., {'transport-belt': 16, 'burner-inserter': 80, 'coal': 1936, 'iron-ore': 57, 'iron-plate': 60, 'iron-gear-wheel': 588}.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the current structures and errors encountered by the agent, along with actionable tips to improve operations."}
