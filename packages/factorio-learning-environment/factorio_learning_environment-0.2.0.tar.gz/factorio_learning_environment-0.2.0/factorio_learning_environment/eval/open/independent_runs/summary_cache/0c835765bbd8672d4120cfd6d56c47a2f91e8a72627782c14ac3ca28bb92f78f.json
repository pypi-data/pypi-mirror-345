Adjust spacing or change placement direction to secure a valid spot.\n\n\u2022 Source Position Availability:\n  - Confirm that the computed drop position from burner inserters is unoccupied by neighboring entities (for example, interference from an AssemblingMachine can block a valid source). Use re-computation or offset strategies if conflicts are detected.\n\n\u2022 Belt Path Normalisation:\n  - Precompute and validate intermediate waypoints to establish continuous, valid belt paths. Ensure that manual overrides and updated waypoints do not produce unreachable routes that trigger \u201cNot a valid path to normalise\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Variable and API Usage:\n  - Ensure that all required variables (such as those for retrieving inserter drop positions) are properly defined and referenced to prevent NameErrors and TypeErrors during API calls.\n\n"}
