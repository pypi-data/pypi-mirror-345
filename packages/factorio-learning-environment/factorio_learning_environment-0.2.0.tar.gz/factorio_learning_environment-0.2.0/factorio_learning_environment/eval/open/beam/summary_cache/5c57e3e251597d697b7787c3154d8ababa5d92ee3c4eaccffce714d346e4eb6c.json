Here\u2019s the plan:\n\n1. **Craft a Stone Furnace**: This will allow us to smelt ores into plates later on.\n2. **Craft a Burner Mining Drill**: This will enable us to automate the collection of resources.\n\n### Steps to Follow:\n\n1. **Check and Ensure Crafting Materials**: \n   - We need to ensure we have enough materials to craft a Stone Furnace and a Burner Mining Drill.\n   - The Stone Furnace requires 5 stone.\n   - The Burner Mining Drill requires 3 iron plates and 1 stone.\n\n2. **Craft the Stone Furnace**:\n   - Since we have enough stone, we can proceed to craft the Stone Furnace.\n\n3. **Craft the Burner Mining Drill**:\n   - We need to smelt some iron ore into iron plates before we can craft the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Execution:\n\n1. **Craft the Stone Furnace**:\n   - Check if we can craft the Stone Furnace.\n   - If we can, proceed to craft it.\n\n2. **Smelt Iron Ore into Iron Plates**:\n   - First, we need to gather some iron ore.\n   - Then, we will smelt the iron ore into iron plates using the Stone Furnace.\n\n3. **Craft the Burner Mining Drill**:\n   - Once we have the iron plates, we can craft the Burner Mining Drill.\n\nLet's start by crafting the Stone Furnace. If we have enough materials, we can proceed.", "summary_range": "[1-4]"}
