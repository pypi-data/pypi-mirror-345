This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that inserters have access to the required source items. This will avoid warnings like \"inserter waiting for source items.\"\n\n### Errors with furnaces reaching full output\n- Regularly clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from reaching a full output status, which can halt production."}
