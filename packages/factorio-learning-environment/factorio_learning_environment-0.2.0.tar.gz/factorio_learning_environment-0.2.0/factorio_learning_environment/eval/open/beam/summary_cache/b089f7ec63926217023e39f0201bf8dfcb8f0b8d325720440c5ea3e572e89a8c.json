{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel (7 coal) and currently smelting iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (61.0, -54.0)) with fuel (3 coal) and operational status.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (60.5, -55.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (60.5, -55.5)) containing 12 units of stone.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to crafting items\n- Ensure you have all required resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, you encountered an error when trying to craft iron gear wheels and burner mining drills due to insufficient iron plates.\n- Check that you have gathered enough raw materials (like stone) needed for crafting sub-ingredients (like stone furnaces).\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before trying to insert them into entities. For example, you encountered an error when attempting to insert coal into the burner mining drill without having coal available.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft with insufficient resources\n- Always verify your current inventory and available resources before trying to craft items to avoid \"Not enough resources\" errors.\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables\n- Make sure all variables are properly defined before use, as seen with the error regarding 'gear_wheel_ingredients' not being defined.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect data types\n- Ensure that the data types used in your code are correct. For example, avoid using strings where objects are expected, which led to the AttributeError regarding 'str' objects.\n\n### Errors when smelting timeout occurs\n- Ensure that the furnace has both fuel and the required input items to prevent smelting timeouts.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. You encountered an error when trying to place a wooden chest without having it in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the required items. You encountered errors when attempting to extract stone from the wooden chest, which had no stone available."}
