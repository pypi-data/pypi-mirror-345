{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron and Copper Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Currently contains 3 units of coal as fuel.\n  - Furnace result inventory includes 4 copper plates.\n  - Warnings indicate no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have the required resources before attempting to craft items. For instance, crafting a furnace requires stone, and crafting an inserter requires sub-ingredients like electronic circuits and copper plates.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Furnace\n- Verify that the furnace contains the desired items before attempting extraction. Multiple errors occurred when trying to extract iron plates and copper plates from a furnace that did not contain the specified quantity.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Sub-Ingredients\n- When crafting complex items, ensure all sub-ingredients are available. For example, crafting an inserter failed due to missing electronic circuits, which in turn required copper cables and copper plates. Ensure you have the necessary crafting machines or furnaces to produce these sub-ingredients."}
