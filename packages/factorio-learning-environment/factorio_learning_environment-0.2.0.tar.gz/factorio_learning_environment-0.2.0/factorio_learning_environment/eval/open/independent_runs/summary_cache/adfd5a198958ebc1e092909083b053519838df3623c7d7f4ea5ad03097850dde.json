{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 21.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) with status: WORKING\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status: WORKING\n- Pipe group at position (-12.5, 21.5) with status: WORKING\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in obstructed positions\n- Ensure the target position is clear of obstructions before attempting to place entities such as steam engines, boilers, offshore pumps, and electric poles.\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles\n- Verify that electric poles are placed correctly and within range to connect them effectively. Ensure there are no obstructions preventing their placement.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect use of pickup_entity API\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that if the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None. Conversely, if the first argument is not an Entity object, provide a valid Position object as the second argument.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available before attempting to operate entities such as stone furnaces.\n\n### Errors when entities are not connected\n- Ensure that all components, such as boilers and offshore pumps, are correctly connected to the necessary networks to function properly."}
