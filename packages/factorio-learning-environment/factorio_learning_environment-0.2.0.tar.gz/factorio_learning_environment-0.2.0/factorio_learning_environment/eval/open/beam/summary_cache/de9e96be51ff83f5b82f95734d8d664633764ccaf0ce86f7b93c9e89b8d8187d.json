{"content": "Great! You've successfully extracted the iron plates and crafted the Offshore Pump. Now, let's proceed with setting up the power infrastructure to get your Assembling Machine running.\n\n### Steps to Set Up Power Infrastructure:\n\n1. **Place the Boiler:**\n   - Position the Boiler next to the Offshore Pump to start generating steam.\n   - Ensure the Boiler is connected to the Offshore Pump's water output.\n\n2. **Insert Fuel into the Boiler:**\n   - Insert coal into the Boiler to start generating steam.\n\n3. **Place the Steam Engine:**\n   - Connect the Steam Engine to the Boiler to convert steam into electricity.\n\n4. **Connect the Steam Engine to the Power Grid:**\n   - Use Small Electric Poles to connect the Steam Engine to the Assembling Machine.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Place the Boiler next to the Offshore Pump\nboiler_position = offshore_pump.position.right()  # Adjust based on map layout\nboiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\nassert boiler, \"Failed to place Boiler.\"\n\n# Step 2: Insert coal into the Boiler\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=5)\n\n# Step 3: Place the Steam Engine next to the Boiler\nsteam_engine_position = boiler.position.right()  # Adjust based on map layout\nsteam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=steam_engine_position)\nassert steam_engine, \"Failed to place Steam Engine.\"\n\n# Step 4: Connect the Steam Engine to the Assembling Machine using Electric Poles\nassembling_machine_position = nearest(Prototype.AssemblingMachine1)\nconnect_entities(steam_engine, assembling_machine_position)\n\n# Verify the power setup\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after setting up power: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- Ensure that the Boiler is correctly aligned with the Offshore Pump to receive water.\n- Make sure the Steam Engine is properly connected to the Boiler to receive steam.\n- Use Small Electric Poles to bridge the gap between the Steam Engine and the Assembling Machine, ensuring they are within range.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to power your Assembling Machine and continue with your production tasks.", "summary_range": "[1-160]"}
