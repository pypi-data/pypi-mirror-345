# gasdiff

Takes in the path of two Forge gas reports in JSON format, and prints out a gas diff report in Markdown format.
Forge JSON gas reports can be generated by running `forge test --gas-report --json`.
We also recommend passing `--fuzz-seed 0` so that fuzzy tests receive the same fuzzy parameters before and after changes in the source code.

## Usage

```bash
python -m gasdiff before.json after.json
```

## Example

Please consult the `examples` directory.
