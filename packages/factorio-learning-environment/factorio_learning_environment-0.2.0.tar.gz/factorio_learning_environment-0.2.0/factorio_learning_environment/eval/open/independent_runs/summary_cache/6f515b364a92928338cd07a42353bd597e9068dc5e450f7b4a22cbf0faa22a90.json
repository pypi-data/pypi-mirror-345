{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with output blocked, waiting for space in destination.\n- Transport Belts forming a network connecting the mining drill to various positions, including (x=41.5, y=-85.5), (x=41.5, y=-84.5), (x=41.5, y=-83.5), and (x=41.5, y=-82.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-81.5) which is empty.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing 66 iron plates.\n\n### Belt Networks\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5) and outputs from (x=49.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5), carrying coal.\n- Several other BeltGroups with various configurations, primarily empty, connecting different parts of the system.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-81.5) and Iron Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-80.5).\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5), both waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Functionality\n- Ensure that inserters are properly aligned with the source and destination entities to avoid waiting for source items or having empty chests.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockage\n- Make sure there is an appropriate sink entity or storage space for the output of mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with Ingredient Supply\n- Verify that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process to avoid idle status due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### General Placement and Connectivity Errors\n- Check that all belt networks are correctly connected and aligned to ensure smooth transport of materials across the system."}
