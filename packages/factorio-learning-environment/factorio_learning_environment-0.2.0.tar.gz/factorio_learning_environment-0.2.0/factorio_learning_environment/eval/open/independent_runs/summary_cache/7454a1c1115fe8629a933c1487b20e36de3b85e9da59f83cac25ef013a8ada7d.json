{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of three stone furnaces in a row:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 3 at position (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are actively smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Production Line\nLocated around position (9.5, 11.5), consists of:\n- Wooden chest at (6.5, 11.5) storing iron plates\n- Burner inserter at (7.5, 11.5) moving items from input chest to assembler\n- Assembling machine at (9.5, 11.5) crafting copper cables\n- Burner inserter at (11.5, 11.5) moving items from assembler to output\n- Storage chest at (12.5, 11.5) containing mixed resources\n- Additional storage chests at (14.5, 11.5) and (16.5, 11.5)\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around y-position 24.5, consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 24.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting power to the factory\n\n### Research Lab Setup\nLocated at the bottom of the factory:\n- Lab with automation and logistic science packs\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 30.5) feeding the lab\n- Storage chest at (0.5, 31.5) containing science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Ensure boiler has constant fuel supply to prevent \"out of fuel\" warnings\n- Steam engine shows \"not connected to power network\" - verify electrical connections\n\n### Assembly Machine Issues\n- Cannot extract items from assembling machine when production hasn't completed\n- Ensure required input materials are available before attempting production\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels to prevent \"No coal to insert\" errors\n- Clear blocked items from ground regularly to prevent item buildup\n\n### Production Flow\n- Verify chest capacity before attempting to store more items (chest full warnings observed)\n- Ensure proper power supply to all electrical components"}
