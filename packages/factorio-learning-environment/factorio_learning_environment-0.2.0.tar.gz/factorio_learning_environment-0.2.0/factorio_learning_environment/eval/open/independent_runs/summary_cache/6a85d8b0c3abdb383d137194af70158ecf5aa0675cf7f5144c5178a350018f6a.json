{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, y=-58.5) and (5.5, y=-60.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0), each fueled with coal, used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), and (-8.5, y=-50.5), each storing iron plates and marked with a warning indicating they are full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, y=-50.5) storing a smaller quantity of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in mining operations. The chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) is full, halting the mining drill's operation.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to smelt. The furnaces at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) are currently without ingredients to smelt.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current log.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count`: int, tracks the amount of iron ore in storage.\n- `iron_plate_count`: int, tracks the amount of iron plates in storage.\n- `coal_count`: int, tracks the amount of coal available for fueling entities."}
