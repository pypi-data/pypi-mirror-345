{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0), which is currently out of fuel and has a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5). It is extracting iron ore from a resource field containing 40,000 units.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0), which has coal as fuel and is currently out of ingredients to smelt. It has a furnace result inventory containing 60 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Moving or Placing Entities\n- Ensure that the target location for moving or placing entities is not already occupied by another entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot move the Stone Furnace to the new location\" or \"Cannot place Transport Belt at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when Retrieving Entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will avoid errors like \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.5 y=-52.5.\"\n\n### Errors when Placing Items at Drill's Drop Position\n- Make sure the drill's drop position is clear before placing items like a Wooden Chest. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the drill's drop position.\"\n\n### Errors when Placing Burner Inserters\n- Confirm that the desired location for placing a Burner Inserter is valid and unoccupied. This will prevent errors like \"Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location.\"\n\n### Fuel and Ingredient Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the Burner Mining Drill to avoid warnings such as \"out of fuel.\"\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to prevent warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\""}
