{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, fueled by coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-13.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -46.5) for transferring resources between entities.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** for storing iron plates at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -46.5) and (-7.5, -47.5) for storing and transferring iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-8.5, -47.5) and (-11.5, -45.5) for moving iron plates between storage and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Drop Position Blockage\n- Ensure that the drop position of inserters is clear before attempting to transfer items. Regularly check and clear any blockages to maintain smooth operation.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Furnace\n- Verify that the furnace has the required items available before attempting extraction. Ensure that the extraction command specifies the correct quantity and target entity.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Regularly supply the source with necessary items to prevent idle inserters.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
