{"content": "It seems the script is not progressing beyond the initial debug statement, \"Debug: Starting detailed diagnostic procedure.\" This suggests that the script might be encountering an issue early in its execution, possibly during the retrieval of entities or due to an error that isn't being caught properly. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Entity Retrieval**: Ensure that the `get_entities` function is correctly retrieving entities from the game environment. If the entities are not being retrieved, the script will not proceed past the initial checks.\n\n2. **Add More Debugging Prints**: Add additional print statements immediately after each `get_entities` call to verify that entities are being retrieved correctly. This will help identify which entity retrieval is failing.\n\n3. **Check for Exceptions**: Ensure that exceptions are being caught and printed. If an exception is occurring before the assertions, it might not be visible. Double-check the exception handling block to ensure it captures and prints any errors.\n\n4. **Environment Setup**: Double-check the setup of your Factorio environment to ensure all entities are correctly placed and accessible. If the environment is not set up correctly, the entities might not be found.\n\n5. **Simplify the Script**: Temporarily simplify the script to focus on just retrieving and printing the entities. This can help isolate the issue:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Debug: Starting detailed diagnostic procedure\")\n\ntry:\n    # Attempt to retrieve each type of entity\n    print(\"Debug: Attempting to retrieve necessary entities...\")\n\n    offshore_pumps = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    boilers = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    steam_engines = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    electric_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    assembling_machines = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n\n    # Debug: Output retrieval results\n    print(f\"Debug: Offshore Pumps - {offshore_pumps}\")\n    print(f\"Debug: Boilers - {boilers}\")\n    print(f\"Debug: Steam Engines - {steam_engines}\")\n    print(f\"Debug: Electric Poles - {electric_poles}\")\n    print(f\"Debug: Assembling Machines - {assembling_machines}\")\n\n    # Check for presence of all required entities\n    missing_entities = []\n    if not offshore_pumps:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Offshore Pump\")\n    if not boilers:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Boiler\")\n    if not steam_engines:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Steam Engine\")\n    if not electric_poles:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Electric Pole\")\n    if not assembling_machines:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Assembling Machine\")\n\n    if missing_entities:\n        print(f\"Debug: Missing entities detected: {', '.join(missing_entities)}\")\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Missing Entities: {', '.join(missing_entities)}\")\n\n    print(\"Debug: All necessary entities retrieved successfully.\")\n\nexcept AssertionError as ae:\n    print(f\"Debug: Entity Retrieval Assertion Error: {ae}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Debug: Unexpected Exception during Diagnostics: {e}\")\n```\n\nBy focusing on just the retrieval and printing of entities, you can determine if the issue lies with entity retrieval or elsewhere in the script. Once the retrieval is confirmed to be working, you can gradually reintroduce other parts of the script to identify where the problem occurs.", "summary_range": "[1-336]"}
