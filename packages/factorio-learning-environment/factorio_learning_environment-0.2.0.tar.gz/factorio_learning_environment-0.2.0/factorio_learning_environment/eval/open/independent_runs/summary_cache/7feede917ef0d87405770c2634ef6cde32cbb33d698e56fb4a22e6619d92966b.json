Regularly check the fuel status and refill as necessary.\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for source items**: Check the inventory of the source entity (e.g., wooden chest) to ensure it has the required items. If the source is empty, refill it to allow the inserter to operate.\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for space in destination**: Ensure that the destination entity (e.g., wooden chest) has enough space to accept items. If it is full, consider removing items or expanding storage capacity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: \n  - `refuel_burner_mining_drill(position: Tuple[float, float], fuel: str) -> None`\n    - **Success**: Successfully refueled the burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0) multiple times.\n    - **Failure**: No failures reported for this function.\n  \n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position: Tuple[float, float]` - Position of the burner mining drill.\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Inventory of the wooden chest.\n  - `stone_furnace_status: str` - Status of the stone furnace."}
