{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Currently, it is out of fuel and requires coal to function.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or lack of fuel.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Fuel Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to pick up items from the chest and drop them into the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates potential misalignment.\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters with coal to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for any blockages or misalignments in the inserter setup.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that sufficient coal is available in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Lack of coal in the inventory can lead to operational disruptions.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the efficiency of the iron ore processing facility can be significantly improved, leading to better resource management and production output."}
