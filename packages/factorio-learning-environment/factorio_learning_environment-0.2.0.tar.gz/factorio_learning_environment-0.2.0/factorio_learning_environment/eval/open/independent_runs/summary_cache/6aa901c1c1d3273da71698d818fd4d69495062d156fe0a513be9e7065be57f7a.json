{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the processed outputs.\nUpdates:\n- Steps 38\u201347 to 62: Managed and processed iron ore into iron plates with periodic inventory updates and timeout errors due to resource shortages or delayed processing.\n- Steps 64\u201365: Although a new Stone Furnace for copper smelting was attempted at the copper ore patch (x=-28.5, y=-61.5) but failed due to lack of inventory, the agent used the existing Stone Furnace at (46.0, -82.0) for copper ore insertion. An error in entity reference occurred during the copper smelting insertion.\n- Steps 66\u201367: Successfully inserted 10 copper ore into the furnace, leading to a gradual production of copper plates followed by extraction of 10 copper plates into player inventory. Additionally, a recipe was executed to convert 10 copper plates into 10 copper cables.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement, Inventory Checks, and API Argument Handling\n- Verify availability of required items in inventory before placing entities. Ensure sufficient resources prior to insertion operations.\n- When inserting items, provide a valid Entity or EntityGroup rather than a Position to avoid entity reference errors.\n\n### Timeout, Waiting Cycle, and Stale Data Management\n- Monitor processing progress closely with fuel and ingredient verification to minimize delays.\n- Update entity data following inventory changes to prevent decisions based on outdated information."}
