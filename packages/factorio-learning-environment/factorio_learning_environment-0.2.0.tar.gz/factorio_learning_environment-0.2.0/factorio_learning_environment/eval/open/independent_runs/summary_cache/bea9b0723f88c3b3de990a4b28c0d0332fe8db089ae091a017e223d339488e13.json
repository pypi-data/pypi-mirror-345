{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel inventory containing 6 coal and furnace source inventory containing 6 copper-ore, producing iron-plate.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 50 iron-plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, check for the presence of iron-plates or copper-ore before insertion.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Verify that the target entity contains the item you are trying to extract. If the entity does not have the item, the extraction will fail.\n\n### Errors when crafting due to insufficient resources\n- Always check your inventory for the necessary resources before attempting to craft items. This will help avoid crafting errors due to lack of materials.\n\n### Repeated errors with extracting copper plates\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is configured to produce copper plates before attempting to extract them. If the furnace does not contain copper plates, the extraction will fail.\n\n### Repeated errors with inserting copper ore into the furnace\n- Confirm that you have copper ore in your inventory before trying to insert it into the furnace. If you lack the resource, the insertion will not succeed. \n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, position=chest_position)`: Failed due to distance.\n- `insert_item(Prototype.IronPlate, chest, quantity=50)`: Failed due to lack of iron-plates in inventory.\n- `extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, stone_furnace, quantity=50)`: Failed due to absence of copper-plates in the furnace.\n- `insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, stone_furnace, quantity=8)`: Failed due to lack of copper-ore in inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `chest_position`: Tuple (float, float) - position for placing the wooden chest.\n- `stone_furnace`: Entity - reference to the stone furnace entity.\n- `chest`: Entity - reference to the wooden chest entity.\n- `quantity`: Integer - number of items to insert or extract."}
