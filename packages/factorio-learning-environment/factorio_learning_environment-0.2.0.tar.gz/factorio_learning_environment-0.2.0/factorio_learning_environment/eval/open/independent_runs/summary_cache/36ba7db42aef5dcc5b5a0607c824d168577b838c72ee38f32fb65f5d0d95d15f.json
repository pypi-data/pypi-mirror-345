{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 24.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 24.0) and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The boiler is currently not connected to any fluid sources, and the offshore pump is also not connected to any fluid network.\n\n### Lab at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a lab (position 0.0, 0.0) and a lab (position 5.0, 5.0). Both labs are currently not powered and are set to research automation.\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, and a stone furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Electric poles\nConsists of multiple small electric poles positioned at:\n- (1.5, -12.5)\n- (0.5, -12.5)\n- (-0.5, -11.5)\n- (-1.5, -11.5)\n- (0.5, -11.5)\n- (1.5, -10.5)\n- (1.5, -11.5)\n- (-2.5, -8.5)\n- (-2.5, -9.5)\n- (1.5, -9.5)\n- (-2.5, -6.5)\n- (-1.5, -7.5)\n- (-0.5, -7.5)\n- (0.5, -7.5)\n- (1.5, -7.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes. Check the surrounding area for any entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Confirm that the offshore pump is positioned correctly and that there are no other entities blocking the connection to the boiler.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to a power network. Check the connections of electric poles and ensure they are within range of the entities needing power.\n\n### Errors with lab power\n- Ensure that labs are connected to a power source to enable research activities. Check for any disconnections in the power network.\n\n### Errors with furnace ingredients\n- Make sure to provide the necessary ingredients to the furnaces to enable smelting operations. Check the inventory and supply lines to ensure they are adequately stocked."}
