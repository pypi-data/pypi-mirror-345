{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automated Coal Mining System (around position x=38, y=-83)\nSelf-sustaining coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=38.0, y=-83.0) facing RIGHT\n- Transport belt line running DOWN from y=-83.5 to y=-86.5\n- Recycling burner inserter (x=38.5, y=-84.5) facing RIGHT to fuel the drill\n- Output burner inserter (x=38.5, y=-86.5) facing RIGHT\n- Output wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-86.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility (around position x=45-47, y=-80)\nSmelting setup consisting of:\n- Two stone furnaces at:\n  - (x=45.0, y=-80.0)\n  - (x=47.0, y=-80.0)\n- Input inserters:\n  - Burner inserter (x=45.5, y=-78.5)\n  - Burner inserter (x=47.5, y=-78.5)\n- Output inserters:\n  - Burner inserter (x=45.5, y=-81.5)\n  - Burner inserter (x=47.5, y=-81.5)\n- Storage chests:\n  - Input chests at:\n    - (x=45.5, y=-77.5)\n    - (x=47.5, y=-77.5)\n  - Output chests at:\n    - (x=45.5, y=-82.5) containing 34 iron plates\n    - (x=47.5, y=-82.5) containing 29 iron plates\n  - Additional storage:\n    - Chest at (x=49.5, y=-80.5) with 800 coal\n    - Chest at (x=49.5, y=-79.5) with 50 coal and 1480 iron plates\n\n### Transport Infrastructure\n- Belt group running RIGHT from x=52.5 to x=56.5 at y=-81.5\n- Single belt at (x=44.5, y=-81.5) facing RIGHT\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n1. Belt Placement and Direction Issues\n- Ensure belt directions align properly with the intended flow of materials\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to place new ones\n- Verify belt connections form a continuous line\n\n2. Entity Positioning\n- Double check entity drop positions align with belt inputs\n- Ensure inserters are properly positioned relative to their pickup and drop locations\n- Verify mining drill output aligns with transport system\n\n3. System Capacity Issues\n- Monitor chest capacity to prevent overflow\n- Ensure sufficient fuel supply for burner entities\n- Clear jammed belts that may block mining drill output\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Position: Tuple[float, float] - Used for entity coordinates\n- Direction: Enum - Specifies entity orientation\n- EntityStatus: Enum - Indicates operational state\n- Inventory: Dict[str, int] - Tracks item quantities\n\nNo custom functions were defined in the provided logs."}
