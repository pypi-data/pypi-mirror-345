{"content": "Here is the updated report:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Functional Power Plant at (200,200) (New)\n- **Boiler** at (203.0, 200.5) - Steam production (fueled with coal)\n- **Steam engine** at (206.5, 200.5) - Power generation\n- **Assembling machine 2** at (210.5, 200.5) - Circuit production (unpowered)\n- **Stone furnace** at (200.0, 200.0) - Manual smelting (inactive)\n\n### Previous Structures (Cleared)\n- All previous power plant attempts and production lines were cleared during steps 88-95\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Collisions (Critical)\n- 30+ failed placement attempts due to:\n  1. Not clearing existing objects before rebuilds\n  2. Attempting to place over existing entities\n- Required solutions:\n  1. Implement systematic cleanup before new builds\n  2. Use get_colliding_entities() pre-check\n  3. Maintain build area tracking\n\n### Power System Design (Persistent)\n- Continued connection failures in new builds\n- Critical issues:\n  1. Missing pipe connections\n  2. Unpowered assemblers despite nearby power\n  3. Boiler not connected to water source\n- Design requirements:\n  1. Complete fluid connections before power\n  2. Verify all connection points\n  3. Test power network coverage\n\n### Crafting System Errors (New)\n- Multiple crafting failures due to:\n  1. Attempting manual crafting of machine-only recipes\n  2. Missing ingredient verification\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Check recipe requirements before crafting\n  2. Use proper smelting/assembling machines\n  3. Verify input inventories\n\n### Position Validation (Ongoing)\n- Continued placement failures at occupied positions\n- Required improvements:\n  1. Implement position validation wrapper\n  2. Use integer grid coordinates\n  3. Maintain build area map\n\n### Previous Unresolved Issues\n- No functional production lines\n- Power plant not fully connected\n- Assembler remains unpowered\n- Furnace inactive due to missing inputs\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `find_clear_land_near_power()` -> Position\n  - Still unused due to placement issues\n  - Needs collision detection implementation\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler`: Primary steam producer at (203.0, 200.5)\n- `steam_engine`: Power generator at (206.5, 200.5)\n- `assembling_machine`: Unpowered circuit producer at (210.5, 200.5)"}
