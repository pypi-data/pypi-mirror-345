{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 8-15)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation at (15.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (16.0,74.0) for smelting\n- Burner inserter at (14.5,73.5) feeding coal into furnace\n\n### Expanded Mining Operation at (16.0,71.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0,71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (17.0,74.0) for smelting\n- Burner inserter at (15.5,73.5) feeding coal into furnace\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,-2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,-2.5) collecting water\n- Boiler at (-3.0,-2.5) converting water to steam\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler\n\n### Additional Power Generation Attempts\n- Offshore pumps placed at (-9.5,-0.5), (-9.5,0.5), (-9.5,-1.5), (-21.5,-1.5), (-21.5,-2.5)\n- Boilers placed at (-5.0,-2.5), (-6.0,3.5), (-4.0,0.5)\n- Partial pipe connections between some pumps and boilers\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement on water tiles (recurring issue)\n- Multiple failed attempts to place boilers and steam engines on/near water tiles\n- Always verify terrain type before placement, especially near water sources\n- Use the map view to check for water before placing entities\n\n### Power generation failures\n- Steam engine at (-2.5,6.5) not producing power despite being connected\n- Verify boiler has sufficient fuel and water supply\n- Check pipe connections for proper fluid flow\n\n### Entity placement conflicts\n- Multiple attempts to place entities where other entities already exist\n- Always scan the target area before placement attempts\n\n### Mining operation issues\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0,71.0) output blocked due to lack of destination\n- Ensure mining drills have valid output paths (belts/chests) before activation\n- Verify inserter positions and orientations for proper furnace feeding\n\n### Water source location\n- Failed to find suitable water location for offshore pump placement\n- Explore more map area to find accessible water sources\n- Consider building power plants closer to existing water sources\n\n### Fluid system problems\n- Some pipe connections show empty status despite proper placement\n- Verify complete fluid path from pump to boiler to engine\n- Check for missing pipe segments or incorrect connections"}
