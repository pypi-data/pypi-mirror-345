{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been created on the map as of the latest execution steps. All placement attempts have resulted in failure, and there are no entities currently present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place an entity. Many placement attempts failed due to unsuitable or occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors due to pathfinding\n- When planning to move to a distant location, ensure that a valid path exists. An error occurred when attempting to move to an unreachable location at x=1000.0 y=1000.0.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect data types\n- Ensure that data types used in operations are correct. An error was encountered due to using a string index where an integer was expected.\n\n### General placement diagnostics\n- Consider global constraints that might affect placement, such as terrain or other environmental factors, which might not be immediately visible but can prevent successful placement."}
