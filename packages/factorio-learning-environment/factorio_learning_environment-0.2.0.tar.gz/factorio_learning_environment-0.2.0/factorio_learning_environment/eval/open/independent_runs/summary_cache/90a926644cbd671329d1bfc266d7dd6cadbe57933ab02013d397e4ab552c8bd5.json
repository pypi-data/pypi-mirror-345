{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) - Note: Currently out of fuel\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) fueled with coal\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) to collect resources from the drill\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) - Note: Missing copper-plate for production\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) waiting for source items\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Resource Storage\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=2.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for production processes. For example, the assembling machine at (x=10.5, y=0.5) requires copper-plate to produce copper-cable.\n\n### Errors Due to Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers to maintain continuous operation. The boiler at (x=20.5, y=-4.0) is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that inserters have access to source items to avoid idle time. The inserter at (x=-3.5, y=1.5) is currently waiting for source items."}
