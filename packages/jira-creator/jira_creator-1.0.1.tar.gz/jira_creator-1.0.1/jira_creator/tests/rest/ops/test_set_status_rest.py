"""
This file contains test cases for the set_status method in a client class.
The test_set_status_valid_transition function tests the method with a valid transition to 'In Progress' status.
It mocks the response for GET and POST requests and asserts that the _request method is called twice.

The test_set_status_invalid_transition function tests the method with an invalid transition to 'Done' status.
It uses pytest.raises to capture the exception and asserts that the _request method is called only once.

Functions:
- test_set_status_valid_transition(client): Set the status of a client to a valid transition.
- test_set_status_invalid_transition(client): Check if setting an invalid status transition raises an exception.

Arguments:
- client (object): An object representing the client whose status needs to be updated.
