{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n    - Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore\n- **Furnaces** for smelting iron ore:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n    - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n    - Fuel: Coal\n    - Result Inventory: Iron plates\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: WORKING\n    - Fuel: Coal\n    - Source Inventory: Iron ore\n    - Result Inventory: Iron plates\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n    - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n    - Fuel: Coal\n    - Result Inventory: Iron plates\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions:\n  - (5.5, -60.5)\n  - (7.5, -60.5)\n  - (6.5, -60.5)\n  - (9.5, -60.5)\n  - (8.5, -60.5)\n  - (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore\n  - (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure adequate coal is available in the inventory to refuel the burner mining drill and furnaces. Regularly check coal levels and replenish as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors from Full Output Chests\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill to avoid halting mining operations. Implement a routine to manage inventory space effectively.\n\n### Errors from Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure a consistent supply of iron ore to the furnaces to prevent them from running out of ingredients. Monitor the input inventory of each furnace and adjust resource allocation accordingly.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the number of items in the player's inventory, including 'wooden-chest', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus - Monitors the operational status and warnings of the burner mining drill.\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus - Monitors the operational status and warnings of each furnace.\n"}
