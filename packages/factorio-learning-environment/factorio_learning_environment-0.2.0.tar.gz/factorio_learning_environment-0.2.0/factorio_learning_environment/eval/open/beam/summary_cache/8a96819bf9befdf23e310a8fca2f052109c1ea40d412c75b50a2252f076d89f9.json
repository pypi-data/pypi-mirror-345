{"content": "I notice a pattern in the errors - the furnace appears to be completely full but showing empty when we inspect it. Let's try a different approach:\n\n```python\n# First let's check what iron plates are available in other furnaces\nfurnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nprint(\"Checking all furnaces for iron plates...\")\n\nfor furnace in furnaces:\n    contents = inspect_inventory(furnace)\n    if Prototype.IronPlate in contents:\n        print(f\"Found {contents[Prototype.IronPlate]} iron plates in furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n        # Move to this furnace\n        move_to(furnace.position)\n        # Extract the plates\n        extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, contents[Prototype.IronPlate])\n        print(f\"Extracted plates. Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n        break\n\n# Now let's see if we have enough iron plates to craft\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\nif inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 2:\n    # Craft iron gear wheels first\n    craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=1)\n    print(\"Crafted iron gear wheel\")\n    \n    # Then craft inserter if we have enough materials\n    if inventory.get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0) >= 1 and inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 1:\n        craft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter, quantity=1)\n        print(\"Crafted burner inserter\")\n\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Looks for existing iron plates in any furnace\n2. Extracts them if found\n3. Attempts to craft with what we have\n4. Avoids dealing with the problematic furnace that seems to be in an inconsistent state\n\nLet's see if we can get the materials we need this way.", "summary_range": "[1-3552]"}
