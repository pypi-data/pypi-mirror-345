{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler, and attempts to connect from the boiler to the steam engine. The pipe network is incomplete due to connection errors.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=3.5, y=17.5) associated with fluid system 7451, currently empty.\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) associated with fluid system 7462, carrying water and marked as full output.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 13949, consisting of poles at various positions including (x=10.5, y=13.5), (x=7.5, y=8.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), and others, with a voltage of 0 indicating no power generation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are within a valid range and that the connection path is clear of any obstacles.\n- Verify the correct usage of prototypes; for example, use `Prototype.Pipe` and `Prototype.PipeToGround` correctly, ensuring the correct attributes are used.\n\n### Attribute Errors with Prototypes\n- Double-check the attributes of the `Prototype` class to ensure correct usage. For instance, `Prototype.PipeToGround` should be replaced with the correct attribute if it is not defined.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like boilers. Keep track of your coal inventory to avoid running out unexpectedly.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect two entities using specified prototypes. Encountered failures due to incorrect attributes and connection path issues.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of connected pipe entities, subject to connection errors.\n- `boiler`: Entity representing the boiler, requiring fuel management.\n- `steam_output_position`: Position variable used for connecting steam output, needs correct connection path.\n\nThis report summarizes the current state of the agent's structures and provides guidance on addressing common errors encountered during the execution steps."}
