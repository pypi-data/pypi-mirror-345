{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities with positions ranging from (x=20.5, y=-10.5) to (x=20.5, y=-5.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and another at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) with a shortage of copper-plate\n- Inserter at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=5.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (x=-3.5, y=0.5) and (x=-3.5, y=2.5)\n- Inserters at Positions (x=-3.5, y=1.5) and (x=9.5, y=5.5) waiting for source items\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting various entities\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5) connected to a PipeGroup with positions ranging from (x=4.5, y=-9.5) to (x=8.5, y=-7.5)\n\n### Electrical Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=9.5, y=7.5) and (x=-5.5, y=1.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, coal was missing when trying to refuel the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. This can occur if the supply chain is not properly feeding items to the inserters.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients for Production\n- Make sure the required ingredients are available for production in assembling machines and furnaces to avoid shortages and warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt\" or \"missing resources: copper-plate\"."}
