{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -28.0, -61.0) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace (position -27.0, -59.0) smelting copper plates\n- Burner inserter (position -25.5, -58.5) moving plates to output chest\n- Wooden chest (position -24.5, -58.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Iron Production Line at (-10.0, -59.0)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills in sequence (positions -10.0/-59.0, -8.0/-59.0, -6.0/-59.0) mining iron ore\n- Multiple wooden chests (positions -9.5/-57.5, -7.5/-57.5, -5.5/-57.5) storing iron ore\n- Multiple burner inserters managing ore movement between components\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Smelting Array at (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces in sequence (positions 0.0/0.0, 2.0/0.0, 4.0/0.0, 6.0/0.0)\n- Input wooden chests (positions 0.5/-2.5, 2.5/-2.5, 4.5/-2.5, 6.5/-2.5)\n- Output wooden chests (positions 0.5/2.5, 2.5/2.5, 4.5/2.5, 6.5/2.5)\n- Burner inserters managing material movement between chests and furnaces\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Multiple belt groups connecting mining operations to processing facilities\n- Main belt lines running from mining area to smelting array\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if target position is already occupied by another entity before placement\n- Ensure drop positions of mining drills and inserters don't overlap with existing entities\n\n### Entity placement coordination issues\n- When placing connected structures, ensure proper spacing between components\n- Consider the working area and drop positions of mining drills and inserters when planning layout\n\n### Resource management warnings\n- Multiple entities showing \"waiting for source items\" - ensure proper material flow\n- Some inserters showing \"output blocked\" - verify destination has available space\n- Several furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - check input material supply chain"}
