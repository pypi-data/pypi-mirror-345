{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory of coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from chests to furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace at (-12.0, -48.0) is operational, while the one at (-10.0, -48.0) lacks ingredients.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at various positions for storing iron plates:\n  - (-7.5, -48.5) with 60 iron plates\n  - (-6.5, -48.5) and (-6.5, -49.5) each with 1500 iron plates\n  - (-4.5, -48.5) with 62 iron plates\n  - (-5.5, -48.5) with 1500 iron plates\n  - (-3.5, -48.5) empty\n  - (-14.5, -46.5) with iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) for moving iron plates between furnaces and chests. Some inserters are waiting for source items or space in destination.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity has the required items before attempting to extract. The agent encountered multiple extraction failures due to attempting to extract iron plates when none were available.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Regularly check and clear blockages at inserter drop positions to ensure smooth operation. Blockages were detected multiple times, requiring manual intervention to clear.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Verify that the inventory has the necessary items before attempting to insert them into another entity. The agent faced issues with inserting items due to lack of items in inventory.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in all entities to prevent interruptions in operations. Refueling actions were necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the agent can improve efficiency and reduce operational disruptions."}
