{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (type: stone-furnace) at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory contains 9 units of coal\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory contains 3 iron plates\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n### Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of 10 automation science packs\n  - Status: No power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. The stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) was repeatedly attempted to be filled beyond its capacity.\n\n### Errors when inserting incompatible items\n- Verify the contents of the target inventory before inserting items. Attempted to insert iron plates into a furnace already containing iron ore.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent entities\n- Confirm the presence of the entity and the item within it before attempting extraction. Multiple attempts were made to extract iron plates and iron ore from a stone furnace that did not contain them.\n\n### Errors due to missing resources for crafting\n- Gather or craft the necessary resources before attempting to craft items. The agent attempted to craft a solar panel without sufficient copper plates, steel plates, and electronic circuits.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Ensure that all structures requiring power are connected to a power source to function correctly. The lab was reported as having no power."}
