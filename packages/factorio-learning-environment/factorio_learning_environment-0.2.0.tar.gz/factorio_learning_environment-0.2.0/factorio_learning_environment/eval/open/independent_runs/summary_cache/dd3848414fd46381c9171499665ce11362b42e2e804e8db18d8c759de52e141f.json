{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (Around x=41, y=-82)\nComplex structure for mining and transporting coal consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Storage iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) collecting mined coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) serving as intermediate storage\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5) for moving coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt system:\n  - Belt at (42.5, -79.5) facing DOWN\n  - Belt at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n\n### Furnace System (Around x=45, y=-81)\nSmelting setup consisting of:\n- Burner inserter at (43.5, -80.5) for fuel insertion\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n- Additional stone furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Storage wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Belt Transport Network\nExtended belt system connecting various components:\n- Main belt line running from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5\n- Multiple interconnected belts forming a transport network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Verify target location is clear before placing entities\n- Check for existing objects that might block placement\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities when building automated systems\n\n### Entity Orientation Issues\n- Double-check inserter orientations match intended pickup and drop locations\n- When adjusting inserter orientations, remove existing inserter first before placing new one\n- Pay attention to pickup/drop positions in relation to connected entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices\n- Ensure proper fuel distribution to all powered entities\n- Watch for \"full\" warnings in chests and manage inventory accordingly\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails when target location is occupied.\n- get_entity(): Retrieves entity at specified position. Fails if entity type doesn't match or no entity exists.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- furnace: Furnace\n- belt: TransportBelt\n\nStatus tracking:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Entity is functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.NO_FUEL: Entity requires fuel to operate\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Entity waiting for input materials\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Entity missing required materials\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Basic operational state\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Output blocked or full"}
