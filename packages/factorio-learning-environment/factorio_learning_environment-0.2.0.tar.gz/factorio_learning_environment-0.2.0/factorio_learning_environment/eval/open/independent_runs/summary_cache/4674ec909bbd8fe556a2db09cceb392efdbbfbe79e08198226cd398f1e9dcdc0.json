{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nCurrently, there are no structures successfully created by the agent on the map. The agent has been attempting to place offshore pumps and boilers but has not succeeded due to unsuitable positions and validation errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in placing offshore pumps\n- Ensure that the position chosen for placing offshore pumps is suitable. The agent has repeatedly attempted to place offshore pumps at various coordinates without success.\n- Verify the input parameters for offshore pump placement. There were validation errors indicating issues with data types for height and width.\n- Avoid using non-callable objects as positions. The error \"'Position' object is not callable\" suggests misuse of the Position object.\n\n### Errors in placing boilers\n- Ensure that the position chosen for placing boilers is suitable. Multiple attempts to place boilers have failed due to unsuitable positions.\n- Verify the input parameters for boiler placement. Similar to offshore pumps, there were validation errors indicating issues with data types for height and width.\n- Avoid using non-callable objects as positions. The error \"'Position' object is not callable\" suggests misuse of the Position object.\n\n### General API Misuse\n- Ensure that all arguments passed to functions are of the correct type. Errors such as \"int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a real number\" indicate incorrect argument types being used."}
