Craft or acquire the required items beforehand.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Labs Not Receiving Power\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are within range of a powered electric pole. Ensure electric poles are connected to a functional power source and check for any gaps in the power network.\n\n### Errors with Full Output Warnings\n- Regularly check and clear output inventories for entities like furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
