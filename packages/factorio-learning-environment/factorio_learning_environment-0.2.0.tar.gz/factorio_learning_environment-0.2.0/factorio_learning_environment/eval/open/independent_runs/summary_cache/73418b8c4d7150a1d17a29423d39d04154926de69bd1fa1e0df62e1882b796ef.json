{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Multiple iron chests and wooden chests for storage at various positions\n\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore. The mining drill extracts iron ore, which is then transferred to the stone furnaces for smelting into iron plates. The output is stored in nearby chests.\n\n### Coal Storage Facility at Position (47.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple iron chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n\nThis facility is used for storing coal and iron plates. The burner mining drill extracts coal, which is then transferred to the storage chests. The stone furnace is used for smelting operations, and burner inserters facilitate the transfer of resources between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that storage chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full drop positions. For example, the chest at drop position (41.5, -80.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Errors Due to Inserters Running Out of Fuel\n- Keep an eye on the fuel levels of burner inserters to ensure they remain operational. Refuel inserters regularly to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Errors When Furnaces Have No Ingredients\n- Make sure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to avoid halts in production. Regularly check and transfer necessary resources to the furnaces to keep them working efficiently."}
