Verify that the chosen fluid_system identifiers correspond to an existing pipe group and that the search radius encompasses them.\n- Consistency in Pipeline Network Parameters:\n  - Ensure that fluid_system identifiers are uniformly updated across all interconnected entities (boiler, offshore pump, and pipe groups). Mismatches in these parameters lead to aborted connection attempts.\n- Inventory Attribute Usage:\n  - Use only supported inventory attributes when accessing or modifying inventory items to prevent related errors."}
