{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) with fuel (coal: 11) and iron-plate output.\n- Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with fuel (coal: 8) and iron-plate output.\n- Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with fuel (coal: 12) and iron-plate output.\n- Burner inserters at positions (-17.5, -47.5), (-15.5, -47.5), and (-13.5, -47.5) for moving materials between furnaces and other entities.\n- Transport belt connecting furnaces and inserters, facilitating movement of iron plates.\n\n### Iron Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-13.5, -45.5), and (-14.5, -45.5) for transferring iron plates between chests and other entities.\n- Transport belt connecting chests and inserters, facilitating movement of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts Directly to Chests\n- Ensure to use an inserter to input items into a chest instead of connecting belts directly to it.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to avoid interruptions in refueling furnaces and inserters.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity to accept the output from inserters to prevent blockage.\n- Regularly check and clear any items blocking the output path of inserters to maintain smooth operation."}
