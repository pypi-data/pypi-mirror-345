{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup (around y=-81)\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Output inserters and chests:\n  - Burner inserter at (45.5, -82.5) feeding into wooden chest at (45.5, -83.5)\n  - Burner inserter at (47.5, -82.5) feeding into wooden chest at (47.5, -83.5)\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (around y=-82)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Two iron chests for coal storage:\n  - At (41.5, -84.5) containing 1600 coal\n  - At (41.5, -83.5) containing 797 coal\n\n### Storage Area (around y=-79 to -80)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing coal (full)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -79.5) storing coal and iron plates\n- Wooden chest at (46.5, -78.5)\n\n### Transport Belt System (y=-79.5)\n- Three transport belts placed at:\n  - Center belt (46.5, -79.5)\n  - Left belt (45.5, -79.5)\n  - Right belt (47.5, -79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Always check if target location is clear before placing entities\n   - Remove existing entities if they conflict with new construction\n   - Ensure proper spacing between entities (especially for inserters and belts)\n\n2. Missing Resources\n   - Ensure required items are in inventory before placement (e.g., splitter was missing)\n   - Keep track of inventory counts for critical building materials\n\n3. Entity Spacing\n   - Leave adequate space between inserters and belts\n   - Consider the working area needed for inserters when planning layouts\n   - Account for entity sizes when planning construction (furnaces are 2x2, inserters 1x1)\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  - Failures: Placement conflicts with existing entities\n  - Success: When placement location is clear and item is in inventory\n\nImportant Variables:\n- left_belt: transport-belt\n- center_belt: transport-belt\n- right_belt: transport-belt\n- input_inserter: burner-inserter\n- left_inserter: burner-inserter"}
