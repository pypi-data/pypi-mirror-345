{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), boiler (position to be determined), and steam engine (position to be determined). The offshore pump is currently working and connected to the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Assembling machine at position (to be determined) and inserter at position (to be determined) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position to be determined) that connects the furnace at position (to be determined) to assembling machine at position (to be determined)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions in the path when attempting to connect pipes or other entities. Clear any pipe groups or other entities blocking the connection.\n\n### Errors when using electricity groups\n- Make sure to connect electricity groups to the electric network properly. Check the status of electricity groups and ensure they are plugged in.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors when retrying connections\n- If a connection fails, check the surrounding area for any obstructions or issues that may prevent the connection from being established."}
