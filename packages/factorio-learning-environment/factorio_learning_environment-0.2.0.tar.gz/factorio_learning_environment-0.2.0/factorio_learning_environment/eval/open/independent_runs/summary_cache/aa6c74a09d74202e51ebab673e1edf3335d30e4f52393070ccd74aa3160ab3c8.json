{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) for storing output\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (7.5, -60.5) for power supply\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack and currently researching Automation\n- Powered by the electricity generator\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that boilers and furnaces are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure inserters are correctly positioned and powered to move items between entities efficiently. Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are set correctly to avoid waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement and Connectivity\n- Ensure that entities like pipes and electric poles are correctly connected to form a continuous network. Verify connections to avoid disruptions in power and fluid flow."}
