Reposition and align inserters if they are not transferring items as expected.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the inserters are fueled and operational.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly monitor and empty the chest at the drop position to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest. This will ensure continuous mining and resource collection.\n\n### Inserter Fuel Management\n- Keep inserters fueled to maintain their operation. Regularly refuel inserters to prevent interruptions in item transfer processes."}
