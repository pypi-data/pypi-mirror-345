{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch. Currently operational but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore. Contains 19 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Currently operational but frequently runs out of fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or fuel issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Reposition if necessary to ensure proper item flow.\n- Regularly check the inserter's fuel status to prevent it from running out of fuel, which halts the transfer process.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Monitor the chest's capacity to prevent it from becoming full, which stops the mining drill from operating. Regularly extract items from the chest to maintain space.\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory to refuel both the mining drill and the inserter to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Check the inserter setup and ensure it is functioning correctly.\n- Maintain an adequate fuel supply in the furnace to ensure it can operate when ingredients are available."}
