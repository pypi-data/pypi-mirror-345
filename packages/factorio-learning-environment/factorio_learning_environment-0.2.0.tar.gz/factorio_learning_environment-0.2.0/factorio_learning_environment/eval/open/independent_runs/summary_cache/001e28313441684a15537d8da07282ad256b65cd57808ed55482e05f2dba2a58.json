In this case, ensure that `iron_plate_chest_positions` is a list of inventories, not positions.\n\n### Warnings of Full Chests\n- Regularly check and clear out chests that are full to prevent halting of production processes, such as mining or smelting.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the logs provided.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_storage_capacity`: Integer, calculated as the sum of iron plates in specified chests.\n- `iron_plate_chest_positions`: Expected to be a list of inventories but incorrectly used as a list of positions."}
