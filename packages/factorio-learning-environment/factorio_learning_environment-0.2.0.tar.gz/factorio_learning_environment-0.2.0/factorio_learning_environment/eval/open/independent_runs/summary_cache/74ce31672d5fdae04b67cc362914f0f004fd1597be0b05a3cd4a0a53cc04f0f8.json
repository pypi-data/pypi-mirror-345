{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler is used to heat water and produce steam, while the steam engine converts steam into electricity.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) which is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) which extracts iron ore from the ground.\n- Multiple wooden chests for storage (positions 46.5, -83.5), (48.5, -83.5), (5.5, -79.5), (10.5, -79.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, the Offshore Pump cannot be placed as it is not in inventory.\n- Regularly check your inventory to avoid running out of essential items like pipes, which are required to connect the Boiler to the Steam Engine.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it, to avoid placement errors."}
