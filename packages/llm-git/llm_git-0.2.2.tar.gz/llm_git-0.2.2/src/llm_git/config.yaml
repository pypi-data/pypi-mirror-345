    - Be terse and concise
    - For small changes, 1 or 2 sentences are enough
    - Mostly professional, but can be casual
    - Avoid filler words

  extend_prompt: |
    {old_prompt}
    
    ## Additional Instructions
    {add_prompt}

  extend_prompt_commit_metadata: |
    {old_prompt}
    ## Metadata
    Make sure this trailer is at the end of your commit message:
    Co-authored-by: llm-git <llm-git@ttll.de>

  # Shared sections for commit messages
  commit_intro: |
    {prompt[assistant_intro]}
    
    {prompt[writing_style]}
    
    ## Context
    - Working directory: `{pwd}`
    - Current branch: `{branch}`

  commit_requirements: |
    ## Requirements
    - Use the "conventional commits" format
    - If the branchname includes a ticket number, use it in the commit message
    - Make sure all trailers are at the end of the commit message and separated by a blank line

  # Regular commit message template
  commit_message: |
    {prompt[commit_intro]}
    
    {prompt[commit_requirements]}
    
    ## Output
    Only output the commit message.

  # Amend commit message template
  commit_message_amend: |
    {prompt[commit_intro]}
    - You are amending an existing commit
    
    {prompt[commit_requirements]}
    - Consider both the previous commit message and the new changes
    - Maintain the same scope and type as the original commit if appropriate
    
    ## Previous Commit Message
    ```
    {previous_message}
    ```
    
    ## Output
    Only output the updated commit message.

  branch_name: |
    {prompt[assistant_intro]}
    
    ## Task
    Extract a one line branch name from the commit range.
    
    ## Format
    Use the following pattern: `TICKET-1234.description-of-the-branch`
    where TICKET-1234 is the ticket number extracted from the commit messages.
    
    ## Output
    Only output the branch name and nothing else.

  tag_name: |
    {prompt[assistant_intro]}
    
    ## Task
    Generate a suitable tag name and a concise tag message from the commit range.
    
    ## Format
    Tag Name: Use semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.2.3`) or a descriptive name (e.g., `release-candidate-feature-x`). Consider the nature of the changes (fix, feature, breaking change) when deciding on the version bump or name.
    Tag Message: Provide a brief summary of the changes included in this tag. Follow commit message conventions (imperative mood, concise).
    
    ## Output
    Output the tag name on the first line.
    Output the tag message on the subsequent lines, separated from the tag name by a single blank line.
    Example:
    v1.1.0
    
    feat: Add user authentication
    
    This release introduces user login and registration functionality.

    - Use conventional commits format for the PR description and PR title
    - Extract a type and scope from the commits to come up with the PR title
    - Extract the ticket number from the tickets and put it in the footer
    
    ## Output
    Only output the PR description.

    It must be relative to HEAD.

  apply_patch_custom_instructions: |
    {prompt[apply_patch_base]}
    
    ## Instructions
    {instructions}

  apply_patch_minimal: |
    {prompt[apply_patch_base]}
    
    ## Output Requirements
    - Focus on the most important changes first
    - Prioritize logical groupings of changes
    - Ensure the patch can be applied cleanly
    - Only include changes that make sense together

  improve_rebase_plan: |
    {prompt[assistant_intro]}
    
    You are an expert Git user helping to improve a rebase plan.
    
    ## Context
    You are being called during an interactive rebase to improve the rebase plan.
    
    ## Rewrite commit messages
    
    Use the instruction
    ```
    exec llm git commit --amend [--extend-prompt "INSTRUCTIONS"]
    ```
    to rewrite commit messages.
    
    ## Requirements
    - Analyze the rebase plan and commit details
    - Look for opportunities to:
      - Squash related commits.
      - Reorder commits logically
      - Make sure to avoid conflicts. Be conservative.
    - Be hesitant to drop any commits. When dropping a commit, add a comment explaining why.
    - Unless you want to leave a commit message exactly as it is, use the `exec` command to rewrite it.
    - Return ONLY the improved rebase plan, nothing else
    - Maintain the same format as the original plan
    - Each line must start with a command (pick, reword, squash, exec, etc.) followed by the commit hash
    - Do not change the commit hashes
    - Omit the standard instructions that are commented out.
    
    ## Output
    Return only the improved rebase plan, maintaining the exact format required by Git.

    ```
    {rebase_plan}
