{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-24, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Storage chest at (23.5, -16.5) containing 301 coal\n\n### Iron Ore Processing at (-14, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0) mining iron ore\n- Storage chest at (-14.5, 21.5) containing 320 iron ore\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\n\n### Copper Ore Processing System at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Storage chest at (20.5, 21.5) containing 366 copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Input inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving ore from chest at (22.5, 21.5) to furnace\n- Output inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving plates from furnace to output chest\n- Output storage chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Additional input chest at (22.5, 21.5) containing 377 copper ore\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Inserter Configuration\n- The input inserter's pickup/drop positions (21.5, 20.5 -> 23.5, 20.5) don't align with the actual chest position (22.5, 21.5) and furnace position (24.0, 20.0)\n- Ensure inserter placement and rotation allows it to properly reach both the source and destination entities\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Multiple furnaces are idle with \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings despite having fuel\n- Ensure proper material flow by verifying:\n  - Inserter connections between storage and processing buildings\n  - Correct orientation of all components\n  - Proper spacing between entities\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Some mining drills are running out of fuel while others are operational\n- Implement consistent refueling system for all burner devices\n- Monitor fuel levels in all burner entities to prevent work stoppages"}
