{"content": "The error message indicates that the attempt to insert coal into the stone furnace failed because the furnace's inventory is full. This is a common issue when managing inventories in Factorio, as each entity has a limited capacity for items.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happened and how to address it:\n\n### What Happened:\n- **Attempted Action:** The code tried to insert 5 units of coal into the stone furnace.\n- **Error:** The furnace's inventory was already full, likely with copper ore and/or other items, preventing the insertion of additional coal.\n\n### Suggestions to Resolve the Issue:\n1. **Check Inventory Before Insertion:**\n   - Before inserting any items, inspect the furnace's inventory to determine available space.\n   - Use `inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)` to get the current inventory status.\n\n2. **Adjust Insertion Quantity:**\n   - If the inventory is nearly full, adjust the quantity of coal being inserted to fit the available space.\n   - Example: If only 2 slots are available, insert only 2 units of coal.\n\n3. **Extract Items if Necessary:**\n   - If the furnace is full of processed items like copper plates, extract them first to free up space.\n   - Use `extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, furnace_entity.position, quantity)` to remove items.\n\n4. **Monitor Inventory Levels:**\n   - Regularly check the inventory levels to ensure that the furnace is not overfilled, especially when automating processes.\n\n### Example Code Adjustments:\n```python\n# Step 1: Inspect the furnace inventory\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\n\n# Step 2: Determine available space for coal\navailable_space_for_coal = furnace_entity.get_free_slots(Prototype.Coal)\n\n# Step 3: Insert only the amount of coal that fits\nif available_space_for_coal > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace_entity, quantity=min(5, available_space_for_coal))\nelse:\n    print(\"No space available for coal insertion. Consider extracting items first.\")\n\n# Step 4: Extract copper plates if the furnace is full\nif furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0) > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, furnace_entity.position, furnace_inventory[Prototype.CopperPlate])\n```\n\nBy implementing these adjustments, you can better manage the inventory and avoid similar errors in the future.", "summary_range": "[1-162]"}
