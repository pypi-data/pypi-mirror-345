For example, the error regarding the lab indicates that there was no lab found at position (6.0, 0.0). Double-check the coordinates before attempting to access an entity.\n\n### Errors when using entities without power\n- Ensure that entities requiring power, such as labs and electric machines, are connected to a power source. The lab at position (10.5, 10.5) was reported as having no power.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
