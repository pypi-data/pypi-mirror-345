{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe recent attempts to check the crafting possibilities for Copper Plates have encountered some errors:\n\n### Observations from the Execution:\n1. **Copper Plate Recipe Status**:\n   - The recipe for **Copper Plates** indicates that it requires **1 Copper Ore** to produce **1 Copper Plate**. However, it seems that the recipe is marked as **disabled**, which means it cannot be used for crafting at this moment.\n   - This could be due to a lack of necessary infrastructure or an unavailability of required resources beyond just Copper Ore.\n\n2. **Error During Recipe Inspection**:\n   - An error occurred while trying to retrieve recipes for items that could utilize Copper Plates. Specifically, the system could not get the recipe for **express-inserter**, resulting in an exception.\n   - This suggests that there may be items in the prototype that either do not have defined recipes or the system is unable to access them correctly.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Infrastructure Requirements**: Investigate if there are any prerequisites for crafting items that require Copper Plates. This may include checking if specific machines or assembly lines are needed.\n2. **Review Available Recipes**: Instead of checking each item individually, I can focus on a subset of known items that typically utilize Copper Plates, such as electrical components or circuits.\n3. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling in the code to gracefully manage situations where recipes cannot be retrieved, allowing for a smoother workflow.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- I will focus on checking common items that typically require Copper Plates, such as:\n  - **Copper Cables**\n  - **Electronic Circuits**\n  - **Assembling Machines**\n  \nLet's proceed to check for specific recipes for these items and ensure we can utilize the Copper Plates effectively. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for specific recipes that require Copper Plates\ncommon_recipes = ['copper-cable', 'electronic-circuit', 'assembling-machine-1']  # Known items that typically use Copper Plates\navailable_recipes = {}\n\nfor item in common_recipes:\n    try:\n        recipe = get_prototype_recipe(item)\n        available_recipes[item] = recipe\n    except Exception as e:\n        available_recipes[item] = f\"Error retrieving recipe: {str(e)}\"\n\nprint(f\"Available recipes for common items using Copper Plates: {available_recipes}\")  # Display the recipes for known items.", "summary_range": "[1-428]"}
