{"content": "The error indicates that the attempt to harvest iron ore was unsuccessful because there was \"Nothing within reach to harvest.\" This typically occurs when the harvesting action is attempted without being properly positioned over the resource or if the resource is not accessible due to game mechanics.\n\n### Tips to Avoid This Error in the Future:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Positioning**: Before attempting to harvest, confirm that you are indeed standing directly over the resource patch. Use the bounding box information to verify that you're within the area of the resource.\n\n2. **Check Resource Availability**: Before harvesting, it can be helpful to inspect the resource patch to ensure that it has enough quantity available. This can prevent attempts to harvest when the resource is depleted or not accessible.\n\n3. **Use the Correct Harvesting Method**: Make sure that the method used to harvest is appropriate for the type of resource. In some cases, specific tools or equipment may be required to harvest certain resources.\n\n4. **Movement Confirmation**: After moving to the resource patch, it may be beneficial to confirm that the movement was successful before proceeding to harvest. This can be done by checking the current position against the expected position.\n\n5. **Adjust Harvesting Quantity**: If the resource patch is small or if there are limitations on how much can be harvested at once, consider reducing the quantity requested for harvesting.\n\n### Suggested Next Steps:\n\n1. **Recheck Position**: Move to the center of the iron ore patch again to ensure proper positioning.\n\n2. **Inspect Resource**: Before harvesting, inspect the resource to confirm its availability.\n\n3. **Harvest Again**: Attempt to harvest the iron ore again after confirming the above steps.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to avoid similar errors in the future and successfully harvest the resources needed for your crafting and automation processes.", "summary_range": "[1-132]"}
