Regularly check and replenish your coal supply to avoid production halts.\n\n### Furnace Production Stalls\n- Monitor the furnace inventory to ensure it contains sufficient iron ore and coal to maintain continuous production of iron plates. Regularly check and refill the furnace as needed.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent mining operations from stalling due to a full inventory. Consider expanding storage capacity or increasing the frequency of manual extractions.\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer materials between entities. Regularly verify the alignment and reposition if necessary to maintain efficient material flow.\n\n### Manual Extraction Inefficiencies\n- Automate the extraction and insertion processes as much as possible to minimize manual interventions and improve overall efficiency."}
