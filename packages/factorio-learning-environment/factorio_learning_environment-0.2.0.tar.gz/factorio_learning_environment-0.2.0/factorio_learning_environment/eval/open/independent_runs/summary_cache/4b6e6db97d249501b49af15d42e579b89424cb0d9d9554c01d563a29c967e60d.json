{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Out of fuel\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Resources: Iron ore (10,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (11 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Operations\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Incorrect Crafting Attempts\n- Coal is a raw resource and cannot be crafted. It must be gathered from the environment. Avoid attempting to craft coal.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Regularly check and ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can cause production halts.\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor and manage the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly extract resources to free up space.\n\n### Furnace Input Management\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Check inserter setups if the furnace is not receiving ore."}
