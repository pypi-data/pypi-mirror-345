{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (incomplete)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -2.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Connected to pipe network (fluid system 625) extending to (3.5, -1.5)\n- **Boiler** at (3.5, 0.0) facing UP (contains 48 coal)\n  - Has unconnected input pipe at (3.5, -1.5)\n  - Steam output not connected to steam engine\n- **Steam engine** at (6.5, 0.5) facing UP\n  - Not connected to boiler output\n  - Not connected to power network\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Water supply network** (fluid system 625)\n  - Runs from offshore pump through multiple pipes to (3.5, -1.5)\n- **Secondary pipe network** (fluid system 632)\n  - Unused pipes at (1.5, -0.5) and (1.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent fluid connection issues\n- Multiple failed attempts to connect boiler to steam engine due to:\n  - Incorrect orientation of connection points\n  - Attempting to connect water pipes to steam engine instead of boiler output\n  - Blocked connection points between pipes at (3.5, -1.5) and boiler\n\n### Specific connection problems\n- Cannot connect water directly to steam engine - must first pass through boiler\n- Ensure boiler steam output (facing UP) aligns with steam engine input\n- Verify pipe connections are complete before testing power generation\n\n### Placement recommendations\n- Check entity rotation before placement (boiler steam output must face steam engine)\n- Maintain proper spacing (3 tiles between boiler and steam engine)\n- Clear all obstructions between connection points before attempting connections\n\n### Fluid system troubleshooting\n- Confirm water reaches boiler before expecting steam production\n- Verify steam pipes connect boiler output to steam engine input only\n- Check that all connection points are unobstructed\n\n### Repeated error patterns\n- Multiple identical attempts to connect pipes at (3.5, -1.5) to boiler without fixing underlying issues\n- Continuing to try water connections to steam engine despite error messages"}
