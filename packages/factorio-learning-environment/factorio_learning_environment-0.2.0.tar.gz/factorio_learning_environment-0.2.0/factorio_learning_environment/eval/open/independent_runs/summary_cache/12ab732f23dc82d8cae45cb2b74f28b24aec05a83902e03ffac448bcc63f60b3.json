{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests for storage at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5), (8.5, 1.5), (17.5, 1.5), (19.5, 1.5).\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), (20.5, 0.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 17.5).\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 22.0) with no fuel.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5).\n- PipeGroup connecting the Boiler and Steam Engine.\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with no research in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are correctly aligned and within the connection range. Verify that there are no obstructions or incorrect connections between the boiler and the steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) have the necessary items for the inserters to pick up. Ensure that the inserters are correctly positioned and oriented to transfer items between entities.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt. Check the supply lines and inserters to verify that they are correctly feeding the furnaces with the necessary raw materials.\n\n### Errors with Boilers Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the boilers to maintain a consistent energy supply. Monitor the fuel levels and automate the refueling process if possible to prevent energy shortages."}
