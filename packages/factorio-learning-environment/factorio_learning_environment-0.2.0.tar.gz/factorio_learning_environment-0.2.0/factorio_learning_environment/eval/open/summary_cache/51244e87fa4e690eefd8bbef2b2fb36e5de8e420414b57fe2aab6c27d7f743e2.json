{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with full output inventory and source inventory frequently full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage and input/output buffers for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- The structure facilitates iron ore extraction, smelting, and iron plate storage, with frequent manual inventory transfers observed to manage iron plate flow. Output belt blockage at furnace remains unresolved, causing mining drill to wait.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5) forming an extended power network.\n\nThis structure generates electricity from steam power but requires refueling of the boiler to maintain operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to the electric network.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates to the assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) for assembled items.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Despite repeated insertion of iron plates into input chest and assembler, the assembling machine input and output inventories remain empty or inconsistent, indicating intermittent or incomplete material flow.\n- The assembling machine reports shortage of iron plates preventing crafting iron gear wheels.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failure to place small electric poles near steam engine and furnace due to tile occupancy by existing entities or terrain (water).\n- To avoid these errors, verify tile occupancy and terrain suitability before placement.\n- Adjust placement parameters such as spacing, direction, or reference position to find valid placement tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters occasionally wait for source items, indicating supply chain interruptions.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel and source inventories to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) remains unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates despite repeated attempts to insert iron plates into input chest and assembler.\n- Assembling machine input and output inventories often empty, suggesting issues with item transfer or inserter operation.\n- Ensure reliable and continuous supply of iron plates to assembler input.\n- Verify inserter directions and connections between chests and assembler to prevent item flow interruptions.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage and waiting status.\n- Stone furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, stopping steam production and potentially reducing power output.\n- Power network extended with new poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5), improving connectivity.\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items.\n- Regularly refuel boilers to maintain steam power generation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo new user-defined functions have been defined in the recent steps."}
