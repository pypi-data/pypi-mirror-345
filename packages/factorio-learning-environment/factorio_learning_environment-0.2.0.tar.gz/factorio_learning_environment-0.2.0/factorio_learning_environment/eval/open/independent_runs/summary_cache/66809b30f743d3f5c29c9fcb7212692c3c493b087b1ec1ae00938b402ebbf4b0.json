{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures built on the map. The logs indicate that the agent has not successfully placed any entities or structures yet. The map remains empty of any constructed entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place a Wooden Chest**: The agent attempted to place a wooden chest at various coordinates (e.g., x=30.0 y=30.0, x=40.5 y=-82.5, x=50.0 y=-90.0, x=0.0 y=0.0, x=100.0 y=-150.0) but was unsuccessful. Ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another entity or obstructed by terrain. Verify that the placement is within the buildable area and adheres to any global build restrictions.\n\n- **Cannot place a Transport Belt**: Similar issues were encountered when attempting to place transport belts at coordinates (e.g., x=45.0 y=-85.0, x=65.0 y=-105.0). Check that the intended path for the transport belt is clear of obstacles and that the belt can connect to existing structures if necessary.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Inventory Management**: Regularly check the inventory to ensure that there are enough resources and entities available for construction. The logs show consistent inventory checks, which is a good practice.\n- **Map Awareness**: Before placing entities, ensure that the map is checked for existing entities and obstacles. This can prevent placement errors and optimize the layout of structures."}
