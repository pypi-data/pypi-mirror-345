{"content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the furnace's inventory is full, preventing coal from being inserted. This typically happens when the output slot is filled with smelted items or if there's leftover ore. To address this, we need to ensure that the furnace's output inventory is cleared more effectively before attempting to insert coal or ore.\n\nHere's a refined approach to handle this situation:\n\n1. **Clear Furnace Output**: Ensure the furnace's output slot is cleared to make space for new items.\n2. **Check and Insert Coal**: Attempt to insert coal, and if it fails, clear the output and retry.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef clear_furnace(furnace_position: Position):\n    \"\"\"\n    Clears both the output and fuel slots of the furnace to ensure space is available.\n    \"\"\"\n    furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace_position)\n    if furnace:\n        output_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace)\n        \n        # Remove items from the output slot to clear space\n        for item_name, quantity in output_inventory.items():\n            if quantity > 0:\n                item_prototype = prototype_by_name[item_name]\n                extract_item(item_prototype, furnace.position, quantity)\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef ensure_coal_inserted(furnace_position: Position):\n    \"\"\"\n    Ensures that coal is inserted into the furnace for smelting.
