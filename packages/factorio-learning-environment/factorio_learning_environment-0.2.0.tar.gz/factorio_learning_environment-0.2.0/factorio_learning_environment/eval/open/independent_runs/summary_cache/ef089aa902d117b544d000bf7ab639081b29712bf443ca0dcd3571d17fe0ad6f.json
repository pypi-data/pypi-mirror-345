{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. The agent has not successfully placed any entities such as Burner Mining Drills or Stone Furnaces, as indicated by the repeated error messages and the lack of updated entities on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is a valid, unoccupied tile before attempting to place a Burner Mining Drill or Stone Furnace. The repeated errors indicate attempts to place these entities at occupied or invalid locations.\n\n### Errors related to finding buildable spots\n- When attempting to place a Burner Mining Drill, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. Consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if no viable spot is found.\n\n### Errors with movement commands\n- When using the `move_to` command, ensure that the position indices are integers. The error suggests that string indices were used, which is incorrect.\n\n### Undefined variable errors\n- Before using variables in conditions or operations, ensure they are defined. The error indicates that 'furnace' was used without being defined, suggesting a need to check variable initialization and scope.\n\n### General placement strategy\n- Re-evaluate the approach to finding viable buildable areas. If entities cannot be placed, consider adjusting the strategy for selecting positions or the method for determining buildable areas."}
