{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (19.5, -1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Inserter Setup at Position (-3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (-2.5, 1.5), (-2.5, 0.5), (-2.5, 2.5), (-3.5, 2.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -12.5) with fluid system 5226\n- PipeGroup at Position (5.5, -8.5) with fluid system 5227\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -2.5) with fluid system 5237\n- PipeGroup at Position (18.5, -3.5) with fluid system 5233\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (-2.5, 2.5) and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities with Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are correctly aligned and within reach of each other. Verify that there are no obstacles or incorrect positions that might prevent a successful connection.\n\n### Errors When Retrieving Entities\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the entity type exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors related to non-existent entities at given positions.\n\n### Errors Due to Unconnected Fluid Systems\n- Verify that all components of a fluid system (e.g., offshore pumps, boilers, steam engines) are correctly connected with pipes to ensure fluid flow. Check for any missing or misaligned connections that could disrupt the system."}
