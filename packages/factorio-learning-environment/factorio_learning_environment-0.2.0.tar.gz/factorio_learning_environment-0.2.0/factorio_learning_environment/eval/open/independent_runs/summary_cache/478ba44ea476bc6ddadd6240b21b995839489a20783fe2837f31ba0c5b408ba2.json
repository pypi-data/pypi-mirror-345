failure to do so (e.g. player reported at (0,0)) can cause distance errors exceeding the maximum allowed.\n\u2003\u2013 When initial placement fails due to distance constraints, force relocation and allow time for game state updates before reattempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Boiler Placement and Buildability:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that the target tile is free of obstructions and water overlaps; repeated \u201ccan_place_entity returned False\u201d messages indicate the selected candidate positions are not buildable.\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-check the buildability of the placement area to avoid errors such as overlapping water or invalid surfaces.\n\n\u2022 Fluid and Pipe Connection Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that both source and target connection points (e.g. Offshore Pump and Boiler) are accessible and within the allowed proximity for pipe connections.\n\u2003\u2013 When intermediate candidates are computed for pipe linking, verify that each candidate position is buildable and unobstructed.\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor inventory levels; errors citing insufficient pipe inventory (e.g. required 16, available 14) suggest the need to stock additional pipes before attempting segmented connections.\n\n\u2022 Entity Retrieval and Repositioning:\n\u2003\u2013 After picking up an entity for repositioning, ensure it is successfully removed from the map before trying to place it again.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that the entity is correctly reinserted in a suitable and accessible tile to prevent cascading placement errors."}
