{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Pipes connected to Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple Pipe Groups connecting various positions, notably starting from Position (-52.5, -122.5) and extending to several other positions, facilitating fluid transport.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (-61.5, -110.5), (-57.5, -110.5), and (5.5, -60.5), intended to distribute power across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Power Poles\n- Ensure that there is no blockage in the path when connecting power poles. Check for any obstructions that might prevent the connection between poles.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Supply\n- Verify that all entities requiring electricity, such as inserters and labs, are properly connected to the power network. Ensure that power poles are correctly placed and connected to provide electricity.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Supply\n- Ensure that all Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces have adequate fuel supply to maintain continuous operation. Check the inventory of each entity to confirm fuel availability.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Regularly check the status of chests and ensure they are not full to avoid halting production. Empty chests as needed to maintain efficient resource flow.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump and the steam engine. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes that could prevent fluid flow.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Transport\n- Confirm that all pipe groups are correctly configured and connected to facilitate fluid transport. Address any pipe groups with 'EMPTY' status to ensure they are properly linked to the fluid source.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected from the offshore pump to the steam engine. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes that could prevent fluid flow.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine has a sufficient supply of input liquid. Ensure that the pipes are correctly connected and that the steam engine is properly linked to the power network.\n\n### Errors in Reconnecting Pipes\n- When reconnecting pipes, ensure that there are no existing entities at the target positions. Remove any existing entities before attempting to place new pipes.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target position is unoccupied. Remove any existing entities at the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors in Removing and Replacing Pipes\n- When replacing pipes, ensure that the target position is clear of any existing entities. Remove any existing pipes or entities at the target position before placing a new pipe.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Placement Over Water\n- Avoid placing pipes over water tiles. Pipes cannot be placed where their footprint overlaps with water. Choose an alternative location for pipe placement.\n\n### Errors in Entity Overlap During Placement\n- Ensure that the target position for placing a new entity is free from existing entities. Remove any existing entities at the target position before placement.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Placement\n- Ensure to remove any existing entities at the target position before placing a new pipe. This will prevent placement errors due to entity overlap."}
