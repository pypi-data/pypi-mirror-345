{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5)\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient fuel\n- Ensure that the Burner Mining Drill and Stone Furnace are adequately fueled before operation. Check the inventory of connected chests for available fuel.\n\n### Errors when extracting from the Wooden Chest\n- Ensure that there are sufficient items in the Wooden Chest before attempting to extract. If the inventory shows \"No Coal available\" or \"No Iron Ore available,\" check the inventory status.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for items\n- If a Burner Inserter is in a \"WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\" state, verify that the source chest has the required items. If it is \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION,\" ensure that the destination entity has space available.\n\n### Errors when trying to insert into a non-functional entity\n- If the Stone Furnace or any other entity shows \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" or \"NO_FUEL,\" it will not accept items. Ensure the entity is operational before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Repeated errors with burner mining drills\n- The Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) has been consistently reported as \"NO_FUEL.\" Regularly monitor and refuel this entity to maintain its operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n- `stone-plate`: int (not explicitly mentioned but inferred from context)"}
