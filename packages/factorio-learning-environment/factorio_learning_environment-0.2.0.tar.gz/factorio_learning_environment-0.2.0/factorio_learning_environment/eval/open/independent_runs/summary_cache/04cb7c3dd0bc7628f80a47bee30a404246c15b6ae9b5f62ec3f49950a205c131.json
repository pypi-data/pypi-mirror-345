{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of:\n- Cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n- New factory burner inserter placed at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) using direction RIGHT\n- Auxiliary factory burner inserter retrieved at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5)\n- Assembling machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5)\nUse-case: Facilitates copper plate processing into copper cable.\n\n### Wooden Chest Belt Depot at Position (3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest serving as the belt depot at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\n- Dedicated transport belt segment placed at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) adjacent to the chest\n- Depot burner inserter placed at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) using direction UP\nUse-case: Acts as an isolated target for multi-segment belt routing from the extraction system.\n\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n- Transport Belt Connection Errors:\n  \u2022 When connecting transport belts, ensure the target is not a Prototype.SteamEngine. Use an inserter as an intermediary to input items into the engine.\n\n- Placement Range Error:\n  \u2022 Confirm the player is within the maximum allowed distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n- Inventory Shortage Error:\n  \u2022 Verify that the required item (e.g., wooden chest) is present in the inventory prior to placement.\n\n- Undefined Variable Error:\n  \u2022 Check that all variables (such as 'target_chest') are correctly defined and assigned before use to avoid reference errors."}
