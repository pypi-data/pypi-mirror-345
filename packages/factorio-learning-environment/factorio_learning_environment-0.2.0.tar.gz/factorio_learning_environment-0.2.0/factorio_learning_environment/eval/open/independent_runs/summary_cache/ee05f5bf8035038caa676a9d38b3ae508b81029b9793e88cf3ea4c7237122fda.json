{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Mining and Collection Setup at Position (41.5, -83.5)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -86.0): Extracts coal and drops it onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (41.5, -84.5): Transports coal from the mining drill to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -83.5): Collects coal from the transport belt.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5): Additional storage for collected resources.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0): Used for smelting operations, currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before placing entities like **burner-inserters**, **wooden-chests**, or **transport-belts**. Repeated attempts to place entities on occupied tiles caused multiple errors.\n\n#### Errors when inspecting non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity (e.g., **wooden-chest**) before attempting to inspect its inventory. Attempting to inspect a cleared or non-existent entity resulted in errors.\n\n#### Errors when replacing transport belts\n- Clear the existing transport belt before placing a new one. Attempting to place a transport belt on an occupied tile caused placement failures.\n\n#### General Tips\n- Always check for existing entities at the target position before placing new ones.\n- Use the `clear_entity` function to remove obstacles before placing new entities.\n- Ensure entities like **burner-inserters** and **wooden-chests** are placed in valid, unoccupied positions."}
