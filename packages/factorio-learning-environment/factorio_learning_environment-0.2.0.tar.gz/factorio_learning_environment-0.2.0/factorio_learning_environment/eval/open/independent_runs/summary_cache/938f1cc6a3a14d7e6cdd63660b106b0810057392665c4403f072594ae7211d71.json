{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the wooden chest and furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items.\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Processing\n- Wooden Chests at various positions storing different resources such as copper plates, iron plates, and coal.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (-21.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Finding Nearest Entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists on the map before attempting to find its nearest instance. This will prevent errors like \"Could not find nearest iron-plate on the surface.\"\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Verify that the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting to place it. This will avoid errors such as \"Could not place wooden-chest at (-15.5, -69.5), No wooden_chest in inventory.\"\n\n### Errors with Misaligned Inserters\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. This will prevent issues like picking up misaligned inserters."}
