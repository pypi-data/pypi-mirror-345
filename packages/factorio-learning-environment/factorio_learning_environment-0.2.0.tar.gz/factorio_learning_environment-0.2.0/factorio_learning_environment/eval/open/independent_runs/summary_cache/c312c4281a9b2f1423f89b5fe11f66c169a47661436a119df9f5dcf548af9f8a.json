Use proper attribute or method calls (for example, ensure that the center of a buildable area is accessed correctly).\n\u2003\u2013 Repositioning trials using candidate locations (e.g. at (-8.5, 24.0), (-7.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 24.5), (-6.5, 23.5) or (-3.5, 24.0)) have repeatedly failed due to the spots being unbuildable. Pre-validate candidate positions for buildability before attempting placement.\n\u2003\n\u2022 CONNECTION FAILURES:\n\u2003\u2013 When connecting a Steam Engine (e.g. from (-14.5, 15.5)) to a Boiler (at -5.5, 24.0), valid connection points must be available and unobstructed on both entities. Verify that neither endpoint has nearby blocking objects and that the fluid system can be linked.\n\u2003\n\u2022 RESOURCE, POWER & FUEL DELIVERY:\n\u2003\u2013 Furnaces and boilers require a continuous supply of ingredients and fuel. Monitor fuel levels closely and address \u201cNO_FUEL\u201d conditions promptly by ensuring adequate fuel availability.\n\u2003\n\u2022 CRAFTING CHAIN & INVENTORY VERIFICATION:\n\u2003\u2013 Before executing placement actions, confirm that the crafted entity is present in inventory to avoid inventory-related errors.\n\u2003\n\u2022 UNDERGROUND PIPE & CONNECTION VALIDATION:\n\u2003\u2013 For pipe-based connections, pre-validate target tile availability and ensure that source and target connection points are compatible and free from obstructions.\n\u2003\n\u2022 MIXED CONNECTION ERRORS:\n\u2003\u2013 Repeated connection failures may be due to overlapping placement or incompatible connection types. Reassess connection strategies and adjust spacing or orientation as needed."}
