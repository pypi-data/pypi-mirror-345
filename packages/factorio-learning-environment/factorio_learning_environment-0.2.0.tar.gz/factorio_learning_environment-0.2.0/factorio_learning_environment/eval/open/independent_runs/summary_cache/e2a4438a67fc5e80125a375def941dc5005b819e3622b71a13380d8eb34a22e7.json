{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5)\n- Small electric poles (multiple positions including -11.5, 26.5 and others)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is properly connected to the boiler and steam engine by checking for any placement blockages before attempting to connect. Clear any obstructing pipes that may prevent connections.\n- Verify that the entities are within the connection range of each other. If they are too far apart, the connection will fail.\n\n### Errors when using electric networks\n- Make sure to connect all electric entities to the power network. Check the status of each electric pole and ensure they are within range of the electricity group. If they are not connected, reposition them as necessary.\n\n### Errors when inspecting fluid connections\n- When inspecting fluid connections, ensure that the offshore pump has access to a fluid source. If there are warnings about \"no fluid present in connections,\" check the connections and ensure they are properly set up to receive fluids."}
