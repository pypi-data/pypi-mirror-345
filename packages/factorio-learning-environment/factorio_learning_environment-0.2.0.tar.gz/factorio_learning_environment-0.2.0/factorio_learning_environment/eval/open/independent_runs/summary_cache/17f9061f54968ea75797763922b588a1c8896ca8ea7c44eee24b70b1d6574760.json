Recently refueled with 20 units of coal (status: FULL_OUTPUT; fuel inventory now {'coal': 18}).\n\u2003 - Extra Steam Engine at (11.5, 18.5): Initially placed at (12.5, 18.5) and subsequently repositioned (target buildable area centered at (11.5, 18.0)) in several attempts to improve pipe connectivity. Despite multiple repositionings\u2014including attempted manual placement at (9.0, 20.5) and an alternative placement at (9.0, 19.0)\u2014pipe connection to the boiler has not been established (status remains NOT_CONNECTED, energy 0.0).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Pipe Connection Failures:\n\u2003 - Repeated failures when connecting the boiler at (8.0, 20.5) to the extra steam engine at (11.5, 18.5) indicate that connection points may be obstructed or misaligned. Ensure that both entities have clear, unobstructed connection interfaces and that no spatial blockages exist along the pipe route.\n\n\u2022 Manual Placement and Inventory Shortfalls:\n\u2003 - The exact placement attempt at (9.0, 20.5) was aborted because the designated tile was not buildable. Validate that the target position is free before manual placement.\n\u2003 - An alternative placement failure occurred due to the absence of a steam engine in inventory. Confirm inventory levels prior to placement operations.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Failures Due to Sub-Ingredient Shortages:\n\u2003 - A replacement steam engine couldn\u2019t be crafted because essential sub-ingredients (for example, iron-plate needed for iron-gear-wheel production) were missing, and production facilities (furnaces or crafting machines) were not available to process them. Verify the availability of both sub-ingredients and functional production machinery before initiating craft routines.\n\n\u2022 Historical Extra Steam Engine Placement Considerations:\n\u2003 - When spatial congestion prevents proper placement, consider repositioning or clearing conflicting entities (such as overlapping burner\u2011inserters and transport belts) to secure a viable buildable area.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nget_connection_amount(boiler: Entity, extra_se: Entity, connection_type: Prototype) -> int\n\u2003 - Determines the required number of pipes to connect the boiler to the extra steam engine. On failure (due to spatial or connectivity issues), an exception is raised.\n\nplace_entity(entity_type: Prototype, position: Position, direction: Direction) -> Entity\n\u2003 - Attempts to place an entity of the specified type at the given position with the indicated orientation. Fails with an error if the intended tile is occupied or if the inventory does not supply the required item.\n\ncraft_item(item: Prototype, quantity: int) -> int\n\u2003 - Initiates crafting for the specified item and quantity, returning the number of items successfully crafted. Throws an exception if necessary sub-ingredients or appropriate production facilities are unavailable.\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 inventory: dict[str, int] \u2014 Represents the current inventory of items.\n\u2022 boiler: Entity \u2014 Refers to the boiler located at (8.0, 20.5).\n\u2022 extra_se: Entity \u2014 Denotes the extra steam engine currently positioned at (11.5, 18.5).\n\u2022 new_buildable_area: BuildableArea \u2014 Object used to determine available buildable regions via its center property."}
