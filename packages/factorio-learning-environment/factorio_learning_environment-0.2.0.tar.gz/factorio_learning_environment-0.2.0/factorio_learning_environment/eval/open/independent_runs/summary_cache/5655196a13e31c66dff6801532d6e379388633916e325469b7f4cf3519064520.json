{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(1, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (1.0, 1.0))\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at positions (6.5, 4.5), (2.5, 1.5), (2.5, 2.5), (1.5, 3.5)\n\n### Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (status: NO_POWER, research: automation)\n\n### Wooden chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5), inventory: {'iron-plate': 20})\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 3.5), inventory: {'iron-plate': 50})\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 5.5), inventory: {})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure you have all required materials before attempting to craft an item. For example, you need iron-gear-wheels to craft an Assembling Machine.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to technology requirements\n- Research the necessary technology before attempting to craft items that require it, such as the Assembling Machine which requires automation technology.\n\n### Errors related to missing entities\n- Check the map for the presence of required entities, such as steam engines or solar panels, before attempting to reference them."}
