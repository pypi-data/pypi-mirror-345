{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a fuel inventory of 2 coal. The drill is currently working but has a warning: \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -47.0) with a fuel inventory of 4 coal. The furnace has a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt\" and is currently not processing any items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -49.5) with a fuel inventory of 3 coal. The inserter is waiting for source items and is responsible for transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of 4 coal. The furnace has a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt\" and contains 2 iron plates in its result inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Crafting without Required Resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting a burner mining drill requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Available Inventory\n- Confirm that the inventory contains the items you intend to insert into another entity. For instance, ensure you have iron ore available before attempting to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when Crafting Items with Missing Sub-Ingredients\n- Check that all sub-ingredients for crafting are available or can be crafted. For example, iron plates must be smelted in a furnace, and stone is a raw resource that must be gathered before crafting a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors due to Output Blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage and maintain continuous operation."}
