{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the current state report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup (around x=43, y=-84)\n- Burner mining drill at (43.0, -84.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (43.5, -82.5) collecting coal output\n- Feed inserter at (47.5, -83.5)\nCurrent status: Working but chest is full with 48 coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (around x=-14, y=-53)\n- Burner mining drill at (-16.0, -53.0) mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -52.5) to transfer ore to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-13.0, -53.0) for smelting\n- Output wooden chest at (-11.5, -52.5)\nCurrent status: Drill waiting for space, furnace has no ingredients\n\n### Standalone Furnace (x=4, y=-60)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, -60.0)\nCurrent status: No ingredients to smelt\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing inserters next to entities, consider:\n  - Increasing spacing parameter if target position is occupied\n  - Checking different directions if current direction is blocked\n  - Verifying reference position is correct\n  - Ensuring no other entities block the target position\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available before attempting to insert into machines\n- Monitor chest capacity - full chests block mining operations\n- Clear blocked resources on ground before continuing operations\n\n### Variable Reference Errors\n- Define all required variables before use\n- Double check variable names match exactly (e.g., coal_chest vs chest confusion)\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before crafting\n- For items requiring furnace smelting, use appropriate production facilities instead of manual crafting\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to(entity, position, direction, spacing): Places an entity relative to reference position\n- extract_item(prototype, source, quantity): Extracts items from source entity\n- insert_item(prototype, target, quantity): Inserts items into target entity\n\nImportant Variables:\n- coal_drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- feed_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- ore_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- plate_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- output_chest: Chest"}
