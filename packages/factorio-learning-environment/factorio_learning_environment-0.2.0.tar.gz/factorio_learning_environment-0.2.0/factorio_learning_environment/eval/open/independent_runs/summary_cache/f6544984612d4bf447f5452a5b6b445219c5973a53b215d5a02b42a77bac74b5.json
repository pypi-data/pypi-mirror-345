{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: 4 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Connected to a stone furnace\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place a new entity. This applies to Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors related to missing entities\n- Verify the presence of the required entity at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. This includes checking for Stone Furnaces at specified coordinates.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Make sure there is a sink entity or a clear path for the output of the mining drill to prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors when refueling or interacting with entities\n- Confirm you are interacting with the correct entity and that it is within range for actions like refueling or extracting items."}
