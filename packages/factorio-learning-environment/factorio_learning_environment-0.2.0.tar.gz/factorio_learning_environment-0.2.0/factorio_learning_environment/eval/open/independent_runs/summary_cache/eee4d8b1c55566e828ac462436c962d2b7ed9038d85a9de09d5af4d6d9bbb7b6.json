{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with a current status of EntityStatus.WORKING and containing 0 copper-ore.\n\n### Wooden chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) containing 50 iron-plates.\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 3.5)) containing 50 iron-plates.\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 5.5)) with an empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting copper ore from the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace contains copper-ore before attempting to extract it. The error indicates that the furnace at (1.0, 1.0) did not have a valid copper-ore entity.\n\n### Errors when crafting Automation Science Packs\n- Ensure you have enough copper plates in your inventory before attempting to craft Automation Science Packs. The current status indicates that there are not enough copper plates available.\n\n### Errors when placing items into the furnace\n- Make sure the furnace is available and in a working state before inserting items. The current status of the furnace should be checked to confirm it can accept items.\n\n### Repeated errors related to copper ore extraction and insertion\n- The furnace at (1.0, 1.0) has a consistent issue of not producing copper plates. Verify the input materials and ensure the furnace is functioning correctly to avoid repeated extraction and insertion attempts without results.\n\n### Errors related to furnace output\n- The furnace at (1.0, 1.0) is not producing copper plates despite having copper ore. Check the furnace's configuration and ensure it is set up correctly to produce the desired output.\n\n### Errors from excessive copper ore insertion\n- The furnace at (1.0, 1.0) has been repeatedly fed copper ore without producing any output. Verify the furnace's processing capabilities and ensure it is configured correctly to avoid unnecessary insertions."}
