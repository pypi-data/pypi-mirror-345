{"content": "## Summary of Actions and Errors\n\n### Actions Attempted:\n1. **Gathering Resources**: Successfully collected 5 units of iron ore and 5 units of coal.\n2. **Crafting a Stone Furnace**: Attempted to craft a Stone Furnace using the command `craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, quantity=1)`.\n\n### Error Encountered:\n- The crafting of the Stone Furnace failed due to the absence of the required intermediate resource, stone. The error message indicated that stone is a raw resource that must be gathered before crafting the furnace.\n\n## Tips and Logic Patterns to Avoid Future Errors\n\n### 1. **Resource Gathering**:\n   - **Always Check Required Resources**: Before attempting to craft an item, ensure that all required resources are available in your inventory. This includes not just the primary materials but also any intermediate resources that may be needed.\n   - **Use `get_prototype_recipe()`**: Utilize this function to check the recipe for the item you want to craft. This will provide a clear list of all required ingredients, including any intermediate materials.\n\n### 2. **Crafting Order**:\n   - **Gather All Necessary Resources First**: If an item requires multiple resources, gather them all before attempting to craft. In this case, I should have gathered stone before trying to craft the Stone Furnace.\n   - **Recursive Crafting**: If an item requires other crafted items, implement a function to recursively ensure that all necessary materials are available. This can help automate the process of checking and crafting intermediate items.\n\n### 3. **Error Handling**:\n   - **Implement Checks Before Crafting**: Before executing a crafting command, check if all required resources are present. If not, prompt for gathering those resources first.\n   - **Use Try/Except Blocks**: Wrap crafting attempts in try/except blocks to handle errors gracefully and provide informative feedback about what went wrong.\n\n### 4. **Common Antipatterns to Avoid**:\n   - **Crafting Without Complete Inventory**: Avoid attempting to craft items without verifying the complete inventory of required resources. This leads to unnecessary errors and wasted attempts.\n   - **Ignoring Intermediate Requirements**: Do not overlook the need for intermediate resources. Always account for them in your crafting plans.\n\nBy following these guidelines, I can streamline my resource management and crafting processes, reducing the likelihood of encountering similar errors in the future.", "summary_range": "[1-34]"}
