{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between chests, with a pickup position at (-13.5, -53.5) and a drop position at (-13.5, -55.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5) for storing copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -84.5).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Transport and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storing different resources such as iron ore, copper ore, and coal.\n- Belt Groups connecting various parts of the facility, facilitating the movement of resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Drop Position Mismatch\n- Ensure that the inserter's drop position matches the target chest's position to avoid misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Callable Objects\n- Avoid treating non-callable objects like 'Chest' as callable. Ensure correct usage of methods and attributes associated with objects.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up to prevent them from waiting indefinitely.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Monitor and empty chests regularly to prevent overflow and ensure continuous resource collection and processing."}
