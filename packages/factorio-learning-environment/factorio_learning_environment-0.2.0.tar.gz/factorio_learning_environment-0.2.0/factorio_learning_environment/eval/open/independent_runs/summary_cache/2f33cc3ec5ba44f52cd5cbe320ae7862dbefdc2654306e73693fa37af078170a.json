{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the inserter's alignment and reposition if necessary to maintain efficient transfer of resources.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. Ensure you have the required resources, such as coal, to fuel machines and inserters. This will prevent errors related to insufficient resources for operations.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly configured to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for any misalignment or blockages that might prevent the transfer of resources to the furnace."}
