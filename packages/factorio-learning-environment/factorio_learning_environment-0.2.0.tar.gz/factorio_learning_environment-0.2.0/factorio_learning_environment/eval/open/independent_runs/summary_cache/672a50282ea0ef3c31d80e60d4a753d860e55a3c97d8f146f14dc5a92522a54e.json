{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently processing iron ore into iron plates. It has a fuel inventory containing coal and a source inventory containing iron ore.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is extracting coal. It has a fuel inventory containing coal and is connected to a wooden chest for resource drop-off.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which is receiving coal from the burner mining drill.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace without sufficient inventory**\n  - Ensure you have enough iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. Check your inventory status regularly.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Move closer to the target entity where you want to extract from before executing the extraction command.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item(item_type, target_entity, quantity)`: Used to insert items into a target entity. \n    - Failure Mode: Fails if there are insufficient items in the inventory.\n    - Success Mode: Successfully inserts items if inventory conditions are met.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary containing items and their counts (type: dict).\n  - `furnace`: Reference to the furnace entity (type: entity).\n  - `nearest_iron_ore_position`: Tuple representing the coordinates of the nearest iron ore (type: tuple)."}
