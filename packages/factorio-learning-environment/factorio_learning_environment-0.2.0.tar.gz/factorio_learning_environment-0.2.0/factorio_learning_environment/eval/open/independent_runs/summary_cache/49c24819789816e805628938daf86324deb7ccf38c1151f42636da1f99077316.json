{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) connected to wooden chests at Positions (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5) storing coal\n- Burner Inserter at Position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) transferring items to a chest at Position (x=56.5, y=-83.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at Positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing coal and iron plates\n\n### Laboratory\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Copper Smelting Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup and individual belts facilitating the movement of coal and other resources\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items into Full Inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. Consider using additional storage chests or managing inventory levels to prevent overfilling.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a power network. Check that the steam engine is properly connected to the power grid.\n\n### Errors Related to Mining Drill Output\n- Regularly check and empty the chests connected to mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
