{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5)\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (5.5, -60.5)\n  - (7.5, -60.5)\n  - (6.5, -60.5)\n  - (9.5, -60.5)\n  - (8.5, -60.5)\n  - (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore\n  - (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0) with a status of WORKING\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- The burner mining drill is unable to continue mining because the chest at the drop position (4.5, -58.5) is full. Ensure to regularly empty the chest to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnace\n- The furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) are not operational due to a lack of ingredients. Ensure to supply these furnaces with the necessary raw materials to keep them functioning.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n- `iron-plate`: int = 4590\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int = 4"}
