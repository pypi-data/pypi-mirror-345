{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Pipe connections between the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Storage Units\n- Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups in various positions, currently empty and not connected to any fluid systems\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles in various positions, not successfully connected to the power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting to Power Network\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network. This includes having enough small electric poles.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items into Entities\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces. For example, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors with Fuel and Ingredients\n- Regularly check and refill fuel for entities like burner mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel.\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning.\n\n### Errors with Entity Connections\n- Make sure all necessary connections, such as pipes and electric poles, are properly established and connected to their respective networks to avoid warnings like \"no fluid present in connections\" or \"not connected to power network.\""}
