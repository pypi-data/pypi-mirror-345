{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at (-82.0, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -80.0) facing UP\n\nThe system appears to be a coal mining and transport setup, but is currently experiencing blockages and alignment issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Placement and Rotation Issues\n- Ensure furnace placement coordinates align exactly with inserter drop positions\n- When placing furnaces, account for their 2x2 size and ensure proper alignment with belts and inserters\n- Clear any blocked belts or items on ground before attempting to place new structures\n- Some entities like stone-furnace may have rotation restrictions - verify valid rotation directions before attempting to rotate\n\n### Belt and Inserter Flow Issues\n- Ensure there is proper space for items to move through the transport system\n- Clear blocked belts before rebuilding connected structures\n- Make sure there are appropriate sink entities to accept outputs from inserters\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor chest capacity to prevent mining blockages\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ingredients before expecting them to operate\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- rotate_entity(entity, direction): Attempts to rotate an entity to specified direction. Can fail if entity doesn't support requested rotation.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace: EntityRef (Stone Furnace)\n- belt: EntityRef (Transport Belt)\n- inserter: EntityRef (Burner Inserter)\n\nThe agent appears to be working on optimizing a production line but is struggling with precise entity placement and material flow management."}
