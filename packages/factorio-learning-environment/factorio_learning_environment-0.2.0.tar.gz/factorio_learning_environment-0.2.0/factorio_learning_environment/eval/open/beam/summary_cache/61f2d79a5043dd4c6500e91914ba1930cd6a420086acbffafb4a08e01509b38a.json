{"content": "The error message indicates that the attempt to place a small electric pole failed because the target position was too far from the player's current position. In Factorio, entities can only be placed within a certain range from the player, so you need to move closer to the desired placement location before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Move Closer to Target Position**: Before placing an entity, ensure the player is within the allowable placement range of the target position.\n\n2. **Re-attempt Placement**: Once in range, attempt to place the electric pole again.\n\nHere's how you can adjust the code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Define positions for extending the electric network\npole_extension_positions = [Position(x=-13.0, y=24.5), Position(x=-15.0, y=24.0)]\n\n# Move to each position and place the electric pole\nfor extension_position in pole_extension_positions:\n    # Move closer to the target position\n    move_to(extension_position)\n    # Check if the player is within the placement range\n    current_position = get_player_position()\n    distance_to_target = calculate_distance(current_position, extension_position)\n    \n    if distance_to_target <= 10:\n        # Place the electric pole if within range\n        place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=extension_position)\n        print(f\"Extended electric pole network at: {extension_position}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Cannot place electric pole at {extension_position}, too far from current position {current_position}\")\n\n# Verify inventory status after attempting to extend the network\ninventory_check_after_extension = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Inventory After Electrical Network Extension: {inventory_check_after_extension}\")\n\n# Review all entities to confirm their operational status with new connections\nfactory_entities_check_power = get_entities()\nfor entity in factory_entities_check_power:\n    print(f\"Entity: {entity.name} at {entity.position}, status: {entity.status}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Proximity Requirement**: Always ensure the player is within the maximum placement range of the target position.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement checks to avoid repeated errors by verifying distance before attempting placement.\n- **Iterative Approach**: Move and place entities iteratively to ensure each step is within the allowable range.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully place the electric poles and power the inserters.", "summary_range": "[1-164]"}
