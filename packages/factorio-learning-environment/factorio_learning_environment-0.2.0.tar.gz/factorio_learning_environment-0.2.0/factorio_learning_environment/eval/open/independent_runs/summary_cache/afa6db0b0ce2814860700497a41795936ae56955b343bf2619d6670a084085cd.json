{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) used for smelting operations\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring materials to the furnace\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into a furnace. This will prevent errors related to insufficient items for insertion.\n\n### Errors due to full chests at drop positions\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to ensure continuous operation of mining drills. This will prevent warnings about full chests and halt in resource extraction.\n\n### Warnings for furnaces with no ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients to avoid warnings about missing ingredients. Regularly monitor the supply chain to maintain a steady flow of resources.\n\n### Errors when refueling mining drills\n- Make sure to refuel mining drills with sufficient coal to maintain their operation. Regular checks on fuel levels can prevent unexpected stoppages."}
