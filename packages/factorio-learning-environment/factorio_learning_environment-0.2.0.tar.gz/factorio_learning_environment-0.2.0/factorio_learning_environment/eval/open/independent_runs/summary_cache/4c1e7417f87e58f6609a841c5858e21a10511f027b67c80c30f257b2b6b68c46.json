{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) and (position -15.0, -50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal and actively mining resources.\n  - Warnings indicate that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Stone Furnace** at positions (43.0, -82.0), (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and actively smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -47.5)\n  - Used for storing mined resources and smelted products.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5), (-14.5, -46.5), and (-14.5, -45.5)\n  - Waiting for source items to transfer between entities.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when Extracting from Non-existent or Empty Chests\n- Ensure that the chest contains the required items before attempting to extract. Verify the chest's inventory status to avoid extraction errors.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that the inserters have access to source items. This may involve clearing blockages or ensuring that the source entities are producing items as expected.\n\n#### Warnings about Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full storage."}
