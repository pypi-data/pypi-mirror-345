{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-15.6, 20.4)\nConsists of steam engine (position not specified), boiler (position not specified), and offshore pump (position not specified).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5) and inserter at position that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) that is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of the following entities\n- PipeGroup at position(-4.5, 21.5) with pipes in the group\n- PipeGroup at position(-4.5, 23.5) with pipes in the group\n\n### Electricity group at position(-15.6, 20.4)\nConsists of several small electric poles positioned around (-22.5, 23.5), (-20.5, 23.5), (-21.5, 23.5), (-19.5, 23.5), (-23.5, 24.5), and (-19.5, 25.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables used in your code are defined before they are referenced. For instance, 'Electric' and 'group' were not defined in the current context.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Check that all entities requiring power, such as the lab and assembling machine, are connected to an electricity source."}
