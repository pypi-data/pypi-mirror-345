{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5) connected to a stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with a status of working, producing iron plates.\n- Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storage of iron ore and plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-11.5, -49.5) and (-10.5, -49.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting.\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Supply Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) waiting for items to supply to furnaces.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-10.5, -45.5) and (-11.5, -45.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that upstream supply lines are adequately stocked to prevent inserters from waiting for items. Regularly check and replenish resources in connected chests or supply lines.\n\n### Errors with Full Drop Position Chests\n- Regularly clear chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full inventories. Ensure that there is a system in place to automatically transfer resources from full chests to available storage or processing units.\n\n### Errors with Extraction from Drop Position Chests\n- Ensure that extraction operations are correctly targeted and that there is space available in the inventory to receive extracted items. Verify that extraction commands are executed when the player is within range of the target chest."}
