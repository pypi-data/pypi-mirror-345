{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled by coal, extracting resources and depositing them into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, -58.5) and (5.5, -60.5) for storing extracted resources.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure to regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in resource processing and storage. For example, the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Errors when Storing Iron Plates\n- Avoid placing iron plates into chests that are already full. Chests at positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), and (-8.5, -50.5) are full, which could hinder storage operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - None defined in the current steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore: int` - Represents the quantity of iron ore in the inventory.\n  - `iron_plate: int` - Represents the quantity of iron plates in the inventory.\n  - `coal: int` - Represents the quantity of coal in the inventory.\n  - `wood: int` - Represents the quantity of wood in the inventory.\n  - `iron_gear_wheel: int` - Represents the quantity of iron gear wheels in the inventory."}
