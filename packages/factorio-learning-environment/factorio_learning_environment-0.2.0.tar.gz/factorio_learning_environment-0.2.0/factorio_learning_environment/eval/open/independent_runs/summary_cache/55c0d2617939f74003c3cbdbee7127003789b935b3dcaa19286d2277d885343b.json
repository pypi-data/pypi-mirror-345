{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. Although several recovery updates attempted to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), all placement and crafting attempts failed due to inventory and resource shortages. No connected assemblies (such as production furnaces or labs) were confirmed on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Usage Errors \u2013 When calling get_entities(), avoid unexpected keywords (like \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments. Verify and follow the correct function signature to prevent TypeErrors.\n\u2022 Null Value Handling \u2013 Always check that a query\u2019s return value is not None before iterating over it to avoid \u201cNoneType\u201d errors.\n\u2022 Lab Placement Verification \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab (e.g., at (0.5, 2.5)), confirm that the Lab item exists in inventory; otherwise, placement will fail.\n\u2022 Resource Chain Shortages \u2013 Lab crafting failures arose from missing sub-ingredients (iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, etc.). Ensure that intermediate products (such as iron plates for iron-gear-wheels and copper plates for copper cables) are produced in sufficient quantity before initiating Lab production.\n\u2022 Production Consistency \u2013 Reassess and balance resource inputs (via smelting or other production steps) to maintain a steady supply of required components and avoid repeated crafting deficits."}
