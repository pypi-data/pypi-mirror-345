{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore\n  - (5.5, -60.5)\n  - (6.5, -60.5)\n  - (7.5, -60.5)\n  - (8.5, -60.5)\n  - (9.5, -60.5)\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel and currently working, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel and currently working, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel but not working due to no ingredients to smelt and a full fuel source.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory at Drop Position\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is emptied regularly to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnace\n- Regularly supply the furnace with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production. Check that the input inventory is not empty.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the final inventory state with items like 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n"}
