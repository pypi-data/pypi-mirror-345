Adjust calls to adhere to the proper function signature.\n  - When processing the result of get_entities, ensure that a valid iterable is returned (or default to an empty list) to avoid errors like \"'NoneType' object is not iterable\".\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n  - Attempts to place a Lab at Position(0.5, 2.5) have failed because there was no Lab in inventory. Verify availability before attempting placement.\n  - Lab crafting has repeatedly failed due to missing sub-ingredients (e.g., incomplete chains for iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable). Confirm that all prerequisite resources and their production steps (such as smelting and processing) are complete so that the required components are available before reattempting lab crafting."}
