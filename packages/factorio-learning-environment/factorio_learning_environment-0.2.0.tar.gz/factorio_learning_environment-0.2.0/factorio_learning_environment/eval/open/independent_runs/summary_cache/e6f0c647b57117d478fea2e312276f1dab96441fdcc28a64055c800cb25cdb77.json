{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -79.5) for collecting extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -48.5) for collecting extracted iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace is consistently supplied with iron ore to maintain continuous operation. Frequent checks on the inventory levels of the furnace can prevent downtime.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the Burner Mining Drills to prevent them from becoming non-operational due to lack of fuel. Establishing a routine check and refuel schedule can mitigate this issue.\n\n### Errors Due to Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest, to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drills. This will prevent the drills from being blocked by items on the ground.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int, current inventory count is 18.\n- `iron-ore`: int, current inventory count is 1.\n- `iron-plate`: int, current inventory count is 12."}
