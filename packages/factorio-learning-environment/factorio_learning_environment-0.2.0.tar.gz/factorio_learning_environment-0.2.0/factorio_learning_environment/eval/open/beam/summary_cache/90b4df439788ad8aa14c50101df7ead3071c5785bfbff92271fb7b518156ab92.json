{"content": "The persistent `NameError` indicating that `random` is not defined suggests that there might be an issue with how the environment is handling imports. Here are a few steps and checks to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Import is at the Top**: Make sure the `import random` statement is at the very top of your script, before any other code is executed.\n\n2. **Environment Check**: Verify that the environment you are using supports the Python `random` module. Some restricted environments might not allow certain imports.\n\n3. **Isolated Testing**: Try running a minimal script in the same environment to check if the `random` module can be imported and used independently:\n\n   ```python\n   import random\n\n   # Test random number generation\n   print(random.uniform(-10, 10))\n   ```\n\n4. **Restart the Environment**: Sometimes, restarting the environment or the REPL session can resolve issues with module imports.\n\n5. **Alternative Random Generation**: If the environment has limitations, consider using a different method for generating random numbers, such as a custom function or a predefined list of positions.\n\n6. **Debugging Output**: Add print statements to confirm that the import statement is being executed:\n\n   ```python\n   import random\n   print(\"Random module imported successfully.\")\n   ```\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be necessary to consult the documentation or support resources for the specific environment you are using to understand any limitations or configuration requirements.", "summary_range": "[1-368]"}
