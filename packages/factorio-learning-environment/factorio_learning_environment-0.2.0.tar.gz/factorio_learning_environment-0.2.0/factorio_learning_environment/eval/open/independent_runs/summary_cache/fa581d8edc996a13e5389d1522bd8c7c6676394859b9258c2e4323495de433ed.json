{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that waits for source items\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) that is currently empty\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that is currently empty\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently working with an inventory of iron-ore and iron-plate\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that contains iron-ore\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors due to insufficient fuel**:\n  - Ensure that all burner mining drills and furnaces have enough coal to operate. Regularly check and refill fuel supplies.\n  \n- **Errors when waiting for source items**:\n  - Check the inventory of inserters and ensure they have access to the necessary source items. If they are waiting for source items, verify the source entity's inventory.\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into full output**:\n  - Monitor the output of the stone furnace to ensure it is not full before attempting to insert more items. If it is full, consider moving the output to a storage solution.\n\n- **Errors related to empty inventories**:\n  - Regularly check wooden chests and other storage entities to ensure they are not empty when needed for crafting or fueling.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**:\n  - `insert_into_entity(entity, item)`: Inserts an item into a specified entity. \n    - **Success**: Successfully inserts item if entity has space.\n    - **Failure**: Fails if the entity is full or does not accept the item.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `current_inventory`: dict - Inventory of the agent including wood, coal, iron-ore, iron-plate, and iron-gear-wheel.\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: str - Status of the burner mining drill, indicating if it is working or out of fuel.\n  - `stone_furnace_status`: str - Status of the stone furnace, indicating if it is working or full output."}
