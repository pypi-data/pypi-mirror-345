{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Contains iron ore, currently holding 7 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Refueled with coal and aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Not receiving iron ore, hence not smelting.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Resource Transfer\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer resources from chests to furnaces. Regularly check and adjust inserter setup to maintain efficient resource flow.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining drills and inserters to prevent interruptions in operations. Regularly refuel entities to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors with Resource Overflow\n- Prevent mining drills from stopping by ensuring that the chests at the drop position are not full. Regularly extract resources from chests to free up space.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces are receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inserter setup and resource availability to avoid production halts due to missing ingredients."}
