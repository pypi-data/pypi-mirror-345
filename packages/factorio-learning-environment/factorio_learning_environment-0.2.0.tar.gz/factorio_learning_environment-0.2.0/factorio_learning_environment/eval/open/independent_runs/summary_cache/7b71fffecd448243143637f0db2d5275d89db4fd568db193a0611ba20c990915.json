{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with a result inventory of copper-plate\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with a result inventory of iron-plate\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron-plate\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack, status: NO_POWER\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at various positions (e.g., (-50.5, -122.5), (-45.5, -123.5), (-48.5, -120.5), etc.) with status EMPTY\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions (e.g., (26.5, -38.5), (1.5, -36.5), etc.) with voltage 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check alignment and connectivity to ensure fluid flow.\n\n### Errors in Power Generation\n- Verify that the steam engine is receiving steam from the boiler. Ensure that the boiler is connected to a water source and is operational.\n\n### Errors in Power Network\n- Connect small electric poles to the power network to ensure that entities like inserters and labs receive electricity.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid the NO_INGREDIENTS status.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly inspect connections and statuses of entities to preemptively address warnings such as \"no fluid present in connections\" or \"not connected to power network.\""}
