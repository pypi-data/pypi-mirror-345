{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting these components, with key positions including (-8.5, 23.5) and (-7.5, 24.5)\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at positions such as (-1.5, 26.5), (-0.5, 26.5), and (0.5, 26.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace Setup at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- **Inserter** at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, -61.5)\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (6.5, -59.5)\n- **Small Electric Pole** at positions such as (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5)\n\n### Lab at Position (Not specified)\n- **Lab** with input for automation science pack, currently not in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. For example, make sure to have coal before refueling a boiler or iron ore before inserting into a furnace.\n\n### Errors When Using Inserters\n- Verify that the source and destination entities for inserters are correctly set up and that there are items available to be moved. The inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential setup issue.\n\n### General Inventory Management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the required materials for your tasks. This will help prevent errors related to missing items when interacting with entities."}
