{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) with no fuel, dropping into a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with no fuel, dropping into a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore and copper plate.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items, connected to the mining drill and chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with full fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-17.5, -69.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-16.5, -69.5) waiting for source items, connected to chests.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) with fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests around these positions storing copper ore.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, including a segment from (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and another from (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using pickup_entity function\n- Ensure that the target entity is callable and correctly specified in the function. The error indicates a misuse of the 'Chest' object, which is not callable. Double-check the entity type and method usage.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stalling. The burner mining drill at position (53.0, -83.0) is waiting for space in the destination chest.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. The mining drills at positions (-23.0, -68.0) and (-14.0, -53.0) are out of fuel.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Multiple inserters are waiting for source items, indicating a potential misalignment or lack of input items."}
