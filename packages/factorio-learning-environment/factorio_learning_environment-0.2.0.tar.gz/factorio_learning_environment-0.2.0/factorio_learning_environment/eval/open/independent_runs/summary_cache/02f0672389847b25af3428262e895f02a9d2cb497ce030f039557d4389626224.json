{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal. It extracts iron ore and drops it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) fueled with coal, transferring iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) fueled with coal, waiting to transfer items from the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources in inventory\n- Ensure that you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to refuel or insert items into entities. Regularly check inventory levels to prevent operation interruptions.\n\n### Errors when refueling or inserting items\n- Before attempting to refuel or insert items into an entity, verify that the target entity is accessible and that you have the necessary items in your inventory. This will prevent errors related to unavailable resources.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly monitor the inventory of chests to ensure they do not become full. Empty the chests periodically to maintain continuous operation of connected entities like mining drills and inserters."}
