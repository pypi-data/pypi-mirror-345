{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with copper ore supplied and producing copper plates.\n- Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with copper ore supplied and producing copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest and further distribution.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore between entities.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Code Execution\n- Ensure all required arguments are provided when calling functions. The error in line 13 indicates a missing argument in the function `_modifier()`.\n\n### Inserter Output Blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity available to accept the output from inserters to prevent blockage. The inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) is waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Furnace Without Ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. The furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is not producing due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that source items are available for inserters to function. The inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) is waiting for source items."}
