{"content": "The error indicates that crafting a small electric pole failed because the necessary intermediate resource, wood, is not available. In Factorio, wood is a raw resource that must be gathered from trees. Here's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Gather Wood**: First, ensure you have enough wood in your inventory to craft the small electric pole.\n\n2. **Check for Existing Resources**: If there are trees nearby, gather wood from them. If not, you may need to explore the area to find trees.\n\n3. **Craft the Small Electric Pole**: Once you have gathered enough wood, you can proceed to craft the small electric pole.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your approach:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Resolving power network connectivity for the assembling machine.\")\n\n# Move to the assembling machine's position to address its power issue.\nmove_to(assembling_machine.position)\n\n# Check if wood is available in the inventory.\nplayer_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nwood_count = player_inventory.get(Prototype.Wood, 0)\n\nif wood_count == 0:\n    print(\"Wood is required to craft a small electric pole.
