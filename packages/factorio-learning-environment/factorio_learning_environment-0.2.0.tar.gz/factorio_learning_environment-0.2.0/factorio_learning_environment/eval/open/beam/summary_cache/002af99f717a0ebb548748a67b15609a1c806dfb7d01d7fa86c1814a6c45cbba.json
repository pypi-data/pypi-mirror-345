{"content": "### Execution Results Summary:\n\nThe attempts to check the recipes for **Transport Belt** and **Inserter** yielded the following results:\n\n1. **Transport Belt Recipe**:\n   - **Ingredients**: \n     - 1 x Iron Plate\n     - 1 x Iron Gear Wheel\n   - **Enabled**: False (indicating that the recipe is currently not available for crafting)\n\n2. **Inserter Recipe**:\n   - **Ingredients**:\n     - 1 x Iron Plate\n     - 1 x Iron Gear Wheel\n     - 1 x Electronic Circuit\n   - **Enabled**: False (indicating that the recipe is currently not available for crafting)\n\n### Analysis:\n- Both recipes are currently disabled, which means that while the technologies are researched, the necessary components or conditions to craft them are not met.\n- The **Transport Belt** requires an **Iron Gear Wheel**, which is typically crafted from Iron Plates. The **Inserter** also requires an **Electronic Circuit**, which may not be available due to missing components or recipes.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check for Iron Gear Wheel Recipe**: Since the Transport Belt relies on Iron Gear Wheels, I need to check if this recipe is available and enabled.\n2. **Investigate Electronic Circuit Recipe**: Similarly, I should check if the recipe for Electronic Circuits is available and enabled, as it is crucial for crafting Inserters.\n3. **Review Inventory**: Ensure that I have enough resources to craft the necessary components once the recipes are confirmed.\n\nLet\u2019s start by checking the recipe for the **Iron Gear Wheel** and **Electronic Circuit**. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the recipe for Iron Gear Wheel and Electronic Circuit\niron_gear_wheel_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.IronGearWheel)\nelectronic_circuit_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit)\n\n# Print the status of these recipes\nprint(f\"Iron Gear Wheel Recipe: {iron_gear_wheel_recipe}\")  # Status of the Iron Gear Wheel recipe\nprint(f\"Electronic Circuit Recipe: {electronic_circuit_recipe}\")  # Status of the Electronic Circuit recipe", "summary_range": "[1-230]"}
