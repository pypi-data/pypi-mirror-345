{"content": "The error indicates that there is no power generation setup, such as a steam engine, nearby to provide electricity to the assembling machine. This is why the assembling machine remains in a \"NO_POWER\" state. Let's address this by setting up a basic power generation system.\n\n### Steps to Set Up Power Generation:\n\n1. **Place a Boiler and Steam Engine:**\n   - If you have access to a water source, place a boiler and a steam engine to generate power. Ensure they are connected with pipes and a small electric pole.\n\n2. **Connect the Assembling Machine to Power:**\n   - Use small electric poles to connect the steam engine to the assembling machine.\n\n3. **Ensure Fuel Supply:**\n   - Make sure the boiler has a fuel supply, such as coal, to generate steam.\n\n### Example Code to Set Up Power Generation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Place a boiler near a water source\nwater_position = nearest(Resource.Water)\nboiler_position = Position(water_position.x + 1, water_position.y)\nboiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, boiler_position)\n\n# Step 2: Place a steam engine connected to the boiler\nsteam_engine_position = Position(boiler_position.x + 2, boiler_position.y)\nsteam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, steam_engine_position)\n\n# Step 3: Connect the boiler and steam engine with pipes\nplace_entity(Prototype.Pipe, Position(boiler_position.x + 1, boiler_position.y))\n\n# Step 4: Insert coal into the boiler for fuel\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=10)\n\n# Step 5: Place small electric poles to connect the steam engine to the assembling machine\nconnect_entities(steam_engine_position, pole_position, Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\n\n# Step 6: Verify power connectivity\nprint(\"Power generation setup complete. Verify the assembling machine's power status.\")\n```\n\n### Tips for Successful Power Setup:\n\n- **Water Source:** Ensure the boiler is placed adjacent to a water source for steam generation.\n- **Fuel Supply:** Keep a steady supply of coal or other fuel to the boiler to maintain power generation.\n- **Connection:** Use small electric poles to connect all power-generating entities to the machines that need power.\n- **Proximity:** Ensure all entities are placed close enough to connect with electric poles.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up a basic power generation system and resolve the \"NO_POWER\" issue with the assembling machine.", "summary_range": "[1-140]"}
