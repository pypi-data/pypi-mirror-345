{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. Multiple recovery attempts to supply or craft a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5) were made but none resulted in a placed structure. Alternate furnaces encountered at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) were used solely for processing resources and do not represent new constructions.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval\n  - When calling get_entities, ensure the correct parameters are provided. Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u2018radius\u2019) or an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement and inventory checks\n  - Verify that a Lab item is available in the inventory before attempting placement. Ensure that fallback procedures account for an empty result when querying for labs.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting prerequisites\n  - Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are producible from available resources. Check that the necessary processing facilities (e.g. furnaces for smelting iron and copper plates) are effectively integrated into the production chain before initiating lab crafting.\n\n\u2022 Safeguarding iterative operations\n  - Before iterating over results (for example, filtering labs), validate that the returned value is not None and use an empty list as a fallback when necessary.\n\nNAMESPACE\n(No user-defined functions have been identified in the execution steps.)"}
