{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 80-87)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-18.5, 69.5)\n(Still non-functional with connection issues)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-18.5 y=69.5) - operational but disconnected\n- Boiler (position x=-4.5 y=50.0) - out of fuel and no input liquid\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=50.5) - not connected to power network\n- Pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes (positions: x=-18.5,y=68.5; x=-18.5,y=67.5) - disconnected\n  - Steam pipes (positions: x=0.5,y=47.5) - isolated\n- Power pole networks:\n  - Main grid (positions: x=0.5,y=53.5) - inactive\n  - Isolated pole at x=-50.5 y=18.5\n\n### Stone Mining and Smelting Operation at position (-49.5, 10.5)\n(Unchanged from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5 y=10.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0 y=11.0)\n- Input inserter (position x=-47.5 y=10.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-44.5 y=11.5)\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=12.5)\n\n### Mining Operation at position (-52.5, 16.5)\n(Now operational but isolated)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-52.5 y=16.5) - receiving stone but no power\n- Stone furnace (position x=-50.0 y=16.0) - working with coal (18 remaining)\n- Power pole (position x=-50.5 y=18.5) - still isolated\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid Connection Failures (critical)\n- Repeated pipe connection failures (steps 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85)\n  - Offshore pump to boiler connection failing\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Verify clear path between connection points\n    2. Check entity orientations match\n    3. Implement step-by-step connection validation\n\n### Placement Distance Issues (new)\n- Multiple placement distance errors (steps 82, 87)\n  - Attempting to place pipes too far from player\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Move player character to target area before building\n    2. Implement distance checks before placement\n\n### Collision Detection (ongoing)\n- Placement collision errors (steps 83, 84, 85)\n  - Existing entities blocking placement\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Scan target area before placement\n    2. Implement automatic obstacle clearing\n    3. Use underground pipes for crowded areas\n\n### Power System Validation (ongoing)\n- Multiple verification failures\n  - Boiler fuel status not checked\n  - Steam engine connection not verified\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement pre-operation checks for:\n       - Fuel levels\n       - Fluid connections\n       - Power network status\n\n### System Verification (ongoing)\n- Operational issues persisting:\n  - No production verification\n  - Missing status checks\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement post-build verification\n    2. Add production testing\n    3. Create diagnostic checks\n\n### Resource Management (ongoing)\n- Coal depletion risk\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement fuel monitoring\n    2. Add low-fuel alerts\n    3. Create refueling system\n\n### Entity Management (ongoing)\n- Missing entity references\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Maintain entity tracking\n    2. Implement existence checks\n    3. Handle replacement cases\n\n### Build Process Improvements (ongoing)\n- Multiple build failures:\n  - Need for position adjustments\n  - Solutions:\n    1.
