{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. The logs indicate multiple attempts to place entities such as Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts, but all attempts have failed due to various errors. Therefore, there are no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable positions\n- Ensure that the position where you intend to place an entity is buildable. Check the terrain and any existing restrictions before attempting to place entities like Stone Furnaces and Wooden Chests.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you wish to place. This includes checking for any other entities or obstacles that might prevent placement.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources available to supply to entities like Stone Furnaces. If an entity requires a resource to function, make sure it is adequately supplied.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without checking global build restrictions\n- Before placing entities, check for any global build restrictions that might prevent placement, such as environmental settings or game rules that restrict building in certain areas.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without checking initial conditions\n- Confirm that the environment is initialized correctly and that all necessary preconditions for placing entities are met. This includes ensuring that the inventory is correctly set up and that the initial position is suitable for building.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in establishing structures and avoid common pitfalls in entity placement."}
