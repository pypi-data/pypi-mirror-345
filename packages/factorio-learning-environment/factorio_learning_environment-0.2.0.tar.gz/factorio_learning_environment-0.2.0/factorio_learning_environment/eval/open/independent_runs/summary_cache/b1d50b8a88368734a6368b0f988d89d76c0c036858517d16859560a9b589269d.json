{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with a full output warning, currently holding 28 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) currently holding 6 iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) holding 80 iron ore and 1266 iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) facing DOWN, waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) facing DOWN, working.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) facing UP, waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -45.5) facing DOWN, working.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -43.5) facing DOWN, waiting for source items.\n- BeltGroup with 5 belts, working, transporting iron plates.\n- BeltGroup with 2 belts, empty.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belts connecting various positions to facilitate movement of items between furnaces, inserters, and chests.\n- Belt at position (-16.5, -48.5) to (-16.5, -46.5) directing DOWN.\n- Belt at position (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -47.5) directing UP.\n- Belt at position (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -43.5) directing DOWN.\n\n### Iron Ore Supply System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) currently empty.\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) currently empty.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -45.5) facing UP, waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -44.5) facing RIGHT, waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and facing the right direction to pick up source items. Adjust the direction as necessary to ensure proper operation.\n\n### Errors with Source Items\n- Verify that source items are available for inserters to pick up. If an inserter is waiting for source items, check the supply chain and ensure that items are being delivered to the source location.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is not occupied by another entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or choosing a different reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Extraction\n- Ensure that the entity from which you are trying to extract items exists and contains the desired items. Double-check the entity's position and inventory before attempting extraction."}
