{"content": "The extraction of stone from the active furnace has been completed successfully, and the following observations can be made:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now contains **18 Iron Plates** and no remaining stone, confirming that the extraction was successful.\n- The furnace is still in a **\"WORKING\"** state but is not processing any materials, as it shows no ingredients available.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **1 piece of stone** remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore available**.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates available**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has been reset and is now empty of stone, but it still holds **18 Iron Plates**.\n- The Copper Ore remains unprocessed, and the furnace's status indicates it is not actively smelting anything.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Iron Plates**: To fully reset the furnace and allow it to accept new inputs, I will extract the **18 Iron Plates** currently in the furnace.\n2. **Load Stone and Copper Ore**: Once the furnace is cleared, I will load the required **5 pieces of stone** and **1 piece of Copper Ore** to initiate the smelting process.\n3. **Monitor Smelting Operation**: After loading the materials, I will check to ensure the furnace begins processing the Copper Ore into Copper Plates.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the Iron Plates from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the Iron Plates from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, active_furnace, quantity=18)  # Extract all 18 pieces of Iron Plates currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting Iron Plates: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting Iron Plates: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-338]"}
