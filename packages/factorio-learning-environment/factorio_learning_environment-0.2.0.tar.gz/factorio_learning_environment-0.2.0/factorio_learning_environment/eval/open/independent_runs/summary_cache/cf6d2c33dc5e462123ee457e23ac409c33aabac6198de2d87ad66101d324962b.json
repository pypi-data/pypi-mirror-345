{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Station at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Station at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-13.5, -49.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), (-8.5, -49.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that the upstream supply of items is consistent and sufficient to prevent inserters from waiting for items. Check the supply chain leading to inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5).\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly clear out full chests to prevent mining drills from stopping. This applies to chests at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### Furnace Output Blockage\n- Ensure that the output of furnaces is not blocked by full inventories. Regularly clear the furnace output to maintain production efficiency. This applies to furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0).\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the destination for inserters to drop items. This applies to inserters at positions (-10.5, -49.5) and (-11.5, -49.5)."}
