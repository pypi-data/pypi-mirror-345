{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5) and a wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that is currently full.\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when using the Burner Mining Drill with a full chest**  \n  Ensure to empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) before continuing to mine, as the drill cannot drop off resources when the chest is full.\n\n- **Errors when feeding the Stone Furnace with no ingredients**  \n  Make sure to have the necessary ingredients available to feed into the Stone Furnace. Currently, it has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n- **Repeated actions without change**  \n  Avoid repeatedly refueling or feeding the same entities without checking their status. This can lead to unnecessary actions and wasted resources.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined yet.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Entity of type `BurnerMiningDrill` at position (-15.0, -50.0).\n  - `stone_furnace`: Entity of type `Furnace` at position (0.0, 0.0).\n  - `wooden_chest`: Entity of type `Chest` at position (-14.5, -48.5) and (2.5, 0.5).\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary containing items with their counts."}
