{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and producing iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and producing iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and producing iron plates.\n- **Storage**:\n  - Iron chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron plates.\n  - Multiple wooden chests at various positions for additional storage, some of which are full.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Burner mining drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) fueled by coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Storage**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" suggests that the agent attempted to insert coal without having it available.\n\n### Warnings about full storage\n- Regularly check and manage storage capacities to prevent chests from becoming full. The warning \"chest at drop position is full\" indicates that the mining operation is halted due to full storage, requiring manual intervention to clear space.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `insert_item`: Function to insert items into a specified entity. Failure mode observed when attempting to insert items not present in the inventory.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `drill`: Represents the burner mining drill entity.\n  - `coal_to_insert`: Quantity of coal intended for insertion into the drill.\n  - Inventory variables such as `iron-ore`, `iron-plate`, and `iron-gear-wheel` track quantities of these items in the agent's possession."}
