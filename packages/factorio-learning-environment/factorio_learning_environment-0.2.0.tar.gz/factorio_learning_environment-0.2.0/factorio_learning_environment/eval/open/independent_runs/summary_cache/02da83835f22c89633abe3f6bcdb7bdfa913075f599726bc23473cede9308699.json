{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Line (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt system:\n  - Input belt at (41.5, -80.5) facing right\n  - Output belt at (42.5, -80.5) facing right\n- Burner inserter at (43.5, -80.5) picking up from (42.5, -80.5) and dropping at (44.5, -80.5)\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n\nCurrent status: The system is partially blocked - mining drill cannot output due to blocked belt, inserter waiting for space at drop position, and furnace has no ingredients but full fuel.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location and surrounding area is clear of other entities\n- When rebuilding structures, remove conflicting entities first before placing new ones\n- Pay attention to entity sizes - furnaces are 2x2 while inserters are 1x1\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to add more items\n- Ensure proper spacing between belts and connected entities\n- Verify belt directions align with intended material flow\n\n### Structure Alignment\n- When building processing lines, ensure proper Y-axis alignment between belts, inserters and furnaces\n- Consider the pickup and drop positions of inserters when placing connected entities\n- Leave adequate spacing between large entities (like furnaces) to prevent overlap\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places specified entity at target location\n  Success: When target location is clear and valid\n  Failure: When location is blocked or invalid\n\nVariables:\n- furnace: Entity (stone-furnace)\n- inserter: Entity (burner-inserter)\n- belt_group: BeltGroup containing transport belts\n- mining_drill: Entity (burner-mining-drill)"}
