# ImageInsight

A Python pipeline for extracting visual activations from images, processing them, and generating semantic descriptions using a neural network model. The pipeline utilizes PyTorch, a pre-trained AlexNet model, and a customa recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder comprised of  bidirectional GRU's (Gated Recurrent Unit). The RNN takes the activations from the penultimate layer of Alexnet which is passesed through fully connected layers (FC layers) and then is decoded into semnatic descriptors of the image (e.g., is red, is green, is round etc). Lastly the penultimate layer from the RNN can be extracted for further evaluation.

For more information, please refer to --> (link to paper)

## Features

- **Activation Extraction**: Extract visual activations from images using a pre-trained AlexNet model.
- **Semantic Descriptions**: Generate descriptions from the extracted activations using a RNN.
- **Device Support**: Optionally run on GPU or CPU.
- **Configurable Model**: Easily switch between different model layers for activation extraction from Alexnet.

## Usage

After installing the required dependencies, you can run the pipeline using your own set of images and a pre-trained model. Here's an example of how to use the pipeline:

```python
   from ImageInsight import ImageInsight  # Correct import of the ImageInsight class

   # Define paths and settings for running the pipeline
   image_folder = "path/to/your/images"  # Folder containing the input images
   model_name = "alexnet"  # Name of the pre-trained model to use
   layer_index = 4  # The index of the layer from which activations will be extracted
   use_gpu = False  # Set to True if a GPU is available for faster processing
   csv_output_path = "path/to/output/folder"  # Path to the folder where the CSV output will be saved
   csv_file_name = "visual_activations_output.csv"  # Name of the CSV file for the visual activations
   model_path = "path/to/your/model.pt"  # Path to the pre-trained model

   # Initialize the ImageInsight model with the path to the pre-trained model and GPU usage option
   #or use the semantic model which we provide on our github page
   insight = ImageInsight(model_path=model_path, use_gpu=True)

   # Run the pipeline
   semantic_activations = insight.run_pipeline(
      image_folder=image_folder,
      model_name=model_name,
      layer_index=layer_index,
      csv_output_path=csv_image_output_path,
      csv_file_name=csv_file_name
   )

   # Print the generated semantic activations and descriptions
   print(semantic_activations)
```
