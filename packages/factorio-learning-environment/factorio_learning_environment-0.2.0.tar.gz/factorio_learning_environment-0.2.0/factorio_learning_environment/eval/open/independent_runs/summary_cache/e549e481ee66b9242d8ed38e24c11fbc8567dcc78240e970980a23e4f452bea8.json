{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Basic Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (1.5, 0.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (3.0, 1.0) fueled with coal, currently having a warning for \"no ingredients to smelt\" and containing 5 iron plates in the result inventory.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 3.5), fueled with coal, waiting for source items, with pickup position at (3.5, 4.5) and drop position at (3.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new one. For example, attempts to place a burner-inserter next to x=1.5 y=0.5 failed due to collision with existing entities like a stone furnace at (3, 1).\n\n### Errors when connecting belts\n- Belts cannot be connected directly from a stone furnace or wooden chest. Use an inserter to transfer items from these entities to the belts.\n\n### Errors when defining variables\n- Ensure all variables are correctly defined before use. Errors such as \"name 'new_chest' is not defined\" indicate that a variable was referenced before being assigned.\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Verify that the placement position for wooden chests is valid and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features. Multiple attempts to place wooden chests at various positions failed due to invalid placement conditions.\n\n### Errors when powering inserters\n- Ensure that all inserters are correctly defined and powered. Errors like \"name 'ore_inserter' is not defined\" suggest that the inserter was not properly initialized or referenced."}
