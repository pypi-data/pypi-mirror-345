All reattempts (using L-shaped, extended, revised, and manual linear routes) have failed due to connection misalignments and buildability issues.\n\n### Pipe Production Facility at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Assembling Machine (position: 3.5, 0.5) \u2013 Configured for pipe crafting.\n\u2022 Iron Chest (position: 1.5, 0.5) \u2013 Stores crafted pipes.\n\u2022 Electricity Network \u2013 Comprised of small electric poles linking production components.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Pipeline Connection Errors\n\u2003- Verify that both source and target connection points for multi-segment pipelines are unobstructed, correctly aligned, and within the required range.\n\u2003- Ensure that the fluid output from the source exactly matches the input expected by the target to avoid mismatches (e.g. errors indicating \u201cfluids currently at source \u2026 not needed\u201d).\n\u2003- When using intermediate nodes, double-check node placements to confirm all segments meet at buildable tiles.\n\n\u2022 Pipeline Placement Errors\n\u2003- Manual placement failures citing \u201cposition not buildable\u201d indicate that the target coordinates are unsuitable. Confirm tile buildability prior to attempting pipe placement along a calculated linear path.\n\n\u2022 Offshore Pump Repositioning and API Usage\n\u2003- Undefined function errors (e.g. \u201cshift_entity is not defined\u201d) reveal use of non-existent API functions. Use only functions that are properly defined (such as get_entity or rotate_entity) to adjust entity positions.\n\u2003- Validate entity retrieval before and after repositioning; errors from get_entity indicate that the expected entity is not present at the target coordinates.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and Resource Dependency Issues\n\u2003- Crafting failures for additional pipes due to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-plate) suggest that the smelting and crafting chain is not adequately supplying required materials. Ensure that production of essential items is in place before initiating dependent craft actions.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 get_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any  \n\u2003Retrieves an entity of the specified type at the given position.
