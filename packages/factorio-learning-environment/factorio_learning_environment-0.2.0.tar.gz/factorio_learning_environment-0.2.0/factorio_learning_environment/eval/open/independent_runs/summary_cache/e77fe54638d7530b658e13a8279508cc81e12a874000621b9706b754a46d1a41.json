{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis facility is responsible for extracting iron ore, storing it in a chest, and then smelting it into iron plates using a stone furnace. The burner inserter is used to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis facility extracts coal, stores it in a chest, and uses it as fuel for the stone furnace. The burner inserter transfers coal from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to missing items during insertion operations.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly check and empty chests to ensure they are not full. This will prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests at their drop positions.\n\n### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and maintain the supply chain to avoid interruptions in production."}
