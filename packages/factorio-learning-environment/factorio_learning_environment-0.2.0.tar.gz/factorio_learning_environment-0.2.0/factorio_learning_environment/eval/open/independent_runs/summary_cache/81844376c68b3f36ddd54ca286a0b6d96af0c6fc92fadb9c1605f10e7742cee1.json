{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All placement attempts have failed, resulting in no entities being placed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. Check for any hidden constraints or map settings that might prevent placement.\n- Confirm that you are within a buildable area before attempting to place any entity. Verify the boundaries of buildable areas and ensure that the position is valid.\n- Consider potential global constraints or map-wide restrictions that might be affecting placement. Re-evaluate these constraints and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n- When placing entities like chests or transport belts, ensure there are no cross-type issues or mismatches with the intended placement area.\n\n### Errors related to global constraints\n- Regularly check for any global map restrictions or settings that might impact entity placement. Adjust your approach if such constraints are identified.\n- Re-evaluate potential global constraints affecting placement, especially when encountering repeated placement failures in different locations.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect data handling\n- Address data handling issues such as \"string indices must be integers\" by ensuring correct data types and structures are used in your code."}
