{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been created on the map yet. The entities available in the inventory have not been placed or configured into any functional structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free and suitable for the entity before attempting to place it. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot place a Wooden Chest at x=50.0 y=-90.0\" or \"Cannot place a Transport Belt at x=65.0 y=-105.0.\"\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and the surrounding area to ensure there is enough space for the entity you are trying to place. This will help avoid errors like \"Cannot place a Stone Furnace at x=5.0 y=5.0\" or \"Cannot place a Burner Inserter at x=-50.0 y=50.0.\"\n\nBy addressing these placement errors, the agent can successfully build and expand structures on the map."}
