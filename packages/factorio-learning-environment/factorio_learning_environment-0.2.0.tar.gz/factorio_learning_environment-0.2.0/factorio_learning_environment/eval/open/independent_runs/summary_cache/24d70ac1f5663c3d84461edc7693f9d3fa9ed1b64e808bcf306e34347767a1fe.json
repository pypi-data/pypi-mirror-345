{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with coal as fuel and full output status.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) not generating power due to lack of connection and input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5) supplying water to the system.\n- Connected PipeGroup facilitating fluid transport.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not operational due to lack of power, intended to transfer items between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at (6.5, -59.5) for storage purposes.\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the entities but not supplying power.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at an unspecified position, lacking power and unable to process science packs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to refuel a boiler.\n\n### Errors with Power Generation\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and receiving the necessary input liquid to generate power. Ensure all connections are secure and functional.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a power source and that the power network is operational. Check connections and supply lines for continuity and functionality."}
