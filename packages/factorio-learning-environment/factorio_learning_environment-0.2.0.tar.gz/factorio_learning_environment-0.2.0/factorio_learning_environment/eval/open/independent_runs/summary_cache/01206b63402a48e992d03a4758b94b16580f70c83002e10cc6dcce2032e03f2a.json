{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n### Coal Refueling Setup\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5): Transfers coal to the stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) but is currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with both their pickup and drop positions. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of resources, as seen with the inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) which was frequently repositioned.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Regularly check the setup of inserters and ensure that the furnace is correctly aligned to receive resources from inserters. The furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or incorrect inserter setup.\n\n### Errors When Using Inventory Items\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. An error occurred when trying to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Refueling and Resource Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in all burner entities to ensure continuous operation. Regularly refuel mining drills and inserters to prevent interruptions in resource processing."}
