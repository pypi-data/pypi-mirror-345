{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) which extracts coal. It is currently out of fuel.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) which is waiting for source items. It transfers coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) which stores coal extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) which stores coal transferred by the burner inserter.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) which is waiting for source items. It transfers coal from the mining drill to another wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) which stores coal transferred by the burner inserter.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting positions (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5) which transports coal along the belt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) which smelts iron ore into iron plates. It currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Furnace** at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) which smelts iron ore into iron plates. It currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to entities running out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like burner mining drills and burner inserters to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check the inventory of source entities."}
