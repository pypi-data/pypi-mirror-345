{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production structure at position around (16, 71) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving ore from mining drill to furnace\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (14.5, 73.5) extracting iron plates from furnace onto transport belts\n- Transport belts connecting furnace output inserter at (13.5, 73.5) to assembling machine input inserter at (24.5, 73.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates\n- Burner inserters at (19.5, 73.5) and (23.5, 73.5) respectively taking iron gear wheels from assembler and feeding iron plates into assembler\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels from output inserter\n- Small electric poles at (21.5, 75.5) and (14.5, 71.5) intended to power the assembling machine and inserters, connected in an electricity group\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to placing entities where inventory lacks the item\n- Ensure the required item is present in inventory before attempting to place it (e.g., assembling-machine-1 was not in inventory when placement was attempted).\n- Double-check inventory contents before placement commands.\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts directly from furnaces\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from furnace entities.\n- Always use an inserter to extract items from furnaces and use the inserter as the source entity for belt connections.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Placement failed when trying to place burner inserters or electric poles on tiles already occupied by other entities (wooden chest, burner inserter, or other objects).\n- Use increased spacing, change direction, or adjust reference position to find free tiles for placement.\n- Implement checks to confirm tile availability before placing entities.\n\n### Errors related to power supply and electricity connections\n- Assembling machine reported no power despite electric poles placed nearby.\n- Ensure electric poles are correctly connected and cover all powered entities.\n- Verify that the electricity network is continuous and that poles are placed on valid positions without obstruction.\n- Check that power poles are properly connected to each other to form a valid electricity group.\n\n### Errors in code logic and type usage\n- TypeError due to treating a boolean as iterable when checking assembler power status.\n- Validate variable types before iteration; ensure that functions expecting iterables receive correct data types.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been reported in the logs so far."}
