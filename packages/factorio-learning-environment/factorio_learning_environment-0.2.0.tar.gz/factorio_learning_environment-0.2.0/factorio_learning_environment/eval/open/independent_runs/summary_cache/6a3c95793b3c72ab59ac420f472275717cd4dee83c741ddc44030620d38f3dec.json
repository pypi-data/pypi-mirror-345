{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (52.0, -79.0) (no ingredients to smelt)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (53.5, -79.5) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (54.5, -79.5) (contains 336 iron plates)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) (empty)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) (out of fuel)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -48.5) (out of fuel)\n\n#### Storage Area at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (0.5, 0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (1.5, 0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (3.5, 0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, 0.5) (contains coal and iron ore)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (5.5, 0.5) (contains iron ore, plates, and gear wheels)\n\n#### Coal Transfer Setup at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) (empty)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (43.5, -80.5) (contains 39 coal)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining Drill Not Working\n- **Error**: The mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) is not working due to lack of fuel.\n- **Tip**: Ensure the mining drill is fueled with coal or another suitable fuel source. Check the fuel inventory of the drill and refill it if necessary.\n\n#### Burner Inserters Out of Fuel\n- **Error**: Multiple burner inserters are out of fuel, causing them to stop functioning.\n- **Tip**: Regularly check the fuel levels of burner inserters and refill them with coal or another fuel source to maintain operation.\n\n#### Furnace Has No Ingredients\n- **Error**: The stone furnace at position (52.0, -79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Tip**: Ensure that the furnace is supplied with iron ore and fuel. Check the inserter responsible for feeding the furnace and ensure it is functioning correctly.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- **Error**: The burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) is waiting for source items.\n- **Tip**: Verify that the source chest (wooden chest at position 41.5, -80.5) contains items to be transferred. If empty, ensure the upstream production chain is functioning correctly.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **None defined yet**\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **None assigned yet**"}
