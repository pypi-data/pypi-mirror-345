{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer Station at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at Position (53.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at Position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal, with 792 units of coal currently in inventory.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items, connected to the chest at (52.5, -77.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Station at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, -49.5) storing extracted iron ore, with 99 units of iron ore currently in inventory.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items, connected to the chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, connected to the chest at (-13.5, -45.5).\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -45.5) currently empty.\n\n### Storage Facility at Position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (0.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Manual Extraction Errors\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity from which you want to extract items to avoid manual extraction failures.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check for blockages or ensure that the source entities have items available for the inserters to pick up. This will prevent inserters from waiting indefinitely for source items.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and inserters.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked by the agent in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Current inventory includes 'wooden-chest': 2, 'wood': 10, 'coal': 1080, 'iron-ore': 2050, 'iron-plate': 1433."}
