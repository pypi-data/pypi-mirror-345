{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, here is the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (-82.0, 41.0)\n- Burner mining drill positioned at x=41.0, y=-82.0 mining coal\n- Two iron chests at x=41.5, y=-84.5 and x=41.5, y=-83.5 storing coal\n- Current status: Mining drill needs fuel\n\n### Iron Smelting System at (-81.0, 46.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at x=45.0, y=-81.0 and x=47.0, y=-81.0\n- Input wooden chest at x=46.5, y=-77.5\n- Two burner inserters at x=46.5, y=-78.5 and x=47.5, y=-78.5 facing UP\n- Belt system:\n  - Left belt path: x=46.5, y=-79.5 to x=45.5, y=-79.5\n  - Right belt start at x=47.5, y=-79.5\n- Output handling:\n  - Two burner inserters at x=45.5, y=-82.5 and x=47.5, y=-82.5\n  - Output wooden chests at x=45.5, y=-84.5 and x=46.5, y=-83.5\n- Storage chests:\n  - Wooden chest at x=49.5, y=-80.5 (full with coal)\n  - Wooden chest at x=49.5, y=-79.5 (contains coal and iron plates)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing belts\n- Check for existing entities that might block belt placement\n- Verify belt connections align properly with furnace inputs\n\n### Entity Alignment Issues\n- Pay attention to exact positioning when creating connected systems\n- Ensure inserters and belts are properly aligned with input/output positions\n- Double check entity rotation directions match the intended flow\n\n### Resource Management\n- Verify fuel availability for burner entities\n- Ensure input materials are available before testing systems\n- Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `left_end`, `right_end`: Belt (Used for belt endpoint placement)\n- `left_start`, `right_start`: Belt (Used for belt start point placement)\n\n### Functions\nNo explicit function definitions found in the provided logs.\n\nThe system appears to be a work in progress with ongoing corrections to the belt system and entity alignments. Several attempts were made to establish proper belt connections between the input inserters and furnaces."}
