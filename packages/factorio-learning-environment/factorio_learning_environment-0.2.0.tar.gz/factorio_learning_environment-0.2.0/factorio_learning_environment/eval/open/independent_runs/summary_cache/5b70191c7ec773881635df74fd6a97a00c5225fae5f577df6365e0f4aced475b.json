{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5) for transferring items into the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-7.5, -49.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-5.5, -49.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storing items.\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace to other entities, facilitating the movement of materials.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- BeltGroup starting at position (-15.5, -54.5) and moving right to position (-13.5, -54.5) for transporting iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Furnaces or Chests\n- Ensure you use an inserter to connect belts to a Prototype.StoneFurnace or Prototype.WoodenChest. Belts cannot be connected directly to these entities.\n\n### NameError: Undefined Variable\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. For example, the variable `drill_to_belt_inserter` must be defined before accessing its properties.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, make sure you have coal available before trying to insert it into an inserter."}
