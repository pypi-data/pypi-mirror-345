{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal, extracting iron ore and depositing it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Operations\n- Ensure adequate coal supply in inventory to refuel mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly check and replenish coal to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Not Producing Iron Plates\n- Verify that the furnace has both coal and iron ore. Ensure that the inserter is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Chest Overcapacity Warning\n- Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Consider expanding storage capacity or increasing item processing speed.\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Double-check inserter alignment to ensure it is correctly positioned to transfer materials between entities. Adjust positions as necessary to maintain efficient workflow."}
