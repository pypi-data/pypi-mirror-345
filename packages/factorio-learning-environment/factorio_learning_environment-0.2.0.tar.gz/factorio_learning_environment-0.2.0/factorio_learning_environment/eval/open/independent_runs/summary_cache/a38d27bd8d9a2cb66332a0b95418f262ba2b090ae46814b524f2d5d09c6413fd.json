{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Boiler** at (x=-5.0, y=2.5)  \n- **Steam engine** at (x=0.5, y=6.5)  \n- **Small electric pole** at (x=3.5, y=6.5)  \n- Connected via pipes and power poles to form a functional electricity generation system.\n\n#### Oil Extraction and Processing Facility at position (x=17.5, y=40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (x=17.5, y=40.5)  \n- **Storage tank** at (x=22.5, y=44.5) for crude oil  \n- **Oil refinery** at (x=29.5, y=48.5) (set to basic oil processing)  \n- **Petroleum gas storage tank** at (x=35.5, y=49.5)  \n- **Chemical plant** at (x=41.5, y=52.5) (set to plastic production)  \n- Connected via pipes and power poles to form an oil extraction and processing chain.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Incorrect Prototype Names\n- Use `Prototype.PumpJack` instead of `Prototype.Pumpjack`.  \n- Ensure correct spelling and capitalization when referencing prototypes.\n\n#### Missing Recipe Before Connection\n- Set a recipe on `OilRefinery` and `ChemicalPlant` before attempting to connect pipes.  \n- Example: `set_recipe(oil_refinery, \"basic-oil-processing\")` before connecting inputs/outputs.\n\n#### Empty Fluid Source Connections\n- Ensure the source entity (e.g., storage tank) has fluid before connecting to a `ChemicalPlant` or `OilRefinery`.  \n- Verify fluid presence with `storage_tank.fluid_amount > 0`.\n\n#### Assertion Errors in Entity Connections\n- When using `connect_entities`, ensure there are valid waypoints (e.g., multiple entities or positions).  \n- Example: Provide intermediate positions for long-distance pipe/power connections.\n\n#### Missing Ingredients in Production\n- Check recipe requirements before starting production (e.g., plastic production needs coal and petroleum gas).  \n- Ensure all required items/fluids are available in the input inventory or connected systems.\n\n#### Incorrect Attribute Checks\n- Use `fluid_amount` instead of `contents` to check fluid levels in storage tanks.  \n- Example: `assert storage_tank.fluid_amount > 0, \"No oil being produced\"`."}
