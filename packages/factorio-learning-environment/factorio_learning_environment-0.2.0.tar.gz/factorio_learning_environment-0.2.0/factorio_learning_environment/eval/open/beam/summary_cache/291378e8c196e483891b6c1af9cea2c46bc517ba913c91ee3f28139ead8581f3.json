{"content": "I see the pattern of errors now. Let's analyze the key issues:\n\n1. Position Issues:\n- We're trying to place entities at (0,0) by default\n- We need to specify exact positions relative to where we are\n- Maximum placement distance is 10 units\n\n2. Movement Issues:\n- We successfully move to the iron ore patch\n- But then try to place entities at default (0,0) position\n- Need to place entities relative to our current position\n\nLet's try a corrected approach:\n\n```python\n# First move to iron ore\ncurrent_pos = move_to(nearest(Resource.IronOre))\nprint(f\"Moved to position: {current_pos}\")\n\n# Calculate new positions relative to where we are\nfurnace_pos = Position(\n    x=current_pos.x + 2,  # 2 units to the right of current position\n    y=current_pos.y       # same y coordinate\n)\n\n# Place furnace at calculated position\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=furnace_pos\n)\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Place mining drill relative to our position\ndrill_pos = Position(\n    x=current_pos.x,      # current x coordinate\n    y=current_pos.y       # current y coordinate\n)\n\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=drill_pos\n)\nprint(f\"Placed drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Check inventory status\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nKey Learnings:\n1. Always specify exact positions for entity placement\n2. Use relative positioning from current location\n3. Stay within 10-unit placement radius\n4. Check inventory before attempting placement\n5. Use Position objects for precise placement\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this corrected approach?", "summary_range": "[1-2602]"}
