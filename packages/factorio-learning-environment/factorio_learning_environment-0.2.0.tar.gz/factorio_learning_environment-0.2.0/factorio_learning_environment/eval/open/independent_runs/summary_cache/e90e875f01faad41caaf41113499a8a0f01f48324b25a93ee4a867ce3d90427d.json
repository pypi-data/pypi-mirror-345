{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=25.5), (x=-7.5, y=24.5)]\n- PipeGroup connecting Boiler to Steam Engine with pipes at positions [(x=-5.5, y=23.5), (x=-4.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=23.5), ..., (x=-2.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5)]\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) connected to power network, aligned to take items from Stone Furnace\n\n### Inserter and Power Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) connected to a power network\n- Small Electric Pole network connecting the Inserters and Steam Engine\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities Without Required Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. This includes pipes for fluid connections and small electric poles for electrical connections.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Check your inventory for required materials before attempting to craft items. Plan resource gathering to ensure you have enough materials for crafting essential items like Small Electric Poles.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like Boilers. Regularly check your inventory levels and gather resources as needed.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that all inserters are connected to a power source and that the power network is operational. Regularly check the status of inserters to ensure they are powered and functioning correctly.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the correct pipe connections are made between entities. Check that the pipe network is complete and properly connected from the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and from the Boiler to the Steam Engine.\n\n### Errors when Using Undefined Variables\n- Make sure all variables are defined before use. Double-check variable names and their definitions to avoid NameErrors.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts Incorrectly\n- When connecting belts, ensure that the correct entities are used. Use inserters to take items from Stone Furnaces instead of attempting direct belt connections.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing a new entity. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid overlap with existing entities."}
