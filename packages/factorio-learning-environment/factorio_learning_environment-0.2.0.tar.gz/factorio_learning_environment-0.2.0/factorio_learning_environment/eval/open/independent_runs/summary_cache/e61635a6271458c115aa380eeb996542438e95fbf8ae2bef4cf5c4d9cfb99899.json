{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) that transfers iron ore from the chest to:\n    - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring items from the chest to another:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) to:\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) awaiting source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- **Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination**: Ensure that the destination chest or entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred. Regularly monitor and clear out destination inventories to prevent bottlenecks.\n  \n### Errors with Inserter Source Items\n- **Inserter Waiting for Source Items**: Ensure that the source chest or entity has sufficient items for the inserter to transfer. Regularly supply source inventories to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Output Blockage\n- **Furnace Result is Full**: Regularly transfer items from the furnace output to prevent production halts due to full output inventories. Consider using additional storage chests or faster inserters to manage high production rates."}
