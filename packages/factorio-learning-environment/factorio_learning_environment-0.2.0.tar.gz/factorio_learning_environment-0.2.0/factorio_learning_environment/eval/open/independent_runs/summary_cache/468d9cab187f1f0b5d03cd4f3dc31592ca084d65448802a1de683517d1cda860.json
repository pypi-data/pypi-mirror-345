{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is connected to the boiler via pipes, which transport steam generated from the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n  \n### Copper plate factory at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) that is currently not conducting any research.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) which is currently not able to create automation-science-pack due to missing resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities you are trying to connect are valid and that there are no obstacles in between. Double-check the coordinates of the boiler and offshore pump to ensure they are correctly positioned for connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors related to missing resources\n- When attempting to create items in the assembling machine, ensure that all required resources are available in the inventory to avoid item ingredient shortages."}
