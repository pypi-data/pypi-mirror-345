The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources\n- Gather the necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is required to craft a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft an item without unlocking the technology\n- Research the required technology before attempting to craft items that depend on it, such as steel-processing for crafting steel chests.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the target entity has the capacity to accept items before inserting them. For instance, check the inventory of the furnace before inserting iron ore or coal."}
