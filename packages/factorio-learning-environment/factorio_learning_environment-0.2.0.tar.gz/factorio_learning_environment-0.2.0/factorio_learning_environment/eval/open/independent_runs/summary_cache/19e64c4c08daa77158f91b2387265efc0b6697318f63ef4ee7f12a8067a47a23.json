For instance, using place_entity_next_to with zero spacing can conflict with existing entities (such as a burner inserter already occupying a position).\n  - Confirm that the intended drop positions are free and suitable for direct placement; if a designated drop tile is unbuildable, reassess the candidate offsets.\n\n\u2022 Output Inserter and Sink Clearing Issues\n  - Sink chest placements must clear the output inserter\u2019s WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS status. Persisting status indicates misalignment or an obstruction; consider repositioning the sink chest to match the inserter\u2019s drop exactly.\n  \n\u2022 API Usage and Parameter Validation\n  - When invoking functions like pickup_entity, ensure that if the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument is passed as None to prevent ValueErrors.\n\n\u2022 Alignment and Rotation\n  - Rotate burner inserters so their pickup and drop positions precisely align with the mining drill output and the corresponding sink chest. Misalignment (as seen with the initial drop set at (-14.5, -50.5)) leads to blocked outputs.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Chest Fullness Management\n  - Monitor sink chest inventories and routinely empty them. A full chest (e.g., at (-15.5, -49.5)) can block output from inserters and disrupt mining operations."}
