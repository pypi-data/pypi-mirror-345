{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mine at position(37.0, -85.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (37.0, -85.0) and a Chest at position (36.5, -86.5) to store the mined coal. The coal is then transported to the inserter at position (36.5, -87.5) via the drop position.\n\n### Iron Plate Factory at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of a Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) to smelt iron ore into iron plates. The furnace also smelts copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Line at position(36.5, -87.5)\nConsists of multiple belts, including a belt at position (37.5, -87.5) connected to the inserter at position (36.5, -87.5), and another belt at position (38.5, -86.5) extending the belt line. The belts are used to transport items.\n\n### Assembling Machine at position(43.5, -86.5)\nConsists of an Assembling Machine at position (43.5, -86.5) connected to the power network via an Electricity Group. The Assembling Machine is set to craft copper cables.\n\n### Electricity Group at position(43.5, -86.5)\nConsists of multiple small electric poles, including poles at positions (40.5, -83.5), (41.5, -85.5), (42.5, -84.5), (43.5, -84.5), (45.5, -86.5), and (46.5, -83.5), which provide power to the Assembling Machine.\n\n### Steam Engine at position(40.5, -81.5)\nConsists of a Steam Engine at position (40.5, -81.5) which is not connected to the power network.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n* **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Remove any existing entities at the target position.\n* **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients**\n  - Ensure you have all the required ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft an item.\n* **Errors when placing entities due to insufficient inventory**\n  - Ensure you have the entity you want to place in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n* **Errors when inserting items into entities due to insufficient inventory**\n  - Ensure you have the item you want to insert in your inventory before attempting to insert it.\n* **Errors when using incorrect API calls**\n  - Ensure you are using the correct API calls for the action you want to perform. For example, use `insert_item` to insert items into entities, not `place_entity`.\n* **Errors when connecting entities due to missing required items**\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities.\n* **Errors when crafting items due to missing required sub-ingredients**\n  - Ensure you have all the required sub-ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. If a sub-ingredient requires a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace, ensure you have the necessary equipment and resources.\n* **Errors when placing entities due to distance**\n  - Ensure you are close enough to the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position if necessary.\n* **Errors when placing entities due to insufficient items in inventory**\n  - Ensure you have the required item in your inventory before attempting to place it. Craft or obtain the required item if necessary.\n* **Errors when crafting small electric poles due to missing wood**\n  - Ensure you have enough wood in your inventory to craft small electric poles. Wood is a raw resource that must be gathered first.\n* **Errors when crafting offshore pumps due to missing electronic circuits**\n  - Ensure you have all the required sub-ingredients to craft electronic circuits, which are required to craft offshore pumps.\n* **Errors when inserting copper plates into the furnace due to insufficient copper ore**\n  - Ensure you have enough copper ore in your inventory to smelt into copper plates.\n* **Errors when extracting copper cables due to no valid entity containing copper cables**\n  - Ensure that the Assembling Machine has crafted copper cables before attempting to extract them. Check the Assembling Machine's output and ensure it is set to craft copper cables.\n* **Errors when inserting copper ore into the furnace due to no copper ore in inventory**\n  - Ensure you have copper ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. Harvest or obtain copper ore if necessary."}
