{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Chest at position x=-14.5 y=-52.5\nConsists of a chest that contains 37 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting/inserting items into a chest\n- The agent is encountering a \"cannot access local variable 'x' where it is not associated with a value\" error when trying to extract items from its inventory and insert them into a chest. This suggests an issue with how the agent is referencing or passing variables within its item transfer logic. Review the code responsible for handling item transfers between the inventory and chests, paying close attention to variable scope and assignment.\n\n### Errors when placing a chest\n- The agent is failing to place a new chest at x=-13.5 y=-51.5 due to \"Placement conditions not met.\" This could be due to obstructions, incorrect tile targeting, or other placement restrictions. Ensure the target tile is accessible, unoccupied, and suitable for chest placement.\n\n### Errors when crafting a chest\n- The agent is failing to craft a wooden chest because it cannot craft wood. Wood is a raw resource that must be gathered first. The agent should ensure it has wood in its inventory before attempting to craft a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when harvesting wood\n- The agent is failing to harvest wood because the 'Inventory' object has no attribute 'player_position'. The agent needs to ensure the player position is correctly tracked and accessible when attempting to harvest wood.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- Inventory: Dict[str, int] = {'transport-belt': 6, 'coal': 600, 'iron-ore': 1800, 'copper-ore': 1289, 'iron-plate': 453}\n- Chest: Dict[str, int] = {'iron-plate': 37}\n"}
