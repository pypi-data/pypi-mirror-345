{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) which is currently out of ingredients to smelt and has a result inventory containing 100 iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) that stores iron ore (392 units).\n- Wooden Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) that stores iron ore (661 units) and iron plates (100 units).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) which is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full. It has 10,000 iron ore resources available.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting into the Stone Furnace without ingredients**\n  - Ensure that there are ingredients available to smelt in the Stone Furnace before attempting to insert items.\n\n- **Errors related to the Burner Mining Drill's drop position being full**\n  - Regularly check the inventory of the wooden chest at the drop position (-14.5, -48.5) and empty it to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue mining.\n\n- **Errors when extracting from the Wooden Chest**\n  - Make sure to extract items only when the chest has sufficient inventory space to avoid unnecessary extraction attempts.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Entity of type `BurnerMiningDrill` at position (-15.0, -50.0).\n  - `stone_furnace`: Entity of type `Furnace` at position (0.0, 0.0).\n  - `wooden_chest_1`: Entity of type `Chest` at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n  - `wooden_chest_2`: Entity of type `Chest` at position (2.5, 0.5).\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary of type `Inventory` containing items {'wood': 4, 'coal': 10, 'iron-ore': 5}."}
