{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Production Line at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-13.5, -50.5)\n- Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5) containing 14 iron plates\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5) containing 2 copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-23.5, -58.5)\n- Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5) containing 21 copper plates\n\n### Coal Production Line at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Output chest at (41.5, -80.5) containing 203 coal\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n### Incomplete Power Infrastructure\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Disconnected pipe groups at:\n  - (-13.5, 11.5) with 19 pipes\n  - (-14.5, 19.5) with 10 pipes\n  - (-9.5, 21.5) with 1 pipe\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Power Infrastructure Placement\n- Avoid placing boilers where they overlap with water tiles\n- Ensure there is enough clear space around water for the complete power setup (boiler + steam engine)\n- When placing connected entities, ensure they are within reasonable distance of each other\n\n### Errors with Entity Connections\n- Make sure you have enough pipes in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Place connected entities (like boiler and offshore pump) close enough to be connected with available pipes\n\n### Errors with Entity Removal\n- Verify entity exists at the target position before attempting to pick it up\n- Use correct API calls for removing different types of entities (PipeGroup vs individual entities)\n\n### Code/API Usage Errors\n- Use correct class names when checking entity types (PipeGroup was undefined)\n- Ensure all required classes and types are properly imported"}
