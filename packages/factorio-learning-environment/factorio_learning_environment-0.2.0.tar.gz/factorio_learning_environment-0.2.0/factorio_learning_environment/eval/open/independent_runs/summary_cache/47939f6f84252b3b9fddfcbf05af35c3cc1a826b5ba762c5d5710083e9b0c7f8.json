{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production (Position x=0-2)\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel:\n- Furnace 1 at position(0,0) processing iron ore with coal fuel\n- Furnace 2 at position(2,0) processing iron ore with coal fuel\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position x=4, y=4)\nSingle stone furnace processing copper ore with coal fuel\n\n### Electronic Circuit Assembly Line (Position x=6.5-12.5, y=11.5)\nAutomated assembly line consisting of:\n- Input wooden chest at position(6.5,11.5) containing iron plates and copper cables\n- Burner inserter at position(7.5,11.5) moving materials from input chest to assembler\n- Assembling machine at position(9.5,11.5) crafting electronic circuits\n- Burner inserter at position(11.5,11.5) moving finished products to output chest\n- Output wooden chest at position(12.5,11.5) storing electronic circuits\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=-9.5 to -2.5, y=22.5-26.5)\nSteam power setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5,24.5)\n- Pipe network carrying water from pump to boiler\n- Boiler at position(-7.0,24.5)\n- Steam pipe network connecting boiler to engine\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5,24.5)\n- Small electric poles distributing power\n\n### Research Lab Setup (Position y=28.5-31.5)\nAutomated research facility:\n- Lab at position(0.5,28.5)\n- Burner inserter at position(0.5,30.5)\n- Input chest at position(0.5,31.5) containing science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Crafting errors due to missing production facilities\n- Cannot craft copper cables and automation science packs directly - these require assembling machines or furnaces\n- Ensure proper production facilities are set up before attempting to craft items that require them\n\n### Resource shortage errors\n- Keep coal supplies stocked in boilers and burner inserters to prevent fuel shortages\n- Monitor and maintain fuel levels in all burner-powered entities\n\n### Assembly line material shortages\n- Electronic circuit production stalls due to missing copper cables\n- Ensure steady supply of input materials to keep assembly lines running efficiently"}
