{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates and input staging.\n- Burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), both fueled with coal, moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Inserters feeding the furnace and chests are maintained with coal, avoiding stoppage.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt drop position persists, limiting mining drill output.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved inserter fuel management and power connectivity, though output blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Steam engine connected to power network at (8.95, 13.05).\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), now connected to power network via small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) relocated and re-placed to free space for inserters.\n- Burner inserters at (22.5, 75.5) and (22.5, 77.5) newly placed and fueled, feeding assembling machine from input chests.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational, moving assembled iron gear wheels to output chest.\n- Assembling machine currently idle due to shortage of iron plates in its input inventory.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production, now properly powered and connected with inserters, but still awaiting sufficient input materials to operate.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous placement failures of small electric poles and burner inserters near assembling machine and output chest have been resolved by removing obstructing chests and repositioning inserters.\n- Always verify tile occupancy before placement to avoid conflicts.\n- Removing or relocating existing entities can create space for new inserters or poles.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are now consistently fueled, preventing stoppages.\n- Avoid overfilling inserter inventories to prevent insertion failures.\n- Regularly monitor inserter fuel levels and inventory status to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Output blockage and material flow issues\n- Furnace output belt blockage at (17.5, 72.5) persists, causing mining drill to wait for space.\n- Furnace output inventory often full, halting smelting progress.\n- Inserters feeding assembling machine report waiting for source items due to empty input inventory.\n- To mitigate, ensure output belts and chests downstream have capacity and are properly connected.\n- Consider expanding output storage or improving belt throughput to clear bottlenecks.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 is powered and connected but remains idle due to lack of iron plates in input inventory.\n- Ensure sufficient input materials are inserted into assembling machine input chest to enable crafting.\n- Maintain continuous supply of iron plates from smelting structure to assembly input.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent."}
