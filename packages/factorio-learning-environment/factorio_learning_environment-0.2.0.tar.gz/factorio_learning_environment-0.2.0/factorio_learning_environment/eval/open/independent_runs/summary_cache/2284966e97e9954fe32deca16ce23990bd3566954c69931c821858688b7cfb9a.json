{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with a current inventory of 24 iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with a current inventory of 24 iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (61.5, -52.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (62.5, -53.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (62.5, -52.5) containing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal as a resource.\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5) currently empty.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting more items than available\n- Ensure that the quantity specified for extraction does not exceed the available quantity in the entity. In this case, attempting to extract 100 iron plates from a furnace that does not contain that many resulted in an error.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. The inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) is waiting for source items, indicating that the source may be empty or not producing.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item(item_type, entity, quantity)`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from an entity. Failure occurs if the entity does not contain the specified quantity.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_plates_2`: Intended to store the result of extracting iron plates but failed due to insufficient quantity in the furnace.\n- Inventory variables: Track the current inventory of items such as 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
