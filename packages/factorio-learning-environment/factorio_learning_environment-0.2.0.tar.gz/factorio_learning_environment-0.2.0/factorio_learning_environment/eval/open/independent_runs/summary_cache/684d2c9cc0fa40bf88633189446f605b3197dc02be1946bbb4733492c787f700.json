{"content": "Based on the provided logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (Around position x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nComplex system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Storage chest system:\n  - Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) with coal storage capacity of 1600\n  - Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) as intermediate storage\n- Transport system:\n  - Chest inserter (x=42.5, y=-80.5) moving coal from wooden chest to belt\n  - Transport belt (x=43.5, y=-80.5) moving coal rightward\n  - Furnace inserter (x=43.5, y=-81.5) for furnace feeding\n\n### Furnace Setup (Around position x=45-49, y=-81)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n- Output storage:\n  - Wooden chest (x=49.5, y=-80.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Belt group running from (x=42.5, y=-68.5) to (x=42.5, y=-77.5)\n- Additional belt at (x=43.5, y=-80.5) moving rightward\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Always check if target location is clear before placing entities\n   - Multiple failed attempts to place burner-inserter due to existing objects\n   - Consider checking entity dimensions and required clearance before placement\n\n2. Transport System Bottlenecks\n   - Transport belt blocking detected at (43.5, -80.5)\n   - Ensure downstream systems can handle the input rate to prevent backups\n   - Consider adding more storage or improving throughput when belts get blocked\n\n3. Resource Management\n   - Monitor fuel levels in burner devices\n   - Watch for \"chest is full\" warnings to prevent system stalls\n   - Ensure proper fuel distribution across all burner entities\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the game world\n  - Success: When target location is clear\n  - Failure: When location is blocked or invalid\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter type\n- Mining drill fuel: Inventory type\n- Coal chest: Inventory type\n- Belt right inventory: Inventory type\n- Furnace fuel: Inventory type"}
