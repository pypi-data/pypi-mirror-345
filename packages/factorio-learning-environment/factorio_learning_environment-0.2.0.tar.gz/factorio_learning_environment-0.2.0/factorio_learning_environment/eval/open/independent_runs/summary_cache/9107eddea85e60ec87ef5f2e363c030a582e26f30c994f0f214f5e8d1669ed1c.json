(Step 8: 'oil_refinery' is not defined, Step 13: 'elect' is not defined, Step 29: bad operand type for unary -: 'type', Step 41: 'get_connection_amount' is not defined)\n\n### Errors when getting entities\n- Verify that entities exist at the specified position before attempting to access them. (Step 9: No entity of type oil-refinery found at the specified position, Step 19: No resource of type copper-ore at the specified location, Step 34: Could not get Prototype.ChemicalPlant at position x=0.0 y=0.0)\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that source entities have the required fluid before connecting to other entities. (Step 11: The source does not have fluid in it, Step 41: Did not find any valid connections between source Prototype.OffshorePump and target Prototype.Boiler)\n- Ensure that entities have a recipe set before connecting them. (Step 12: Cannot connect to a Prototype.OilRefinery until a recipe has been set)\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target location is not occupied by another entity or water before placing. (Previous report, Step 23: Cannot place electric-mining-drill at the target location - something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable, Step 24, Step 27, Step 43: Could not place pipe at (-8.5, -0.5), Step 53: Could not place inserter next to x=30.5 y=42.5, Step 54: Could not place inserter next to x=30.5 y=42.5, Step 55: Could not place inserter next to x=30.5 y=42.5)\n\n### Errors when finding buildable positions\n- Ensure that the BuildingBox size is not too large for the available space. (Step 25, Step 28: No viable place to put Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill near the centre position)\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available and can be crafted before attempting to craft an item. (Step 18: Could not craft solar-panel due to missing copper-plate, Step 47: cannot create sulfuric-acid due to a missing resources: iron-plate (1), sulfur (5))\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of objects\n- Check the type and attributes of objects before accessing them. (Step 42: 'Prototype' has no attribute 'PipeToGround', Step 51: 'Prototype' has no attribute 'PipeToGround', Step 52: 'pipe-to-ground')\n\n### Errors when assert"}
