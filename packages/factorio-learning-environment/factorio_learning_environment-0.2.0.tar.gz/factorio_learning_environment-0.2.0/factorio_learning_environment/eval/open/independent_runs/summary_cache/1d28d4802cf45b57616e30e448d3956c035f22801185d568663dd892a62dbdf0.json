{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Structure\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n  - Currently fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n  - Contains 11 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - Requires coal for operation.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and operational to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the inserter's alignment and fuel status.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured and fueled to deliver iron ore to the furnace. Check for obstructions and ensure the inserter's drop position is correctly set.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Regularly monitor the chest's inventory to prevent overflow. Extract items from the chest to maintain mining operations.\n\n### Inserter and Mining Drill Fuel Management\n- Keep the inserter and mining drill fueled with coal to ensure continuous operation. Regularly refuel to prevent disruptions.\n\n### Handling of Stale Entity Data\n- Be cautious of stale entity data warnings. Regularly update and verify entity data to ensure accurate operations and troubleshooting."}
