{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron and Copper Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, processing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring materials between the stone furnace and a wooden chest.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) with a warning for blocked transport belt at drop position.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5) with a warning for blocked furnace belt at drop position.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=2.5, y=0.5), (x=7.5, y=0.5), and (x=12.5, y=0.5) for storing processed materials.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) fueled with coal, extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=41.5, y=-83.5), and (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for storing coal and other materials.\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the wooden chests for material transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from exists and contains the expected items before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly offload items from your inventory to avoid reaching capacity, which prevents further harvesting or item collection.\n\n### Errors when offloading to non-existent or full chests\n- Verify that the target chest exists and has enough space to accommodate the items you are trying to offload.\n\n### Errors when inserters are blocked\n- Clear any blockages on transport belts or at drop positions to ensure smooth operation of inserters and prevent them from stalling."}
