{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) used for storing iron ore and other materials.\n- Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5) which transfers items from the chest to the stone furnace.\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution Network\nConsists of multiple wooden chests positioned as follows:\n- Chests at positions (77.5, -121.5), (81.5, -121.5), (85.5, -121.5), (89.5, -121.5), (93.5, -121.5), (97.5, -121.5), (101.5, -121.5), (105.5, -121.5), (109.5, -121.5), (113.5, -121.5), (117.5, -121.5), (121.5, -121.5), (128.5, -121.5), (75.5, -119.5), (74.5, -117.5), (73.5, -115.5), (72.5, -113.5), (71.5, -111.5), (70.5, -109.5), (69.5, -107.5), (68.5, -106.5), (67.5, -105.5), (66.5, -104.5), (65.5, -103.5), (64.5, -102.5), (62.5, -100.5), (63.5, -101.5), (60.5, -98.5), (61.5, -99.5), (58.5, -96.5), (59.5, -97.5), (55.5, -94.5), (57.5, -95.5), (56.5, -94.5), (53.5, -93.5), (52.5, -92.5), (54.5, -93.5), (51.5, -91.5), (50.5, -90.5), (49.5, -89.5), (48.5, -88.5), (47.5, -87.5), (46.5, -86.5), (39.5, -84.5), (38.5, -84.5), (41.5, -84.5), (40.5, -84.5), (43.5, -84.5), (42.5, -84.5), (45.5, -85.5), (44.5, -84.5), (40.5, -83.5).\n- These chests are used for storing coal and distributing it across the map.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. Consider using multiple storage units or upgrading to larger capacity chests.\n\n### Errors when inserting items not present in inventory\n- Verify that the items you are trying to insert are available in your inventory before executing the insert operation.\n\n### Errors when extracting from an invalid entity\n- Confirm that the entity you are trying to extract from exists and contains the required items. Check the entity's status and position before extraction.\n\n### Errors related to nil value indexing\n- Ensure that all variables and entities are properly initialized and accessible before attempting to access their properties or methods.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item, target, quantity)`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target container. Ensure the item exists in the inventory and the target has space.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_chest`: Represents the chest used for storing iron ore. Type: Container\n- `harvested_iron_ore`: Represents the amount of iron ore harvested. Type: Integer\n- `iron_ore_to_add`: Represents the amount of iron ore intended to be added to a chest. Type: Integer"}
