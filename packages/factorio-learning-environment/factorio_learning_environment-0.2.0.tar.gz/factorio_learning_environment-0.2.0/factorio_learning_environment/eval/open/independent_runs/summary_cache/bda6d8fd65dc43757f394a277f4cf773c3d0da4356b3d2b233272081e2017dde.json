{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures successfully placed on the map. All attempts to place wooden chests have failed due to obstructions or errors, and no other structures have been created.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Ensure the target tile is free of obstructions before attempting to place a chest. The logs indicate repeated attempts to place chests in obstructed areas or areas with stale entity data.\n\n### Errors with data types and function calls\n- When using data types, ensure that the correct type is being used. An error was encountered with the `BuildingBox` where a type mismatch occurred. Review the expected data types and ensure they match the function or class requirements.\n- Avoid calling objects that are not callable. A `TypeError` was encountered when attempting to call a `Position` object. Ensure that only callable objects (like functions) are used with parentheses.\n\n### Resource availability errors\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources available for operations. The logs indicate that there is no iron ore available to supply to furnaces. Regularly check and replenish resources to prevent production halts."}
