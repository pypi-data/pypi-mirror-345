{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel (coal: 13), input (iron-ore: 8), and output (iron-plate: 124)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Ensure you have all required sub-ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, to craft a Burner Mining Drill, you need iron plates and iron gear wheels, which in turn require iron plates. Additionally, crafting iron gear wheels requires iron plates, which must be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before inserting them into an entity. For example, you cannot insert iron ore into the Stone Furnace if you do not have any iron ore available.\n\n### Errors when smelting\n- Check that the Stone Furnace has enough fuel and input materials. If you encounter a \"Smelting timeout - check fuel and inputs\" error, it indicates that the furnace is not receiving the necessary resources to operate.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect types in function calls\n- Ensure that the correct type of argument is passed to functions. For example, when inserting items, the second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position.\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any entity. For example, if you receive an error stating \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory,\" it indicates that you need to gather more iron ore before trying again.\n\n### Errors when the furnace has no ingredients\n- If the furnace indicates \"no ingredients to smelt,\" ensure that there are sufficient input materials available for smelting.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items while inventory is empty\n- Ensure that you have gathered enough items before attempting to insert them into the Stone Furnace. If you receive an error stating \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory,\" it indicates that you need to collect more iron ore.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into the furnace\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the Stone Furnace. If you receive an error stating \"No coal to insert from your inventory,\" it indicates that you need to gather more coal before trying again.\n\n### Errors related to crafting iron gear wheels\n- Ensure you have enough iron plates in your inventory before attempting to craft iron gear wheels. If you receive an error stating that you cannot craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates, it indicates that you need to smelt more iron plates in the furnace.\n\n### Errors when the furnace inventory is full\n- If you receive an error stating \"Inventory is full,\" ensure that the furnace has enough space to accept new items before attempting to insert them.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract items from the furnace\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the required items to extract. If you receive an error stating \"Could not find a valid stone-furnace entity containing iron-plate,\" it indicates that there are no iron plates available for extraction.\n\n### Errors when the furnace has insufficient fuel\n- If you receive a warning stating \"The furnace needs more coal,\" ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory and insert it into the furnace to keep it operational."}
