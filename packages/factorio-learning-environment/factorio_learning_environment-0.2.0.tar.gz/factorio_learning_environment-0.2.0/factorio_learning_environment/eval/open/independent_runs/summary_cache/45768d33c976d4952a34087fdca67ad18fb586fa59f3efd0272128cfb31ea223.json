{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently working and using coal as fuel.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) containing coal.\n\n### Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is currently out of fuel and unable to operate. It is set to drop resources into the wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when the burner mining drill is out of fuel**\n  - Ensure that the burner mining drill has adequate fuel to operate. Check the fuel inventory and refill as necessary.\n  \n- **Errors when the wooden chest is full**\n  - The burner mining drill cannot drop resources if the wooden chest is full. Regularly empty the chest to allow for continued mining operations.\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace**\n  - Make sure the furnace has enough fuel and is not overloaded with items before attempting to insert more materials.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None defined in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus"}
