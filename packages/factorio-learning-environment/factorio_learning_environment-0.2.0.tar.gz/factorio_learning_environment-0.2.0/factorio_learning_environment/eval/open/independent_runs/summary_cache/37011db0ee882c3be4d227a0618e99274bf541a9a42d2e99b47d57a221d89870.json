{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (7.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (7.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-0.5, 22.0)\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler to the steam engine with pipes at positions including (x=-0.5, y=21.5), (x=1.5, y=21.5), (x=0.5, y=21.5), ..., (x=4.5, y=21.5), (x=7.5, y=21.5), (x=6.5, y=21.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions including (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), (x=24.5, y=22.5), ..., (x=26.5, y=17.5), (x=30.5, y=17.5), (x=20.5, y=19.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Entity Pickup\n- Ensure that when using `pickup_entity`, if the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None. Avoid providing a position as the second argument in such cases.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement\n- Verify that the target location for placing an entity is clear of obstructions and suitable for placement. This includes ensuring the terrain is appropriate and there are no existing objects in the way.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- When retrieving an entity using `get_entity`, ensure that the entity exists at the specified position. Double-check the entity type and position to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### Errors in Assertion for Power Generation\n- Ensure that the steam engine is correctly connected and receiving power. Verify that all components of the electricity generator are properly configured and operational to avoid assertion errors related to power generation.\n\n### Errors Due to Distance Limitations\n- When placing entities such as pipes, ensure that the player is within the maximum allowable distance from the target position. Move closer to the target if necessary to avoid distance-related errors."}
