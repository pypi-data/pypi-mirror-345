{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction Structure at position (20.5, 43.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (position: x=20.5, y=43.5)\n- Boiler (position: x=15.5, y=44.0)\n- Steam Engine (position: x=11.5, y=44.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting pumpjack to oil refinery (positions: x=21.5 y=41.5, x=23.5 y=41.5, ..., x=24.5 y=50.5, x=27.5 y=50.5, x=26.5 y=50.5)\n- ElectricityGroup connecting steam engine to pumpjack and oil refinery (poles at positions: x=11.5 y=46.5, x=15.5 y=46.5, x=22.5 y=45.5, x=23.5 y=44.5, x=19.5 y=46.5)\n\n### Oil Refinery Structure at position (26.5, 46.5)\nConsists of:\n- Oil Refinery (position: x=26.5, y=46.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using entities without proper setup or connection\n- Ensure that entities like pumpjacks and oil refineries are properly connected to power networks and have the necessary inputs (e.g., crude oil for oil refineries, fuel for boilers).\n- Make sure that entities are not placed too close to each other to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before they are used. For example, 'offshore_pump' and 'storage_tank' were used without being defined.\n\n### Errors when asserting entity status\n- Check the status of entities after placing or connecting them. For example, the pumpjack and oil refinery were not working due to lack of power or improper connections.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n\n* `place_entity_next_to(entity_type, reference_position, direction) -> Entity`: Places an entity of the given type next to the reference position in the specified direction. \n    + Failure modes: \n        - Could not place entity due to collision with existing entities or invalid placement position.\n    + Success modes: \n        - Successfully placed the entity.\n* `get_entity(entity_type, position) -> Entity`: Retrieves an entity of the given type at the specified position.\n    + Failure modes: \n        - No entity of the given type found at the specified position.\n    + Success modes: \n        - Successfully retrieved the entity.\n\n### Important Variables\n\n* `pumpjack`: Pumpjack entity (type: Entity)\n* `oil_refinery`: Oil Refinery entity (type: Entity)\n* `boiler`: Boiler entity (type: Entity)\n* `steam_engine`: Steam Engine entity (type: Entity)"}
