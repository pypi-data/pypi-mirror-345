# PyGridSim

PyGridSim is a package for simulating OpenDSS circuits. PyGridSim uses a functional interface to allow users to efficiently generate circuits of various scopes.

- Documentation: https://dtail.gitbook.io/pygridsim
- Homepage: https://github.com/DAI-Lab/PyGridSim/ 

# Overview

PyGridSim allows users to create and customize circuits. Users can either fully specify each component they add to the circuit, or lean on library-provided parameter sets. PyGridSim supports the batch creation of every circuit component, emphasizing scalability and efficiently in building large circuits.

# Installation

## Requirements

**PyGridSim** has been developed and tested on [Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Also, although it is not strictly required, the usage of a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
is highly recommended in order to avoid interfering with other software installed in the system
in which **PyGridSim** is run.

These are the minimum commands needed to create a virtualenv using python3.10 for **PyGridSim**:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p $(which python3.10) PyGridSim-venv
```

Afterwards, you have to execute this command to activate the virtualenv:

```bash
source PyGridSim-venv/bin/activate
```

Remember to execute it every time you start a new console to work on **PyGridSim**!

<!-- Uncomment this section after releasing the package to PyPI for installation instructions
## Install from PyPI

After creating the virtualenv and activating it, we recommend using
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) in order to install **PyGridSim**:

```bash
pip install pygridsim
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
-->

## Install from source

With your virtualenv activated, you can clone the repository and install it from
source by running `make install` on the `stable` branch:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:amzhao/PyGridSim.git
cd PyGridSim
git checkout stable
make install
```

# Quick Start
Users of PyGridSim have the option between creating a fully customized circuit and using PyGridSim-provided parameters to build their circuit. Consider the simplest circuit: one source, one load, and a line connecting them. The following code snippet demonstrates how to model and print results on this circuit on PyGridSim with both methods.

## Customized Circuit Creation
```python
from pygridsim import PyGridSim
circuit = PyGridSim()

# Add Custom Source and Load
circuit.add_load_nodes(params={"kV": 0.12, "kW": 1, "kvar": 1})
circuit.update_source(params={"kV": 0.5})

# Add Line
circuit.add_lines([("source", "load0")], params={"length": 1})

# Solve and Print Results
circuit.solve()
print(circuit.results(["Voltages", "Losses"]))
circuit.clear()
```

Running this code yields the following printed output:
```
{'Voltages': {'source': 499.7123955784113, 'load0': 120.73408045756985}, 'Losses': {'Active Power Loss': 465617.30157676246, 'Reactive Power Loss': 969502.2898991327}}
```

Note that the losses here are expressed in Watts, and the Voltages in Volts. The circuit observes some loss due to a much higher source voltage than load voltage, with most of the loss being reactive power loss. The circuit is created with a step-down transformer in the line by default, which enables the source and load to maintain isolated voltage levels at rest.

## Defaults-Based Circuit Creation
```python
from pygridsim import PyGridSim
circuit = PyGridSim()

# Add Custom Source and Load
circuit.add_load_nodes(load_type="house")
circuit.update_source(source_type="turbine")

# Add Line
circuit.add_lines([("source", "load0")], line_type="lv")

# Solve and Print Results
circuit.solve()
print(circuit.results(["Voltages", "Losses"]))
circuit.clear()
```

The following output is printed:
```
{'Voltages': {'source': 2418.845494533779, 'load0': 169.53107121049976}, 'Losses': {'Active Power Loss': 351310.95859906287, 'Reactive Power Loss': 730351.7183868886}}
```

The defaults-based ranges for source and load nodes are higher than the ones specified in the above customization example, explaining the higher voltages set for both nodes. We once again observe some loss in the system, with most of that being in reactive power loss.
