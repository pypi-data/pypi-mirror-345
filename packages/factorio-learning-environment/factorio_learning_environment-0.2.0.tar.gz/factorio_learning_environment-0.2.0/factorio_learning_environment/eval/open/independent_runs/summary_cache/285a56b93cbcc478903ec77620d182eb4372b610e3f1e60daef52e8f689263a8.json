{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Lab and Power Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to the power network.\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions [(x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5)] providing power.\n\n### Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) used for smelting iron ore and copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using undefined entities\n- Ensure that all entities used in the code are properly defined and imported. For example, 'Lab' was not defined, causing a NameError.\n\n### Errors with pipe connections\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected between entities. There were multiple failures to connect pipes from the offshore pump to the boiler and from the boiler to the steam engine. Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory and that the pipes are placed correctly.\n\n### Errors with steam engine not working\n- Make sure the steam engine is connected to a working boiler and has a supply of steam. There were assertion errors indicating the steam engine was not working.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Keep track of your inventory to ensure you have enough resources, such as coal, to refuel entities like the boiler. There were instances where there was not enough coal to refuel the boiler.\n\n### Errors with power network\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the power network. There was an error indicating that the lab was not connected to the power network initially.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status of all entities to ensure they are working as expected and troubleshoot any warnings or errors promptly."}
