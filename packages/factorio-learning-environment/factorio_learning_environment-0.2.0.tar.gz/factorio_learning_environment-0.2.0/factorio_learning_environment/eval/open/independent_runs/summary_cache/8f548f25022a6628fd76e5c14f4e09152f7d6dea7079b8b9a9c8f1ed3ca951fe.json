Check the inventory capacity and current load to prevent overflow errors.\n\n### Attribute Error with Chest Object\n- Verify that the object you are trying to manipulate has the correct attributes. In this case, the 'Chest' object does not have a 'drop_position' attribute. Ensure you're using the correct method or attribute for the object type.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters with Full Source\n- Avoid trying to insert items into a source that is already full. Regularly check and manage inventory levels to prevent inserters from stalling due to full inventories."}
