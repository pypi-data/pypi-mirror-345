{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(1.5, 0.0)\nConsists of steam engine (position 1.5, 0.0), boiler (position 1.5, 0.0), and offshore pump (not yet placed).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(4.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a furnace at position (4.0, -62.0).\n\n### Lab at position(0.5, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position 0.5, 2.5) which is currently not powered.\n\n### Electricity group at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Small electric poles at positions (2.5, 0.5), (2.5, 2.5), (3.5, 0.5), and (1.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a target location before attempting to place it. For example, the error with placing the boiler indicates that something is obstructing the position (1.5, 0.0).\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors related to the ElectricityGroup object\n- Review the usage of the ElectricityGroup object to ensure it is being accessed correctly, as it appears to be incorrectly referenced in the connection check."}
