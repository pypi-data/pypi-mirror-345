# PDKMaster based Sky130 PDK

This is the PDK for Sky130 based on the [PDKMaster](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/PDKMaster) framework. It currently is basically undocumented. Development is driven by sky130 MPW shuttle development.
A little more information on what is possible can be found in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

In the [`v0.1`](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-sky130/-/tree/v0.1) branch a SRAM block and some analog circuits were present. These blocks did not work anymore with updated [PDKMaster](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/PDKMaster) and [c4m-flexcell](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-flexcell) modules. These blocks have therefor been removed from the main branch. Furhter development is not done in the [`sram`](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-sky130/-/tree/sram) and the [`analog`](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-sky130/-/tree/analog) branch.

## Release history

* [v0.2.6](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-sky130/-/commits/v0.2.7):
  * Update for API changes in PDKMaster and c4m-flexio.
  * Reworked dependency handling for building the package.
* [v0.2.6](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-sky130/-/commits/v0.2.6):
  * build setup improvements
  * update dependencies to latest release version
* [v0.2.5](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-sky130/-/commits/v0.2.5):
  * use common doit support from PDKMaster and pdkmaster.io.klayout
  * signoff related fixes
* [v0.2.4](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-sky130/-/commits/v0.2.4):
  * patch generation for upstreaming to alliance-check-toolkit and update file generation to changes in that repo.
  * provide scaled down standard cell library with dimensions not based on lambda rules
  * add 5V standard cell library
* [v0.2.3](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-sky130/-/commits/v0.2.3):
  * Subproject of project Arrakeen
  * CI improvements
  * Improved module load time though lazy library creation
  * Spice netlist generation improvements
* [v0.2.2](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/c4m-pdk-sky130/-/commits/v0.2.2): build infrastructure and dependencies update; no major code changes but KLayout PCell lib support added.
* v0.2.1: Switch to latest version of PDKMaster and c4m-flexcell. As these updates break the SRAM and analog circuits they have been removed from this stable branch. `v0.1` branch is available using old version of these modules and with the SRAM block and the analog circuits.
Development of SRAM and analog blocks is done in separate branches `sram` and `analog`. Development in these branches will be merged again in upstream as they are fixed.  
Intermediate development was done on a `v0.2.0` dev branch.
* v0.1.5: Update bandgap model support, update analog python notebooks.
* v0.1.4: No code changes; update dependencies for latest bug fixes
* v0.1.3: No code change; use PDKMaster 0.9.2 to get Coriolis export compatible with namespace of
  latest Coriolis release.
* v0.1.2: Fix Coriolis export.
* v0.1.1: No code change; release files now built by CI.
* v0.1.0: Update for [release v0.9.0 of PDKMaster](https://gitlab.com/Chips4Makers/PDKMaster/-/blob/v0.9.0/ReleaseNotes/v0.9.0.md)
* no notes for older releases
