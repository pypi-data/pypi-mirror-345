Check for any obstacles or incorrect placements that may prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to missing resources\n- When attempting to create items, ensure that you have all required resources in your inventory. Check the recipe requirements and gather missing items before proceeding."}
