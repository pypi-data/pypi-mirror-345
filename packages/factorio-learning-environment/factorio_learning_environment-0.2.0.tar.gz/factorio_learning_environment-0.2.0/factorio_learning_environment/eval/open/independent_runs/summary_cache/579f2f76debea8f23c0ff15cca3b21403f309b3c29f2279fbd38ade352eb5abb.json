Remove any existing entities at the target position if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Entity Type Checking\n- When using `isinstance()` for type checking, ensure the second argument is a type, tuple of types, or a union. Correctly reference the entity type, such as `entities.Lab` instead of `Lab`.\n\n### Errors with Undefined References\n- Ensure all entity references are defined in the current scope. For example, use `entities.Lab` instead of `Lab` to avoid `NameError`.\n\n### Errors with Attribute Access\n- Avoid accessing attributes on incorrect data types. Ensure the object is of the correct type before accessing its attributes, such as not using a list where an entity object is expected."}
