{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and is refueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5): Used for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5): Stores the produced iron plates and additional iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5): Transfers items between the chests and the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to move items from source to destination. Check for any blockages or full inventories that might prevent operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Output\n- Regularly monitor the furnace output to ensure it is not full. If the output is full, remove items to allow continuous production.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fuel Management\n- Keep inserters adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check and refuel as necessary to prevent stoppages."}
