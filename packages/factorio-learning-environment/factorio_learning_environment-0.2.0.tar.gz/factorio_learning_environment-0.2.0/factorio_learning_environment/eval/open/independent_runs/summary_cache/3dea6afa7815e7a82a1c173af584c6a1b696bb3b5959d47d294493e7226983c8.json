{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring coal to the furnace.\n\n### Additional Iron Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with iron ore being processed.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0) with iron ore being processed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory, as seen in the attempt to insert iron ore into the furnace.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping. This will ensure continuous operation of mining drills and prevent the warning \"chest at drop position is full.\"\n\n### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning. Regularly check and supply furnaces with the required materials to maintain production efficiency."}
