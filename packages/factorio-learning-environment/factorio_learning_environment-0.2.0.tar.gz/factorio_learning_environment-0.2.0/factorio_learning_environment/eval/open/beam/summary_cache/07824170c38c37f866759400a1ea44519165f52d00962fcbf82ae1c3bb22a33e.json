{"content": "The persistent `NameError` for `random` suggests that the import statement might not be recognized due to the environment setup or execution context. Let's try a different approach to ensure the `random` module is available:\n\n1. **Ensure the import statement is at the very top of the script**: This is already done, but double-check to make sure there are no typos or issues with the import statement itself.\n\n2. **Check the execution environment**: Ensure that the environment where the script is being executed supports the `random` module. If this is a restricted environment, it might not allow certain imports.\n\n3. **Use a workaround if the import is not working**: If the `random` module cannot be imported, you can manually implement a simple random number generator using basic arithmetic operations. However, this is not ideal and should only be used if absolutely necessary.\n\nHere's a version of the script that includes a simple workaround for generating random numbers:\n\n```python\n# Attempt to import the random module\ntry:\n    import random\nexcept ImportError:\n    # Define a simple random number generator if import fails\n    def simple_random():\n        # Use a basic linear congruential generator (LCG) for demonstration\n        a, c, m = 1664525, 1013904223, 2**32\n        seed = 42  # Example seed value\n        while True:\n            seed = (a * seed + c) % m\n            yield seed / m\n\n    random_gen = simple_random()\n\n    # Define a function to mimic random.uniform\n    def random_uniform(low, high):\n        return low + (high - low) * next(random_gen)\n\n    # Use random_uniform instead of random.uniform\n    random = type('Random', (), {'uniform': random_uniform})()\n\n# Function to ensure entity placement\ndef ensure_entity_placement(prototype, position=None):\n    \"\"\"Ensure that a given entity is placed.
