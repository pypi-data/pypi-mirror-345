{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5) - working\n- Boiler at position(-5.0, 2.5) - working with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position(0.5, 6.5) - working but shows \"not connected to power network\" warning\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole at position(0.5, 8.5) and position(4.5, 6.5) connected to the steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position(19.5, 71.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 at position(16.5, 71.5) - working with low power\n- Electric mining drill 2 at position(19.5, 71.5) - working with low power but chest is full\n- Electric mining drill 3 at position(22.5, 71.5) - working with low power\n- Small electric poles at positions(14.5, 70.5) and (24.5, 73.5) providing power\n- Wooden chest at position(16.5, 73.5) collecting ore from drill 1 (contains 62 iron ore)\n- Wooden chest at position(19.5, 73.5) collecting ore from drill 2 (contains 39 iron ore)\n- Wooden chest at position(22.5, 73.5) collecting ore from drill 3 (contains 62 iron ore)\n- Multiple belt groups connecting the mining area to the furnaces\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area at Position(25.5, 84.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric furnace 1 at position(22.5, 84.5) - working with low power\n  - Contains 35 iron ore and 30 iron plates\n- Electric furnace 2 at position(25.5, 84.5) - working with low power\n  - Contains 36 iron ore and 27 iron plates\n- Electric furnace 3 at position(28.5, 84.5) - working with low power\n  - Contains 36 iron ore and 24 iron plates\n- Connected to the electricity network\n\n### Steel Plate Production Area at Position(29.5, 95.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric furnace 1 at position(26.5, 95.5) - working with low power\n  - Contains 10 iron plates and 11 steel plates\n- Electric furnace 2 at position(29.5, 95.5) - not connected to power\n  - Contains 80 iron plates\n- Electric furnace 3 at position(32.5, 95.5) - not connected to power\n  - Contains 80 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with belts\n- When using `connect_entities()`, ensure there is a valid path between the start and end positions\n- The error \"Not a valid path to normalise\" indicates the path is too complex or impossible to create\n- Try creating shorter, simpler belt paths or use underground belts for longer distances\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing an entity\n- Use `get_entities()` to check for existing entities at a location before placing new ones\n- Clear existing entities with `pickup()` before attempting to place new ones at the same position\n\n### Power connection issues\n- The steam engine shows \"not connected to power network\" despite having small electric poles nearby\n- Ensure all electrical entities are properly connected in a continuous network\n- The third steel furnace consistently fails to connect to power - try placing additional poles or repositioning existing ones\n- When connecting entities with `connect_entities()`, ensure the entities are within connection range\n\n### Fluid connection issues\n- When connecting fluid-carrying entities like boilers and steam engines, ensure a direct and valid pipe path\n- The error \"Did not find any valid connections between source and target\" indicates the pipe layout is invalid\n- Try creating a simpler, more direct pipe path between fluid entities\n\n### Inventory errors\n- \"Could not extract iron-ore: attempt to index field character (a nil value)\" indicates an issue with the extraction API\n- When trying to place entities that aren't in inventory (like long-handed inserters), check inventory first\n- \"Chest at drop position is full"}
