It remains at position (0.0, 0.0) and continues to serve as the central processing structure for converting ore into metal plates.\n\n### Lab with Power Connection at position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab positioned at (10.5, 0.5) intended for Automation Technology research. (Note: It is currently not receiving power.)\n- Small Electric Pole placed at (10.5, -1.5) connected to the Lab to provide power.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Inventory shortages when powering or crafting critical components  \n  - Confirm that prerequisite power items (e.g. Small Electric Poles) are available in the inventory before attempting to power a structure.\n  - Ensure raw resources (e.g. wood) are gathered prior to requesting the crafting of items that require them.\n\n\u2022 Furnace output delays and timeout issues  \n  - Verify furnace conditions and fuel levels to reduce waiting attempts for smelting outputs.\n  - Monitor the furnace\u2019s production rate to avoid timeouts and ensure sufficient material throughput.\n\n\u2022 SteamEngine crafting failures due to insufficient iron-plates  \n  - Before attempting to craft a SteamEngine, ensure that the required iron-plates have been adequately produced either through smelting or are available in inventory.\n  - Recheck available quantities and ensure the furnace has completed processing to meet the recipe requirements.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and research prerequisite issues (from previous steps)  \n  - For assembling machine crafting and automation research, verify that necessary technology and resource inputs are available to prevent stalling of operations."}
