{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory of coal, working status, and connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storage.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers items from the chests to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace at (-12.0, -48.0) is currently working, while the furnace at (-10.0, -48.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5) and (-11.5, -46.5) to facilitate item transfer between entities.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Auxiliary Storage and Transfer\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -46.5), (-7.5, -47.5), and (-6.5, -47.5) for additional storage and item transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters are correctly aligned and have access to source items. Regularly check and realign inserters if necessary.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have a continuous supply of iron ore. Regularly check the supply chain from mining drills to furnaces to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Maintain a sufficient coal supply for all burner-operated entities. Regularly refuel mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there is enough space in chests to store produced items to prevent production halts due to full inventories."}
