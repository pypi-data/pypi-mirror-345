{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently fueled with coal and actively smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5): Transfers iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5): Collects iron plates from the burner inserter. Currently contains iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (4.5, 0.5): Positioned to transfer items from a belt to a chest, though currently not connected to any belt system.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces or crafting items.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Chests\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to a wooden chest. Use an inserter to input items into the chest.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no blocking entities when placing new entities like burner inserters. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to place or craft items, verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory to avoid errors related to missing items.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Sub-Ingredients\n- Some items require sub-ingredients that cannot be crafted manually and need specific machines. Ensure you have access to the necessary machines or items before crafting complex items."}
