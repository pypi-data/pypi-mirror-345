{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (-12.0, -48.0), processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (-10.0, -48.0), processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5) and (-8.5, -47.5) managing the transfer of materials between the furnaces and chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -47.5), and (-6.5, -47.5) for storing processed iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Storage Chest** at position (-6.5, -48.5) containing 1246 iron plates.\n- **Inserter 2** at position (-11.5, -45.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors due to unbound local variables\n- Always initialize variables before using them in expressions or function calls to prevent unbound local variable errors.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that source items are available for inserters to operate efficiently.\n\n### Inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter.\n\n### Furnace output full\n- Regularly transfer items from furnaces to storage to prevent production halts due to full output inventory.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect argument types\n- Ensure that the correct types of arguments are passed to functions, such as passing an Entity or Position object where required, to avoid ValueError."}
