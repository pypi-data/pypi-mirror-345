{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which is responsible for extracting iron ore. It is currently fueled with coal and is operational.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore. The chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) is full, which may hinder further mining operations.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which processes the iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal and is operational.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently waiting for source items to continue operation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest\n- Ensure that the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) is regularly emptied to prevent the mining drill from stopping due to lack of space.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Always maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and other fuel-dependent structures to avoid operational downtime.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operation\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to source items and is correctly positioned to pick up and drop items between entities. Regularly check and clear any blockages in the flow of items."}
