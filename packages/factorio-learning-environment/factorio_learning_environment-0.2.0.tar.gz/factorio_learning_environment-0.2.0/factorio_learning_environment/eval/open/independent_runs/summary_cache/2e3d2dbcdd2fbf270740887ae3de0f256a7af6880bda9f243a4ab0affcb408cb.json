{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, dropping into a chest at position (41.5, -80.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) connected to the mining drill.\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n- Additional Iron Chests at positions (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) storing various resources including coal and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -78.5) connected to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, dropping into a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-12.5, -49.5) and (-9.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that your inventory has enough space before attempting to extract or harvest resources. Consider crafting items to free up space if necessary.\n\n### Errors When Clearing Chests\n- Verify that the chest is not full before attempting to extract items. If the chest is full, transfer items to another storage or use them to prevent extraction failures.\n\n### Errors When Supplying Furnaces\n- Ensure you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to supply furnaces. Check your inventory for iron ore availability before supplying.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to transfer items. Check that the source and destination entities are correctly positioned and not obstructed.\n\n### Errors with Resource Supply\n- Regularly check and maintain resource levels in your furnaces and drills to prevent interruptions in production."}
