{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with connections at various positions including (x=18.5, y=-10.5) and (x=19.5, y=-2.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with a fuel supply of coal.\n- Pipe Group at Position (x=5.5, y=-8.5) for water supply.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a fuel supply of coal.\n\n### Inserter and Storage Area\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) waiting for source items and not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5) for storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, make sure you have coal in your inventory before trying to refuel a boiler.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Check the power connections to ensure that inserters are receiving electricity. Make sure that electric poles are properly connected and powered.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply lines and inventory to confirm that raw materials are available for processing."}
