Check the expected water and steam pipe paths and ensure they are correctly placed.\n\n### Fuel Management for Boiler\n- Ensure the boiler has sufficient fuel, such as coal, to operate effectively. Regularly check and refill the fuel as needed.\n\n### Inventory Management for Crafting and Placement\n- Verify that the required items, such as small electric poles, are available in the inventory before attempting to place them. Craft necessary items if they are not present.\n\n### Electricity Network Connection\n- Ensure that the electricity network is properly connected and that all entities needing power are plugged into the network. Check the status of the electricity group and resolve any disconnections.\n\n### Pipe Placement and Alignment\n- Re-evaluate pipe alignment to ensure proper connection paths for both water and steam. Adjust placement if necessary to achieve the desired connection."}
