{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Currently disconnected from power network (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Power Generation Plant at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-5.5, 0.0) heated by coal\n- Steam engine at (-0.5, 0.5) generating electricity\n- Connected pipe network for water/steam transfer\n- Currently producing 141 steam/second\n\n### New Smelting Setup at (25.0, 79.0)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (25.5, 75.5)\n- Stone furnace at (25.0, 79.0)\n- Input burner inserter at (25.5, 77.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (27.5, 79.5)\n- Output burner inserter at (26.5, 79.5)\n- Currently non-functional due to:\n  - Mining drill power issues\n  - Inserter alignment problems\n\n### Secondary Smelting Setup at (20.0, 73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (20.5, 70.5)\n- Stone furnace at (20.0, 73.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (22.5, 73.5)\n- Missing input inserter configuration\n\n### New Mining Operation at (20.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (20.5, 20.5)\n- Currently unconnected to any processing chain\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Water Placement Issues\n- Multiple failed attempts to place entities in water (steps 26,27,29,31)\n- Critical solution: \n  - Always verify target position is land before placement\n  - Use debug tools to check terrain type when placement fails\n  - Implement proper position validation before build attempts\n\n### Inserter Placement Failures\n- Continuing issues with inserter placement (steps 24,25)\n- Required checks:\n  - Verify 0.5 tile clearance around target position\n  - Ensure inserter can reach both source and destination\n  - Check for existing entities in placement area\n\n### Missing Module Import\n- Attempt to use math module without import (step 28)\n- Always verify required imports are present before use\n- Standard imports should be declared at script start\n\n### Entity Access Errors\n- Attempt to access non-existent mining drill (step 30)\n- Always verify entity exists before interaction\n- Implement error handling for missing entities\n\n### Power Network Problems\n- Mining drills remain unpowered despite available electricity\n- Solution: \n  1. Verify power pole coverage spans all production buildings\n  2. Check pole connection distances (max 7.5 tiles)\n  3. Ensure power plant has sufficient generation capacity\n\n### Production Chain Verification\n- Multiple non-functional production chains\n- Always verify:\n  1. Power supply to all electric devices\n  2. Fuel in all burner devices\n  3. Correct inserter alignment\n  4. Material flow through entire chain\n\n### Boiler Fuel Issues\n- Boiler warnings about being out of fuel\n- Implement regular fuel checks for burner devices\n- Consider automated fuel delivery systems\n\n### Entity Spacing Problems\n- Continuing placement failures due to insufficient space\n- Critical spacing rules:\n  - Minimum 0.5 tile clearance around all entities\n  - Larger machines need 1+ tile buffers\n  - Plan layouts with adequate spacing before placement"}
