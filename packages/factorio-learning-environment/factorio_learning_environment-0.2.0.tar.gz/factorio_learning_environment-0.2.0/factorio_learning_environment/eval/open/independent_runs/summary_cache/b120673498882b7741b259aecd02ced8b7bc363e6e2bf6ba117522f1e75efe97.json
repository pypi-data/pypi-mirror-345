{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch. Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore. It is often full or low on iron ore, which indicates a bottleneck in the processing chain.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It requires regular refueling with coal and has been repositioned multiple times to ensure proper alignment.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates. It is currently not receiving iron ore due to issues with the inserter setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Setup Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Regularly check and adjust the inserter setup to maintain a smooth flow of materials.\n\n### Fuel Management for Entities\n- Keep a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Regularly harvest coal from nearby resources to avoid interruptions in operation.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Regularly check and empty the wooden chest to prevent it from becoming full, which halts the mining process. Consider expanding storage capacity or improving the transfer rate to the furnace.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving a steady supply of iron ore by checking the inserter setup and maintaining adequate fuel levels in the inserter."}
