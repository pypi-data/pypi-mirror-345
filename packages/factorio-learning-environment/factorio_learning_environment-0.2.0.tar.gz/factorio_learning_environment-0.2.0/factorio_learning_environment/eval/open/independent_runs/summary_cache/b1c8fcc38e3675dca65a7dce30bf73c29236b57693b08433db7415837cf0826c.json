{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the provided execution logs.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Line (around position 41,-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Transport belt at position (41.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) facing DOWN\n- Stone furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) facing UP\n\nThe structure is set up to mine coal and transport it via belt system. Currently experiencing some flow issues with the belt being blocked.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target location is clear of other entities\n- When rebuilding/reconstructing systems, make sure to properly clear all existing entities from the target area first\n- Pay attention to entity sizes - some entities like burner mining drills and furnaces take up 2x2 tiles\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- When transport belts show \"blocked\" warnings, ensure there's proper flow and items can move through the system\n- Consider the direction of belts and inserters carefully when designing transport systems\n- Make sure inserter pickup and drop positions align with the intended source and destination points\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner entities to ensure continuous operation\n- Keep track of inventory space in destination entities to prevent blockages\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- `belt`: TransportBelt - Used for moving items\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter - Used for transferring items between entities\n- `entrance`: UndergroundBelt - Attempted but failed due to missing inventory item\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill - Used for resource extraction\n- `furnace`: Furnace - Used for smelting operations\n\nThe execution logs show multiple attempts at rebuilding and optimizing a coal processing line, with several iterations trying different configurations of belts and inserters. The system appears to be functional but experiencing some flow issues that need to be addressed."}
