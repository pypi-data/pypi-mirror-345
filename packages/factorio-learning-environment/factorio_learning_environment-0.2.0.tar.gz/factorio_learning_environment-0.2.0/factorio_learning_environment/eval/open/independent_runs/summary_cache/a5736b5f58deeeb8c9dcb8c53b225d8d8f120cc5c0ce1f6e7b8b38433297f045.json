Adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions to avoid collisions.\n\n\u2022 Belt Connection Errors  \n  \u2013 Validate alignment and connectivity when linking transport belts to inserters. Use the proper intermediary (inserter) when connecting to storage (chest) to maintain a valid connection path.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Entity Reference  \n  \u2013 Confirm that all entity variables are correctly assigned and defined before they are referenced in connection operations.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Availability Checks  \n  \u2013 Verify that required items (for example, burner-inserter) are present in the inventory prior to attempting placement to avoid missing item errors.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Management  \n  \u2013 Monitor and maintain fuel levels for automated entities like mining drills to prevent operation disruptions.\n\n\u2022 Harvesting Proximity Error  \n  \u2013 Move the agent within immediate reach of a resource patch before initiating harvesting commands.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Verification for Placement  \n  \u2013 Ensure the required entity is present in the inventory before placing it.\n\n\u2022 Ingredient Dependency for Composite Crafting  \n  \u2013 Confirm that all necessary sub-ingredients are available before crafting composite items.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range Error  \n  \u2013 Position the agent close enough to the target location to satisfy placement range requirements.\n\n\u2022 Output Sink Blockage  \n  \u2013 Arrange sink entities (such as chests) correctly within the drill\u2019s drop zone to prevent output blockage."}
