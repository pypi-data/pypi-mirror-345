{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) supplying coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting.\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Iron Chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storage.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), (-8.5, -49.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that the upstream supply of items is consistent and sufficient to keep the inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) operational. Check the supply lines and adjust production rates if necessary.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination storage (chests) has enough space to accommodate the items being moved by inserters. Regularly check and clear out full chests to prevent blockages.\n\n### Warnings of Full Chests\n- Regularly empty the chests at drop positions, such as (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5), to continue mining operations without interruption.\n\n### Furnace Belt Blockage\n- Ensure that the output belts from furnaces are clear and have space to accept new items. Regularly monitor and clear any blockages to maintain smooth production flow."}
