{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### First furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and producing iron plates.\n\n### Second furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Third furnace at position (4.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 4.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Fourth furnace at position (6.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 6.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (8.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 8.5, 0.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace. For example, errors occurred when trying to insert iron ore or coal without having them in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when the furnace inventory is full\n- Monitor the inventory of the furnace before inserting items. If the furnace is full, you will not be able to insert additional items. \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. \n\n### Errors when coal runs out\n- Regularly check the fuel status of your furnaces and ensure you have enough coal to keep them operational."}
