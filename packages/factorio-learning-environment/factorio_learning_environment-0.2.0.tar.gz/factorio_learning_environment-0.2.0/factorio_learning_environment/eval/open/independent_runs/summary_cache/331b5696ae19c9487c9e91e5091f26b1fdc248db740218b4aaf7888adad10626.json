Check the supply chain and inventory to ensure that items are available for transfer.\n\n### Full Output Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty the output slots of furnaces and chests to prevent production halts due to full inventories. This will ensure continuous production and avoid warnings related to full output.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt Warnings\n- Ensure that furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials to smelt. Monitor the input inventory of furnaces to avoid idle time and increase production efficiency."}
