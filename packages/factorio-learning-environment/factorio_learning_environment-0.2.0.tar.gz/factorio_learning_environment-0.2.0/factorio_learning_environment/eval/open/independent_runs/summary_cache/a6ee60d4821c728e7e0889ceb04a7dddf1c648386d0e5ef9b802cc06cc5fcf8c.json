Consider adjusting spacing, changing direction, or selecting a different reference position when placing entities.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Ensure all entities that require electricity are connected to a power source. Check the electricity network for any disconnected poles or insufficient power generation.\n\n### Errors due to missing resources\n- Ensure that all required resources for production are available. Check the inventory and supply lines to ensure continuous production.\n\n### Errors due to fuel shortages\n- Regularly check fuel levels in entities like boilers and mining drills to prevent operation halts. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to these entities."}
