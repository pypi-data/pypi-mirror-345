{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map during these steps. The agent repeatedly attempted to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) \u2013 a structure intended to receive Automation Science Packs for research \u2013 but none was crafted or placed because of API misusage and insufficient resources. Although the agent interacted with existing smelting facilities (an iron furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)) to process ores into plates, these were not built by the agent but merely used in resource processing. Overall, no additional structures appear on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Misuse\n  \u2013 When calling get_entities, avoid unsupported keyword arguments (for example, do not pass \u2018radius\u2019) and do not supply extra positional arguments. Verify the correct function signature before use.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Retrieval\n  \u2013 Confirm that a Lab exists in inventory before attempting its placement. Instead of directly iterating over a retrieved result (which may be None), check and default to an empty list if no entities are found.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting Dependency Shortages\n  \u2013 Ensure that all prerequisite resources and sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are sufficiently available before initiating Lab crafting. Address resource chain dependencies (e.g. smelting raw materials in an appropriate furnace) to meet required ingredient amounts and avoid repeated crafting errors."}
