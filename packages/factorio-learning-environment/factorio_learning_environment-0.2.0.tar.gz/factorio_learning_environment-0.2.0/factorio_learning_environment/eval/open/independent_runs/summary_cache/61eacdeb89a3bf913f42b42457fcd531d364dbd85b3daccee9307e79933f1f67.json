{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with a fuel inventory containing coal (3 units) and a result inventory containing copper plates (100 units). The furnace is currently inactive due to having no ingredients to smelt and its result inventory being full.\n\n### Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing copper plates (116 units).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when crafting items due to insufficient ingredients**: \n  - Ensure that the required ingredients for crafting are available in the inventory or can be produced by the structures present. In this case, copper plates are required for crafting the automation science pack, but the furnace is not producing any due to lack of ingredients.\n  \n- **Errors when transferring items to the chest**:\n  - Verify that there are items available in the inventory before attempting to transfer them to the chest. The logs indicate that there are no copper plates available in the player's inventory to transfer.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to the inability to craft the required copper plates. \n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary containing items in the player's inventory, type: `dict`\n  - `chest_inventory`: Dictionary containing items in the chest, type: `dict`\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Dictionary containing items in the furnace, type: `dict`"}
