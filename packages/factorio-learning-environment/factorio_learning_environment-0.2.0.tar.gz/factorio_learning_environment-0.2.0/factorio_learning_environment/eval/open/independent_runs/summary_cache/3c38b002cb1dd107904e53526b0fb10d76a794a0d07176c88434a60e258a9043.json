Consider emptying your inventory or using storage solutions like chests.\n- **Errors when using burner mining drill without fuel**: Always ensure that your burner mining drills have fuel before they are expected to operate. Check the fuel status and refill as necessary.\n- **Errors with inserters waiting for items**: If inserters are waiting for source items, ensure that the source (like a chest or a mining drill) has items available for extraction.\n- **Errors with inserters waiting for space in destination**: Make sure that the destination (like a chest) has space available for the items being inserted. Clear out items if necessary.\n- **Errors when trying to extract from a chest that is empty**: Ensure that the chest has items before attempting to extract. Check the chest's inventory status.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined**:\n  - `harvest_resource(position, quantity)`: Invoked but failed due to full inventory.\n  \n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `copper_harvested: int`\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory: dict`\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status: str`\n  - `burner_inserter_status: str`\n  - `stone_furnace_status: str`"}
