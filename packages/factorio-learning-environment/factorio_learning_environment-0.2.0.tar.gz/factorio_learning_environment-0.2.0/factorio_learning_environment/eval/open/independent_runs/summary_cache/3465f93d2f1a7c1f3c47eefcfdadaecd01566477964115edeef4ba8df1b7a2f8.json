{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-34.5, 35.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-28.5, 36.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-37.5, 38.5) (currently supplying water)\n- Boiler at position (-34.5, 35.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-34.5, 33.5)\n- Additional Steam Engine at position (-28.5, 25.5)\n- Additional Steam Engine at position (-46.5, 31.5)\n- Additional Steam Engine at position (-50.5, 31.5)\n- Additional Steam Engine at position (-48.5, 31.5)\n- Additional Steam Engine at position (-59.5, 31.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, producing copper plates\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (not specified), currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, some are empty or not successfully connected.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Supplying Steam\n- Check that the boiler has a sufficient supply of water and fuel. Ensure that the connections to the steam engine are not obstructed.\n\n### Errors when Placing Steam Engines\n- Avoid placing steam engines where the footprint overlaps with water or existing entities. Clear the area before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Entities\n- Ensure the entity you are attempting to pick up exists at the specified position. Verify the position before attempting to pick up the entity.\n\n### Errors with Lab Power\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source and that the power source is operational. Check the connections and the power network for any issues.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that you have the necessary pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. Verify the connection path and ensure it is clear of obstructions.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that the lab and other entities requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. Verify that the electricity generator is operational and supplying power.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the connection points between entities like boilers and steam engines are not blocked. Reposition entities if necessary to unblock connection points.\n\n### Errors when Removing and Repositioning Steam Engines\n- Before attempting to reposition a steam engine, ensure there is no existing entity at the target location. Clear the area to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Repeated Errors in Steam Engine Placement\n- Repeated attempts to place steam engines at positions where existing objects block placement indicate a need for better planning of layout. Consider clearing the area or choosing alternative locations before placement attempts.\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to both the boiler and the power network. Check for any obstructions or misalignments in the connection path.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Connection Points\n- When connecting boiler outputs to steam engines, ensure that the required connection points are not blocked by other entities. Adjust the layout to provide clear paths for connections.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Placement due to Existing Objects\n- Before placing a steam engine, ensure that the target location is clear of existing objects. Remove any obstructing entities to allow placement.\n\n### Offshore Pump Not Supplying Water\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is correctly positioned in water and connected to a boiler. Check for any blockages in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors with Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have crafted enough Small Electric Poles to connect the power network. Keep track of inventory to avoid running out of essential items.\n\n### Errors with Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have enough materials, such as wood and copper cables, to craft Small Electric Poles. Monitor your inventory and gather necessary resources in advance.\n\n### Errors with Copper Ore Insertion\n- Ensure you have copper ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a furnace. Regularly check your inventory to avoid running out of essential materials."}
