{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Verify the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of resources, as seen with the furnace not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Maintain sufficient coal inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Running out of coal can halt operations, as indicated by the error when trying to insert coal from an empty inventory."}
