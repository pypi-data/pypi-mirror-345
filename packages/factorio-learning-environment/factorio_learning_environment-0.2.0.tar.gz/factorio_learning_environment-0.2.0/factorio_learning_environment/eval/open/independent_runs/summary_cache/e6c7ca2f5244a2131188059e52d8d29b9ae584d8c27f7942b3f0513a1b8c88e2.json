{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new composite structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts to supply a Lab for research at position (0.5, 2.5) failed\u2014both its placement (due to a lack of lab inventory) and its crafting (due to insufficient sub-ingredients). In parallel, existing smelting facilities were utilized without any new construction:\n\u2022 Iron Smelting Facility \u2013 Retrieved at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for converting iron ore into iron plates.\n\u2022 Copper Smelting Facility \u2013 Retrieved at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for converting copper ore into copper plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Argument Errors for get_entities  \n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, use the correct signature. Remove unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and avoid supplying unexpected positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Validation  \n\u2003\u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab, verify that the required Lab item exists in inventory to avoid placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Safe Handling of Entity Retrieval  \n\u2003\u2013 When filtering retrieved entities (for example, labs), ensure that a None return value is converted to an empty iterable to prevent type errors.\n\n\u2022 Resource and Recipe Management in Lab Crafting  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (e.g. iron plates, iron-gear-wheels, copper-cables, and electronic circuits) are available before attempting Lab crafting. Prioritize completing necessary smelting processes and resource production so that recipe requirements can be fully met.\n\nNAMESPACE\n---------\n(No custom functions were defined by the agent.)"}
