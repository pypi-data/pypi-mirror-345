{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Electricity Generation Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 17.5) with no input liquid.\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 22.0) out of fuel.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) supplying water.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storage of resources like iron ore and coal.\n- Pipe Groups and Electricity Groups for fluid and power distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Retrieving Entities\n- Ensure the entity type and position are correct before attempting to retrieve an entity. For example, verify the presence of a burner inserter at the specified position before using `get_entity`.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Verify that all entities involved in a connection are correctly positioned and accessible. For instance, ensure that pipes are properly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check the inventory of connected chests and furnaces to ensure they contain the necessary items for processing.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that there is a steady supply of fuel such as coal to prevent downtime."}
