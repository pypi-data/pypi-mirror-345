{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) facing down, mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -48.5) moving items from drill to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) for smelting iron ore into plates\n\n### Unused Stone Furnaces\nTwo stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0) that were placed earlier but not actively being used in any production chain.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if the target position is already occupied by another entity before placing\n- When placing inserters next to other entities, ensure proper spacing and direction parameters to avoid collisions\n- Consider using place_entity_next_to() with appropriate spacing parameter to automatically handle positioning\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting to insert into entities\n- Keep track of fuel (coal) levels and ensure sufficient quantities before attempting to fuel entities\n\n### Errors with crafting recipes requiring machines\n- Some items like iron plates cannot be crafted directly and require smelting in a furnace\n- Ensure proper production chain is set up with appropriate machines before attempting to craft items requiring machine processing\n\n### Errors with entity dimensions and spacing\n- When calculating spacing between entities, access the actual width/height values rather than the ModelPrivateAttr objects\n- Use the entity prototype's WIDTH and HEIGHT properties correctly when determining placement positions"}
