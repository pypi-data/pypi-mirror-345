{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n\u2013 Burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) [direction: RIGHT]\n\u2013 Additional burner inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5)\n\u2013 Burner inserter with fuel (coal) at Position(x=1.5, y=17.5)\n\u2013 Assembling machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5)\n\nThis structure is set up to receive raw materials from the extraction system and process them into copper cable.\n\n### Belt Depot System at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Wooden chest placed at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) serving as an isolated belt depot\n\u2013 Transport belt segment adjacent at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5)\n\u2013 Depot burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) [direction: UP], whose pickup position is used as the final target for belt connections\n\nThis setup is intended to serve as an intermediary point for transferring items via the multi\u2010segment belt.\n\n### Extraction System at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n\u2013 Extraction system burner inserter at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5) with drop position at Position(x=-3.5, y=28.5)\n\nThis node is used as the source point for extraction operations connecting towards the production networks.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Steam engine at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)\n\u2013 Boiler at Position(x=-5.5, y=24.0)\n\u2013 Offshore pump at Position(x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n\nThis group forms the power production system, although connection attempts to it via transport belts have led to repeated errors.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2013 Belt Connection Errors:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Transport belts must be connected to an inserter rather than directly to a steam engine. Always verify that the target entity accepts item input before establishing a belt connection.\n  \n\u2013 Placement Distance Errors:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 When placing an entity (for example, a wooden chest), ensure the player is within the maximum placement range. Move closer if the target position is too far.\n  \n\u2013 Inventory Availability Errors:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Before attempting to place an object, confirm that the item is present in the inventory to avoid \u201cno \u2026 in inventory\u201d errors.\n  \n\u2013 Variable Reference Errors:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use the correct variable names when referencing entities (for example, ensure that depot_chest is used instead of undefined names like target_chest) to prevent NameError exceptions.\n\n"}
