{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5), boiler (position -24.5, -50.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not generating power due to being disconnected from the power network and lacking input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1.\n\n### Lab at position(-10.5, -10.5)\nCurrently connected to power from a small electric pole (position -10.5, -8.5). The lab was previously without power.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipes connecting the boiler and steam engine, with a fluid system providing steam. The pipe network includes various connection points and is currently experiencing issues connecting the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly placed and that the connection points are aligned. Check for any obstructions that may prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors related to lab power connection\n- Verify that the lab is connected to a functioning power source. If the lab is found to be without power, ensure that it is properly connected to the nearest electric pole.\n\n### Errors when checking fluid inputs\n- Confirm that the boiler has sufficient water supply. If the boiler is not generating steam, check the input fluid levels and ensure that the offshore pump is operational.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect attribute usage\n- Review the code for any incorrect references to attributes. Ensure that the attributes used are valid and exist within the prototype definitions.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities that may occupy the intended space."}
