{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, the error with `ore_furnace` suggests it was not defined. Verify variable names and ensure they are declared.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Check inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For instance, attempting to insert coal when none is available in inventory will cause an error.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that the output of entities like drills is not blocked by items on the ground. Place a chest or belt to collect output.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- Verify the existence of entities before attempting operations like extraction. Ensure that the target entity is present and contains the required resources.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect placement of entities\n- Double-check the placement logic for entities like Burner Inserters and Transport Belts to ensure they are placed in valid, unoccupied locations."}
