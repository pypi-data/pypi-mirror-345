{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nThe lab is designed for conducting research. \n- Currently, it is not receiving power, which is necessary for its operation.\n\n### Steam engine at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nThe steam engine is used to generate electricity. \n- It is connected to a boiler and requires a power connection to function properly.\n\n### Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nThe boiler is used to convert water into steam for the steam engine.\n- It is currently out of fuel and requires coal to operate.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\nThe offshore pump is used to draw water from a body of water for the boiler.\n- It is currently operational and connected to the water supply.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-18.5, 16.5)\nThis group of pipes is used to transport fluids between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n- It is essential for the fluid connections between these entities.\n\n### Electricity group at position(-16.5, 19.5)\nThis group consists of small electric poles that are intended to distribute electricity.\n- Currently, it is not effectively powering the steam engine and lab.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n-  Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n-  Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Ensure that all structures requiring power, such as the lab and steam engine, are properly connected to the power grid. Check the connections to small electric poles.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to fuel supply\n- Ensure that the boiler is adequately supplied with coal or other fuel sources to operate. Check inventory levels before attempting to use the boiler."}
