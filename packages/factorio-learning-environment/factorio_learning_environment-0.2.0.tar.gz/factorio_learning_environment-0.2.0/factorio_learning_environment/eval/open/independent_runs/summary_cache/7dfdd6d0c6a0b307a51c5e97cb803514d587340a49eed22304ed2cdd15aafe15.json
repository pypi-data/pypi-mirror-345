{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=41.5, y=-83.5), and (x=42.5, y=-83.5)\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chests\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5), (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), (x=8.5, y=0.5), and (x=11.5, y=0.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=2.5, y=0.5), (x=7.5, y=0.5), (x=10.5, y=1.5), and (x=12.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates and other materials\n- BeltGroup connecting the chests and furnaces\n\n### Coal Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=28.5, y=0.5), (x=30.5, y=0.5), (x=32.5, y=0.5), (x=34.5, y=0.5), (x=36.5, y=0.5), (x=38.5, y=0.5), and (x=40.5, y=0.5) for storing coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Non-callable Objects\n- Ensure that objects like 'Chest' are used correctly and not treated as callable functions.\n\n### NameError with Undefined Entities\n- Verify that all entities, such as 'BurnerInserter', are correctly defined and imported in the script. Double-check the spelling and case sensitivity of entity names.\n\n### ImportError with Incorrect Module Imports\n- Ensure that the correct entity names are being imported from the 'entities' module. Verify the module path and the names being imported.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function. Check the supply chain to ensure that items are being fed into the inserters.\n\n### Issues with Clearing Transport Belts\n- Confirm that the transport belt contains the expected items before attempting to clear or extract from it. Ensure that the belt is not empty or blocked.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Inspection\n- Make sure that the inventory of entities like transport belts is accessible and not nil before attempting to inspect or manipulate it."}
