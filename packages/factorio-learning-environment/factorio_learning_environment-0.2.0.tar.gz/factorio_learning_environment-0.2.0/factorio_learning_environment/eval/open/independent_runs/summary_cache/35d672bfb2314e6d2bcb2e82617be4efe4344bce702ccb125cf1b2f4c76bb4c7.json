The attempt at coordinate (65.0, -105.0) failed.\n- **Cannot place a Stone Furnace:** Check that the intended location is available and appropriate for a Stone Furnace. The placement attempt at (5.0, 5.0) was not successful.\n- **Cannot place a Burner Inserter:** Ensure the tile is clear and appropriate for placing a Burner Inserter. The attempt at (-50.0, 50.0) did not succeed.\n\nTo mitigate these errors, always check the target tile for obstructions or unsuitability before attempting to place an entity."}
