{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0).\n- The drill extracts coal and deposits it into the furnace for processing.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Collection Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Iron Ore is extracted and deposited into a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Collection Facility at Position (-39.5, -71.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-39.5, -71.5) intended to collect copper ore.\n\n### Copper Processing Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) intended for smelting copper ore.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Verify the coordinates and entity type.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. Regularly check inventory levels to prevent such errors.\n\n### Errors with chest positioning\n- Ensure that chests are correctly positioned to collect resources. Verify that the chests are placed within the drop zone of the mining drills.\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Regularly check fuel levels in mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel. Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel these entities as needed.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `get_entity(Prototype, Position)`: Attempts to retrieve an entity of a specified prototype at a given position. Failure occurs if no entity is found at the specified location.\n\n- **Variables:**\n  - `copper_drill`: Expected to be a BurnerMiningDrill, but retrieval failed due to non-existence at the specified position.\n  - `copper_furnace`: Expected to be a Furnace, but insertion failed due to insufficient coal in inventory.\n  - `iron_drill`: Expected to be a BurnerMiningDrill, but insertion failed due to insufficient coal in inventory."}
