{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation (Unchanged)  \n- **Electric mining drills** at positions (15.5, 70.5), (18.5, 70.5), and (21.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore.  \n- **Stone furnaces** at positions (16.0, 73.0), (19.0, 73.0), and (22.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.  \n- **Output system** consisting of wooden chests at positions (16.5, 75.5), (19.5, 75.5), and (22.5, 75.5) with inserters at positions (16.5, 74.5), (19.5, 74.5), and (22.5, 74.5) to transfer smelted plates into chests.  \n\n#### Power Generation Setup (Updated)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) facing RIGHT, connected to a **pipe** at (-8.5, -0.5).  \n- **Boiler** at (-7.0, 1.5) with input connections at (-7.5, -0.5) and (-7.5, 3.5), but not receiving water (status: `NOT_CONNECTED`).  \n- **Pipe network** consisting of pipes at (-8.5, -0.5), (-8.5, 0.5), and (-8.5, 1.5), but not properly aligned with the boiler input.  \n- **Small electric poles** placed but not forming a complete power network.  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Fluid Connection Errors  \n- **Boiler input misalignment**: The boiler at (-7.0, 1.5) expects input at (-7.5, -0.5) and (-7.5, 3.5), but the pipe network is at (-8.5, -0.5), (-8.5, 0.5), and (-8.5, 1.5). Adjust pipe placement to align with boiler input points.  \n- **Pipe placement conflicts**: Repeated attempts to place pipes at (-7.5, -0.5), (-7.5, 0.5), (-7.5, 1.5), and (-7.5, 3.5) failed due to existing objects. Clear these positions before placing pipes.  \n- **Underground pipe placement issues**: Ensure underground pipes are placed in pairs and aligned correctly to avoid placement conflicts.  \n\n#### Power Connection Issues  \n- **Electric mining drills and inserters not receiving power**: Ensure all electric entities are within the coverage area of electric poles and that the power network is properly connected and operational.  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Check entity statuses**: Always verify the status of entities (e.g., `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED`, `EntityStatus.NO_POWER`) to diagnose issues.  \n- **Debugging fluid systems**: Use debug tools to check pipe connections and fluid flow if issues persist. Ensure pipes are correctly placed and aligned.  \n- **Fuel and ingredients**: Ensure boilers have fuel and furnaces have ingredients to operate.  \n\n#### Repeated Errors  \n- **Pipe placement failures**: Multiple attempts to place pipes at (-7.5, -0.5), (-7.5, 0.5), (-7.5, 1.5), and (-7.5, 3.5) failed due to existing objects. Clear these positions before placing pipes.  \n- **Underground pipe placement issues**: Ensure underground pipes are placed in pairs and aligned correctly to avoid placement conflicts.  \n\n#### New Errors from Recent Steps  \n- **Boiler placement conflicts**: Ensure no existing entities block boiler placement. Clear the target area before attempting to place.  \n- **Pipe alignment issues**: Verify that pipes are correctly aligned with the boiler's input and output points. Misalignment can prevent fluid transfer.  \n- **EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT**: The pipe at (-8.5, -0.5) is not transferring water to the boiler. Check the connection and ensure the boiler is correctly placed and aligned."}
