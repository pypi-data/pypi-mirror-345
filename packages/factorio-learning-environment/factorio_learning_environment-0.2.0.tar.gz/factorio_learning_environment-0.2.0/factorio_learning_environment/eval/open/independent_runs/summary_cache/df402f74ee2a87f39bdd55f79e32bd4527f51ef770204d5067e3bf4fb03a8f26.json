{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Reposition and align inserters as needed to maintain proper flow.\n- Regularly refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and ceasing operation.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify the inserter setup to ensure the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting. Check the alignment and functionality of inserters.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel entities as needed. Avoid running out of essential resources by monitoring inventory levels regularly."}
