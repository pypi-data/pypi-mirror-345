The repeated failures at locations (-5.5, 23.0), (-6.5, 24.5), (-10.0, 20.0), (-9.0, 21.0) and (-8.0, 23.0) demonstrate the risks of targeting unbuildable areas.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the intended footprint is free from conflicts (e.g. water tiles or obstructions) to reduce unnecessary connection attempts.\n\n\u2022 BUILDABLE AREA CENTER EXTRACTION ERRORS:\n\u2003\u2013 When extracting the central candidate from a buildable area, access the center property correctly instead of invoking it as a function. This prevents TypeError issues caused by treating a Position object as callable.\n\n\u2022 CONNECTION FAILURES:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that valid, unobstructed connection points exist on both the source (Steam Engine) and target (Boiler) prior to initiating connection attempts. The failure to link a Steam Engine placed at (x=-14.5, y=15.5) to the Boiler at (x=-5.5, y=24.0) highlights the need for thorough pre-checks.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that neither endpoint is blocked and that connection types are compatible to minimize connection errors.\n\n\u2022 RESOURCE, POWER & FUEL DELIVERY:\n\u2003\u2013 Maintain a continuous supply of fuel for Furnaces and Boilers. Monitor inventory closely to avoid NO_FUEL conditions that interrupt thermal processing.\n\n\u2022 CRAFTING CHAIN & INVENTORY VERIFICATION:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all required crafted entities are available in inventory before attempting placement actions to reduce errors related to missing items.\n\n\u2022 UNDERGROUND PIPE & CONNECTION VALIDATION:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-check target tile availability and ensure source-target compatibility when establishing pipe-based connections to prevent obstructions.\n\n\u2022 MIXED CONNECTION ERRORS:\n\u2003\u2013 Reassess overlapping placements or incompatible connection types when connection failures occur. Adjust spacing, orientation, or connection strategy as needed to secure valid links."}
