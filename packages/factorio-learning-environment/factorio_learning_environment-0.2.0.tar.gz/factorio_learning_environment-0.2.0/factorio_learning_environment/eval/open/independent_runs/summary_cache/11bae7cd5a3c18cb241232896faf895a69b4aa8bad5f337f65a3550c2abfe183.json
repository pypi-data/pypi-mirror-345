{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with coal as fuel\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with coal as fuel\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and maintain the supply of ores to prevent idle furnaces.\n\n### Errors due to Output Blocked\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or a transport mechanism (e.g., belts) to accept the output from mining drills. This prevents blockage and ensures continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'stone-furnace', 'stone', 'iron-plate', and 'copper-plate'.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map with details such as position, fuel, and status."}
