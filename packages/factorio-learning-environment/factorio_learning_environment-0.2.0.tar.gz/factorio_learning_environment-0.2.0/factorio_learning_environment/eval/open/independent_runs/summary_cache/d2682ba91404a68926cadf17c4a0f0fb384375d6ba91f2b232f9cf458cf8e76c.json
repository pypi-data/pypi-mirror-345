{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple stone furnaces at positions (e.g., x=-14.0, y=-49.0 and x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with burner inserters (e.g., at x=-13.5, y=-47.5) feeding them.\n- Chests (e.g., wooden-chest at x=-13.5, y=-46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport belts connecting the furnaces to storage chests and other parts of the production line.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-10.5, y=25.5) intended to supply water.\n- Pipe groups (e.g., fluid system 32782) connecting the offshore pump to other parts of the network.\n- Electricity poles (e.g., at x=-9.5, y=-29.5) distributing power across the map.\n\n### Storage Area\nIncludes:\n- Multiple chests (e.g., wooden-chest at x=-9.5, y=-43.5 and x=-7.5, y=-43.5) used for storing iron plates and other materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are correctly aligned and that the target pipe positions are valid and accessible from the offshore pump.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Regularly check inventory space before harvesting resources to avoid full inventory errors.\n- Ensure storage chests have enough space before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Verify the availability of required resources before attempting to craft items to avoid crafting failures.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- When placing entities like boilers, ensure the placement location is valid and does not overlap with water or other obstacles.\n\n### Type Errors in Code\n- Review code for correct usage of methods and ensure that objects are being called correctly to avoid type errors."}
