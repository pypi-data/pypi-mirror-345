{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the ground. Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore. Currently contains 3 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently fueled with coal but is waiting for source items due to misalignment issues.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning indicates persistent alignment issues.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Maintain adequate fuel levels in the mining drill and inserter to ensure continuous operation. The mining drill is currently out of fuel, halting ore extraction.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Regularly empty the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which stops the mining drill from depositing more ore.\n\n### Furnace Input Management\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. The current setup is not delivering ore to the furnace, preventing production of iron plates.\n\n### Inventory Monitoring\n- Monitor inventory levels to ensure there is enough coal and other resources to keep operations running smoothly."}
