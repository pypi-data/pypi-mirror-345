{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully built on the map. All attempted placements of a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) have failed due to inventory shortages and unresolved crafting dependencies. Although processing facilities (furnaces) were accessed during smelting operations\u2014such as the furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron plate production and the copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production\u2014none of these were constructed by the agent as dedicated structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage \u2013 When calling get_entities(), use the correct parameters. The function does not accept a keyword like \u201cradius\u201d and must not be provided with extra positional arguments.\n\u2022 Safe Entity Handling \u2013 Always verify that the result from an entity retrieval call is a valid collection (or default to an empty list) before iterating over it to avoid \u201cNoneType\u201d iteration errors.\n\u2022 Lab Placement Verification \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab, confirm that the Lab is available in your inventory. Failing to do so leads to placement errors.\n\u2022 Crafting Chain Dependencies \u2013 Ensure that every sub-ingredient required for crafting a Lab (including iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) is available. Validate that each production step\u2014such as smelting or assembling intermediate components\u2014is functional and sufficiently resourced before initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2022 Resource Quantity Checks \u2013 Double-check that required ingredient counts (for example, additional iron-gear-wheels when shortages are reported) are met prior to crafting to prevent recipe failures."}
