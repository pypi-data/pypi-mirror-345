{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) - no fuel\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) with 4 coal and 20 iron plates\nSystem not operational due to lack of fuel in drill\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting System at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) - no fuel\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) with 2 coal and 14 copper plates\nSystem not operational due to lack of fuel in drill\n\n### Power Generation System at (-14.5, 19.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) - working and producing water\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) - operational with coal, water, and steam\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 16.5) - not properly connected\n- Water pipe system (ID 22525) connecting offshore pump to boiler\nSystem still not operational due to steam connection issues\n\n### Research Lab System\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs (10)\nCurrently not operational due to no power\n\n### Unused Smelting Area\nGroup of 4 unused furnaces at:\n- (0.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 4.0)\n- (4.0, 4.0)\nAll have fuel (23 coal each) but no ingredients\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nElectric pole network (Group ID 4320) connecting various areas but currently not operational (0 voltage)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Steam Engine Placement Issues\n- Steam engine must be placed in non-water tiles\n- Steam engine must be placed with proper alignment to boiler's steam output point (-14.5, 17.0)\n- Ensure target position is clear of other entities before placement\n- Steam engine footprint (3x5 tiles) must be considered when placing\n\n### Entity Placement Distance\n- Move closer to target location when placing entities\n- Maximum placement distance is 10 tiles from player position\n- Calculate distance before attempting placement to ensure it's within range\n\n### Connection Point Blockage\n- Ensure connection points between entities are not blocked by other structures\n- Verify steam and water connections have clear paths\n- Remove blocking entities before attempting to establish connections\n\n### Pipe System Management\n- Remove existing pipe groups before creating new connections\n- Create direct, minimal connections:\n  1. Water connection: Offshore pump to boiler\n  2. Steam connection: Boiler to steam engine\n- Avoid creating multiple disconnected pipe segments\n\n### Resource Management\n- Check and maintain coal levels in production entities\n- Clear processed materials from furnaces regularly\n- Current inventory shows excess of pipes (1900+) while lacking essential resources\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Complete one working power generation setup before expanding\n- Ensure both water and steam connections are properly established\n- Verify electrical connections once power generation is operational"}
