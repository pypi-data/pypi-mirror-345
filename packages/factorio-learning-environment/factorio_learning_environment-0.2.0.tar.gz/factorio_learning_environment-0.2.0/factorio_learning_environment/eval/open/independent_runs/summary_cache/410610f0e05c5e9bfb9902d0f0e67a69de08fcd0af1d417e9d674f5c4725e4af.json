{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 2.5) \n- Lab (position 3.5, 0.5) which is currently not powered\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 18) and producing iron plates\n- Furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 7) and currently has no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Storage chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) which is currently empty\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new poles\n- Ensure that the arguments passed to the `PlaceObject` function are correct. The first argument must be a Prototype object, and the second must be a Direction object. Double-check the values being passed to avoid multiple values for the same argument.\n\n### Errors when the lab is not powered\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Check the placement of electric poles and their connections to the lab.\n\n### Errors when insufficient ingredients for research\n- Make sure to gather enough automation science packs (10 required) to complete the Automation research. Regularly check inventory and production rates to maintain sufficient supplies."}
