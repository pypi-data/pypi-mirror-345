{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chest\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) transferring items from the chest to a transport belt\n- BeltGroup connecting the chest to further processing or storage\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, 0.5) for storing copper plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace to another wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) for storing additional copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the connected chests or furnaces have items available for the inserters to transfer. Check the inventory of source entities to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor and clear out chests that are full to prevent blockages in production. Consider using additional storage or automating the transfer of items to prevent overflow.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as burner mining drills and inserters, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check fuel levels and refuel as necessary to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items\n- Verify that the target entity contains the items you intend to extract. Ensure that the entity is not empty or depleted of the specific item type before attempting extraction."}
