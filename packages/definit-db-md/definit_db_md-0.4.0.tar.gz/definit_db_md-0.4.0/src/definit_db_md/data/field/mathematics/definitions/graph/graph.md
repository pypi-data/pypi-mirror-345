# graph

Graphs are used to model pairwise [relations](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/foundamental/relation.md) between objects. A graph is made up of [nodes](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/node.md) and [edges](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/edge.md). Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and can represent various types of [relationships](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/foundamental/relation.md) in different fields.
