{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (23.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain from raw iron ore to iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) transferring ore from the drill to the furnace\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) crafting iron gear wheels from iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) extracting iron gear wheels from the assembling machine\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels output\n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) providing electricity to the assembling machine and inserters\n\nThis structure is powered by burner inserters fueled with coal. The assembling machine currently lacks power from the electric pole, causing it to be non-operational.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory when placing entities\n- The agent attempted to place an assembling-machine-1 but did not have it in inventory. Always verify inventory contains the required entity before placement to avoid exceptions.\n- Similarly, placing a small electric pole failed due to no small electric poles remaining in inventory. Track inventory counts carefully before placement.\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts directly from furnaces\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a stone furnace as a source entity. Instead, use an inserter to extract items from the furnace and connect belts from the inserter.\n\n### Errors placing entities due to collisions or occupied tiles\n- Multiple attempts to place burner inserters next to the furnace failed due to existing entities (wooden chest, other inserters, assembling machine) occupying the target tiles.\n- To avoid this, increase spacing, change placement direction, or adjust reference positions to find free tiles for entity placement.\n\n### Errors due to assembler not receiving power\n- The assembling machine 2 is not powered because the electric pole is either missing or not connected properly.\n- Ensure electric poles are placed and connected to the assembling machine and inserters to provide electricity for operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent so far."}
