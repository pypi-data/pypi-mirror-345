{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to insert Copper Ore into the active furnace has once again failed:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace remains empty after the attempt to load **1 piece of Copper Ore**.\n- The status continues to show **\"WORKING\"**, but it has not accepted any materials for processing.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **1 piece of stone** available.\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** accumulated in inventory.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not recognizing the Copper Ore input, which suggests a potential issue with the furnace's configuration or the way materials are being loaded.\n- The furnace's behavior indicates it is unable to process any materials, even when they are available.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Recheck Furnace Configuration**: I need to ensure that the furnace is set up correctly to accept Copper Ore and that there are no restrictions preventing it from doing so.\n2. **Load Stone**: Since I have **1 piece of stone** available, I can try loading that into the furnace to see if it can process any material at all.\n3. **Monitor for Changes**: After attempting to load the stone, I will observe the furnace's behavior to determine if it begins any processing.\n\nLet's proceed by inserting the available stone into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the available stone into the active furnace to test its processing capability\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Insert the available piece of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_stone_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading stone: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading stone: {overall_inventory_after_stone_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-362]"}
