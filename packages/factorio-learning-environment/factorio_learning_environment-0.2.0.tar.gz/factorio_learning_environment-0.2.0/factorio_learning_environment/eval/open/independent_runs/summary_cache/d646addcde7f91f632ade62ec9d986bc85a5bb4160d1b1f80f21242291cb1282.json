{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with multiple pipes forming a network to transport water.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for coal storage\n- Additional Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) containing iron plates\n- Additional Iron Chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles forming a network, with a pole at position (x=9.5, y=39.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Steam Pipes\n- Ensure that all pipes are properly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes that may prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Verify that the steam engine is correctly connected to a source of steam. Ensure that the boiler is producing steam and that there are no gaps in the pipe network leading to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Power Network Connection\n- Make sure that the steam engine is connected to the power network with small electric poles. Ensure that the poles are within range and properly linked to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Full Chest Warnings\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to storage capacity issues. Consider expanding storage or automating the transfer of items to other storage solutions."}
