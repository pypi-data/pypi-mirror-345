{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully built on the map in this update. The agent made multiple attempts to establish a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but none succeeded because the Lab item was never available in the inventory and required ingredients could not be produced. Although existing furnaces were used for smelting (an iron furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0) for processing ores), these were pre\u2010existing facilities rather than new structures created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2013 Incorrect API Usage for Entity Retrieval:\n  \u2022 Use the proper function signature for get_entities. Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extraneous positional arguments.\n  \u2022 Check the return value of get_entities before iterating; if it can be None, substitute an empty list to avoid TypeErrors.\n  \n\u2013 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures:\n  \u2022 Verify that a Lab item exists in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n  \u2022 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available in sufficient quantities prior to crafting a Lab.\n  \u2022 Cross-check resource requirements and update inventory counts to prevent recurring crafting failures."}
