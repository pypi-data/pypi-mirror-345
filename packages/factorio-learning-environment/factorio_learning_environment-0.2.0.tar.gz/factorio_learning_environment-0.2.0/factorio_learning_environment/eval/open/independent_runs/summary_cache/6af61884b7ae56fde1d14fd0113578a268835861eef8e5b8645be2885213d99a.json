{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler (position not specified, assumed to be connected)\n- Steam engine (position not specified, assumed to be connected)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified, assumed to be connected)\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position (x=10.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position not specified, assumed to be connected)\n- Inserter (position not specified, assumed to be connected)\n- Beltgroup (position not specified, assumed to be connected)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that cannot accommodate the pole (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors when attempting to retrieve entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position. If you receive an error stating that no entity of that type is found, check the coordinates and the type of entity you are attempting to access.\n\n### Repeated Errors\n- The agent has repeatedly encountered issues with placing electric poles at coordinates (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0). Ensure to check for any persistent blocking entities in these areas before attempting to place poles again.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the map for any entities that may obstruct your construction plans.\n- Familiarize yourself with the terrain and the types of entities that can be placed in specific locations to avoid placement errors."}
