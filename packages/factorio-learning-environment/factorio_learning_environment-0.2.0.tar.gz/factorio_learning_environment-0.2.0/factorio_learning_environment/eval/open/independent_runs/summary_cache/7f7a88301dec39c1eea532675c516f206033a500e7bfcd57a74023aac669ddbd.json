For example, the burner-mining-drill requires iron-plate and iron-gear-wheel, which in turn requires iron-plate.\n  \n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**: \n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: \n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, quantity=1)`: Failed due to missing ingredients.\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=3)`: Failed due to missing ingredients.\n\n- **Variables**:\n  - `crafted_drill_count`: int\n  - `crafted_gear_wheels`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n  - `current_inventory`: dict"}
