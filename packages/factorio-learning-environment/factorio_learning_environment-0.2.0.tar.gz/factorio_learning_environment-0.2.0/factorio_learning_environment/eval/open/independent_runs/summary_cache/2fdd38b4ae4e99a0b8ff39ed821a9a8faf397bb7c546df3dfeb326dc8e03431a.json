{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), (20.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at an unspecified position with no power, requiring automation science packs.\n\n### Electricity Infrastructure\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, currently with no voltage.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups at various positions, all currently empty and not connected to any fluid source.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that there is a clear path for pipes between the offshore pump at position (-11.5, 26.5) and the boiler at position (-3.5, 26.0). Check for any obstructions and ensure pipes are placed correctly.\n\n### Errors in Using `pickup_entity` Function\n- When using `pickup_entity`, ensure that if the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None. If specifying a position, ensure it is a valid Position object.\n\n### Errors in Placing Pipes\n- Before placing pipes, check for obstacles at the intended positions. Ensure that the path is clear for pipe placement to avoid placement errors."}
