{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (5 units)\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, Stone Furnace\n  - Pickup Position: (-12.5, -48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (-14.5, -48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Positioning\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Verify the pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly set up for the intended transfer of items.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the inserter is fueled and operational, and that the chest contains sufficient iron ore.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chest\n- Regularly monitor and empty the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent it from becoming full and halting mining operations. Consider expanding storage capacity or processing materials more frequently to avoid bottlenecks.\n\n### General Inventory Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal for fueling entities like the burner mining drill, inserter, and furnace to ensure continuous operation. Regularly check and refuel as necessary."}
