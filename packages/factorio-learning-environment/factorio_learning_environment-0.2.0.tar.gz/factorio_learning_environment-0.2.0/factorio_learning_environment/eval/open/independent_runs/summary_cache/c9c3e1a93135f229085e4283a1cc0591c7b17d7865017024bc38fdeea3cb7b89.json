{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position(x=-26.0, y=-61.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position(x=-26.0, y=-61.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=-27.5, y=-62.5): Transfers items between the chest and furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=-28.5, y=-62.5): Stores coal for the furnace.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position(x=-28.0, y=-61.0): Mines iron ore, but currently out of fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=-27.5, y=-59.5): Stores mined iron ore and copper ore.\n\n#### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position(x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position(x=-28.0, y=-61.0): Mines copper ore, but currently out of fuel and the chest at drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=-27.5, y=-59.5): Stores mined copper ore.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position(x=2.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position(x=2.0, y=-63.0): Mines iron ore, but currently out of fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position(x=4.0, y=-63.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates, but currently has no ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=3.5, y=-61.5): Transfers items between the chest and furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=2.5, y=-61.5): Stores mined iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=4.5, y=-61.5): Stores iron ore for smelting.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a chest\n- Ensure the chest contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n- Verify the chest is accessible and not blocked by other entities.\n\n#### Errors due to out of fuel\n- Always ensure mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate.\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in burners and replenish as needed.\n\n#### Errors due to full chests\n- Empty chests at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue operating.\n- Ensure there is sufficient storage capacity for mined resources.\n\n#### Errors due to no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients before attempting to smelt.\n- Check the inventory of the furnace and replenish ingredients as needed.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **extract_item(Prototype.CopperOre, chest, quantity=10)**: Attempts to extract copper ore from a chest. Fails if the chest does not contain the item or is inaccessible.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **extracted_copper_ore**: Variable intended to store extracted copper ore. Type: `Item`.\n- **current_inventory**: Stores the current inventory of the agent. Type: `Dict[str, int]`."}
