{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Storage chests at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -52.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Inventory Management\n- Ensure storage chests have sufficient capacity before attempting to insert items. The agent attempted to insert iron plates into a full chest at position (-6.5, -50.5) and a new chest at position (-5.5, -52.5), resulting in failed insertions.\n\n### Errors when Extracting\n- Ensure that the entity from which you are trying to extract is not empty or has the required items. The agent encountered an error when attempting to extract without specifying the target entity.\n\n### Errors due to Resource Availability\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal to refuel burner mining drills and enough iron ore to insert into furnaces.
