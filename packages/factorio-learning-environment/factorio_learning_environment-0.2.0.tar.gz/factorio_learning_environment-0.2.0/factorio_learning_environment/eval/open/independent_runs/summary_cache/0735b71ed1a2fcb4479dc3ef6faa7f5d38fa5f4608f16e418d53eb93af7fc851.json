{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Boiler System at Position (-2.5, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 25.0), operational with coal as fuel.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5), providing water to the boiler.\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes at positions (-7.5, 24.5), (-6.5, 24.5), (-5.5, 24.5), (-4.5, 24.5), and (-4.5, 25.5).\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 21.5), currently empty, with pipes at positions (-12.5, 21.5), (-11.5, 21.5), (-11.5, 22.5), (-10.5, 22.5), (-10.5, 23.5), and (-9.5, 23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (-5.5, 25.5), (0.5, 24.5), (-7.5, 22.5), and others, providing power distribution.\n\n### Furnace System\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), with coal as fuel but currently not operational due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Finding and Placing Offshore Pumps\n- Ensure to correctly identify and move to a suitable water source location before attempting to place an offshore pump.\n- Verify that the target tile for the offshore pump is not obstructed by other entities or terrain features.\n\n### Errors in Boiler Placement\n- Confirm that the dimensions and position of the boiler are valid integers and that the target tile is clear for placement.\n- Ensure that the boiler is placed close enough to the offshore pump for effective connection via pipes.\n\n### Connection Errors Between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Verify that the pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler are correctly configured and that the PipeGroup object is used correctly.\n- Ensure that pipes are placed in a continuous line without gaps or incorrect orientations.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Maintain sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel boilers and other fuel-dependent structures.\n- Regularly check inventory levels to avoid running out of essential resources like coal.\n\n### General API Misuse\n- Avoid using string indices where integer indices are required in API calls.\n- Ensure that objects and attributes are correctly referenced and callable where necessary."}
