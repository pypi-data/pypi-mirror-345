{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Refueling Stations\n- **Burner Inserter at position (1.5, -0.5)**\n  - Refueled regularly with coal.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (3.5, -0.5)**\n  - Refueled regularly with coal.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (4.5, 1.5)**\n  - Refueled regularly with coal.\n\n### Belt Network\n- **Belt Group connecting various positions**\n  - Inputs and outputs at multiple positions, including:\n    - Belt from (5.5, 0.5) to (3.5, 0.5), direction: LEFT\n    - Belt from (2.5, 2.5) to (4.5, 2.5), direction: RIGHT\n  - Consists of several belts, facilitating item transport across the map.\n\n### Storage and Transfer Setup\n- **Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5)**\n  - Used for storing items, currently contains 0 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (6.0, 1.5)**\n  - Transfers items from belt to chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts\n- Ensure that the target position for belt placement is unoccupied and within reach. The repeated failure to connect belts from position (3.5, 1.5) to (5.5, 1.5) suggests a need to verify the availability of space and correct alignment.\n\n### Errors when handling entities not found\n- Double-check the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting operations. Errors were encountered when trying to handle a burner inserter at position (6.0, 1.5) and inspecting a wooden chest at position (6.5, 1.5). Ensure entities are placed correctly and exist at the intended coordinates.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly verify the map for stale or missing entities to prevent errors during operations.\n- Maintain a clear and organized layout to facilitate easy connection and management of structures, reducing the likelihood of placement errors."}
