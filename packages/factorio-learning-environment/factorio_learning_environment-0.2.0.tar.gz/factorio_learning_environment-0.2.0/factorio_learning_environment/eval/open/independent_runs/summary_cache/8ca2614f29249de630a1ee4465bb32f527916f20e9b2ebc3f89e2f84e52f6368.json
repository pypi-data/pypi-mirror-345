{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, currently working and producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from a chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore and transferring it to nearby chests.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, y=-48.5) and (-15.5, y=-48.5) receiving iron ore from the mining drill.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, y=-47.5) refueling various entities with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into full inventories\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. Regularly check and clear inventories to prevent overflow.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to refuel or insert items into entities. Regularly monitor and replenish your resource stock.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Make sure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to transfer. Check the production chain to ensure continuous flow of materials.\n\n### Inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to receive items from the inserter. Regularly clear or manage the output to maintain smooth operation."}
