Validate the current pipeline configuration and ensure the fluid_system ID used for connection matches a working PipeGroup.\n   - Update the method for tracking and selecting active fluid_system IDs to prevent redundant and unsuccessful attempts.\n\n\u2022 Pipeline Stabilization Strategy:\n   - Relying on a fixed 10-second delay for pipeline stabilization has not resolved connection issues. Incorporate dynamic checks that monitor real-time pipeline readiness before attempting subsequent connections."}
