{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Pole at position (-0.5, 19.5)\n- Electricity group at position (-5.4, 20.0) (not yet connected to the electric network)\n\n### Stone Furnace Setup\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) (currently lacking ingredients)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for clear paths and avoid obstacles.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that the boiler is supplied with fuel (e.g., coal) to function properly.\n\n### Errors in Electric Network Connection\n- Ensure that electric poles are connected to the electricity network and placed within range of each other to distribute power effectively.\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Ensure that required items (e.g., small electric poles) are available in the inventory before attempting to place them. Craft or gather necessary items if they are not available."}
