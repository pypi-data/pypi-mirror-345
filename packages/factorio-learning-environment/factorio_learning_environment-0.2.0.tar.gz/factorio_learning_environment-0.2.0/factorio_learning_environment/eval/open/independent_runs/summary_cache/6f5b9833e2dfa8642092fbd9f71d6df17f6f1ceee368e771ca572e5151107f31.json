{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Additional Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-16.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore.\n\n### New Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Stone Furnace\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing a Stone Furnace is unoccupied and that you have the furnace in your inventory before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Make sure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, ensure you have iron ore available before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors during expansion of smelting capacity\n- Verify that you have enough Stone Furnaces in your inventory before attempting to expand your smelting capacity. If not, craft additional furnaces as needed.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
