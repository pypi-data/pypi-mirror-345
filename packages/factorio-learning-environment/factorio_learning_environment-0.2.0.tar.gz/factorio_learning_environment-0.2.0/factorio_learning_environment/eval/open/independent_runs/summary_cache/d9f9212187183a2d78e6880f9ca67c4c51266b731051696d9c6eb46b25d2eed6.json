{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore and dropping into:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) is operational with iron ore being inserted regularly.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) is operational with iron ore being inserted regularly.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) is currently not operational due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of multiple **Wooden Chests** for storing various items:\n- Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) are available for storage purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Overflow Management\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent overflow and halt of mining operations. The chest is currently full, which stops the burner mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Management\n- Ensure that all furnaces have a consistent supply of iron ore to maintain continuous operation. The furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) is not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
