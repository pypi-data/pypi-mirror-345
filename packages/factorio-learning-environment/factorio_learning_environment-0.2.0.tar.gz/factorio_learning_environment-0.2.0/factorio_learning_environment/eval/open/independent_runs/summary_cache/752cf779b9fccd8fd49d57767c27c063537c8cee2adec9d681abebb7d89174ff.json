Check if the path is clear for pipe placement.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Electricity Poles\n- Verify that the electricity poles are correctly aligned and not overlapping with other entities. Ensure the connection path is clear and poles are within range.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and receiving steam. Check for any blockages or disconnections in the fluid system. Ensure the boiler is fueled and operational."}
