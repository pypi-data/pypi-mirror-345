{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (8.5, 31.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (0.5, 30.5)\n- Connected pipes at positions (8.5, 37.5), (9.5, 37.5), and (10.5, 37.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (10.5, 31.5) and (12.5, 34.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Connected pipes forming PipeGroups with various positions, including (-7.5, 24.5), (-6.5, 24.5), (-6.5, 25.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity before attempting to extract items. The maximum distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Check the target tile for existing entities before placing a new entity to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine Connection\n- Verify the connection path between the boiler and steam engine is clear and correctly configured with pipes. Ensure there are no obstructions and that all necessary pipes are in place.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement Due to Terrain or Obstructions\n- Before placing entities like boilers, ensure the target location is free from obstructions and is suitable for placement, avoiding water or other terrain issues.\n\n### Errors in Picking Up Entities\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure the second argument is a valid Position object to avoid ValueErrors."}
