{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-11.5, 18.5)\n- Boiler at position(-11.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipe groups that facilitate water flow from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(5, 5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n- Assembling machine at position(5, 5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position(5, 5) to the assembling machine at position(5, 5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Check the connections and ensure that the boiler is functioning properly to supply power.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Verify that the positions of the entities you are trying to connect are valid and that there are no obstacles preventing the connection. Ensure that the pipes are placed correctly to facilitate fluid flow.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
