This will prevent errors such as \"Failed to insert coal into stone-furnace... Inventory is full.\"\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will avoid errors like \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Common failure modes include attempting to insert when the target inventory is full or when the item is not present in the player's inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **furnace**: Represents the furnace entity being interacted with during item insertion operations.\n- **Prototype.Coal**: Represents the coal item type used in refueling and insertion operations."}
