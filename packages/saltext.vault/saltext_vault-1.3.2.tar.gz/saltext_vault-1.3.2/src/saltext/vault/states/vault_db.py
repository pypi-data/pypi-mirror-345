    Ensure a database connection is present as specified.

    name
        The name of the database connection.

    plugin
        The name of the database plugin. Known plugins to this module are:
        ``cassandra``, ``couchbase``, ``elasticsearch``, ``influxdb``, ``hanadb``, ``mongodb``,
        ``mongodb_atlas``, ``mssql``, ``mysql``, ``oracle``, ``postgresql``, ``redis``,
        ``redis_elasticache``, ``redshift``, ``snowflake``.
        If you pass an unknown plugin, make sure its Vault-internal name can be formatted
        as ``{plugin}-database-plugin`` and to pass all required parameters as kwargs.

    version
        Specifies the semantic version of the plugin to use for this connection.

    verify
        Verify the connection during initial configuration. Defaults to True.

    allowed_roles
        List of the roles allowed to use this connection. ``["*"]`` means any role
        can use this connection. Defaults to empty (no role can use it).

    root_rotation_statements
        Specifies the database statements to be executed to rotate the root user's credentials.
        See the plugin's API page for more information on support and formatting for this parameter.

    password_policy
        The name of the password policy to use when generating passwords for this database.
        If not specified, this will use a default policy defined as:
        20 characters with at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, and 1 dash character.

    rotate
        Rotate the root credentials after plugin setup. Defaults to True.

    force
        When the plugin changes, this state fails to protect from accidental errors.
        Set force to True to delete existing connections with the same name and a
        different plugin type. Defaults to False.

    mount
        The mount path the database backend is mounted to. Defaults to ``database``.

    kwargs
        Different plugins require different parameters. You need to make sure that you pass them
        as supplemental keyword arguments. For known plugins, the required arguments will
        be checked.

    Supports ``mod_beacon``.

    .. note::

        This function is mostly intended to associate a specific credential with
        a beacon that warns about expiry and allows to run an associated state to
        reconfigure an application with new credentials.
        See the :py:mod:`vault_lease beacon module <saltext.vault.beacons.vault_lease>`
        for an :ref:`example state to configure a lease together with a beacon <beacon-state-example>`.

    name
        The name of the database role.

    static
        Whether this role is static. Defaults to False.

    cache
        A variable cache suffix to be able to use multiple distinct credentials
        using the same role on the same minion.
        Ignored when ``static`` is true.

        .. note::

            This uses the same cache backend as the Vault integration, so make
            sure you configure a persistent backend like ``disk`` if you expect
            the credentials to survive a single run.

    valid_for
        Ensure the credentials are valid for at least this amount of time,
        otherwise request new ones.
        This can be an integer, which will be interpreted as seconds, or a time string
        using the same format as Vault does:
        Suffix ``s`` for seconds, ``m`` for minuts, ``h`` for hours, ``d`` for days.
        Defaults to ``0``.

    renew_increment
        When using cache and ``valid_for`` results in a renewal attempt, request this
        amount of time extension on the lease. This will be cached together with the
        lease and might be used by other modules later.

    revoke_delay
        When using cache and ``valid_for`` results in a revocation, set the lease
        validity to this value to allow a short amount of delay between the issuance
        of the new lease and the revocation of the old one. Defaults to ``60``.
        This will be cached together with the lease and might be used by other
        modules later.

    meta
        When using cache, this value will be cached together with the lease. It will
        be emitted by the ``vault_lease`` beacon module whenever a lease is
        running out (usually because it cannot be extended further). It is intended
        to support the reactor in deciding what needs to be done in order
        to to reconfigure dependent, Vault-unaware software with newly issued
        credentials. Entirely optional.

    mount
        The mount path the database backend is mounted to. Defaults to ``database``.
