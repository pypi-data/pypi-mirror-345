{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Copper Plate Production at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0).\n- The Burner Mining Drill extracts coal and feeds it into the Stone Furnace for smelting.\n\n#### Iron Plate Production at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- The Burner Mining Drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into the Wooden Chest.\n\n#### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) used for smelting copper ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or drills. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n#### Errors due to Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of your Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces. Ensure they are refueled promptly to avoid the \"out of fuel\" warning.\n\n#### Errors due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Verify that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. This will prevent the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int) -> Entity`: Function to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure that the inventory has the required quantity to avoid insertion errors.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity where items are being inserted.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity where items are being inserted.\n- `copper_mining_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity where fuel is being inserted.\n- `iron_mining_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity where fuel is being inserted."}
