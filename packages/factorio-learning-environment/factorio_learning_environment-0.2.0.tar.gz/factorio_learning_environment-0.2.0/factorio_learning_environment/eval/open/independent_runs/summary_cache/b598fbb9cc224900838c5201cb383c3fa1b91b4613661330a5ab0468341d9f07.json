{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace 1 at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with a burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) supplying coal and iron ore.\n- Furnace 2 at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with a burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) supplying coal and iron ore.\n- Iron chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Transport belts connecting the furnaces to the chest, facilitating the movement of iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, y=23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of:\n- A series of transport belts facilitating the movement of items between various entities, including a belt group connecting positions (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to their destination. The inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) is blocked due to a lack of space in the destination. Consider adjusting the layout or adding additional storage capacity to prevent blockages.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Always verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. An error occurred when trying to insert iron ore into Furnace 2 without having the required amount in the inventory.\n\n### Efficient Use of Resources\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of your entities to ensure they are operating efficiently. Keep a steady supply of coal to the furnaces and boiler to maintain production and power generation."}
