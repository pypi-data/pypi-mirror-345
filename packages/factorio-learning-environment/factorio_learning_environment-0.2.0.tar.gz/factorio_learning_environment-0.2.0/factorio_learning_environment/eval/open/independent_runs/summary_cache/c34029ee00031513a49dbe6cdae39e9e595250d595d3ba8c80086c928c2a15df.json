{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-6.0, 1.5) (contains 2 coal)\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 4.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Connected with pipes at (-8.5, -0.5), (-6.5, -0.5), (-7.5, -0.5)\n\n### Iron Production Facility at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore (status: NO_POWER)\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 72.5) containing 39 iron ore\n- Inserter at (16.5, 72.5) (status: NO_POWER)\n- Stone furnace at (18.0, 73.0) (status: WORKING, contains 37 coal, producing iron plates)\n- Assembling machine 2 at (20.5, 73.5) set to produce iron gear wheels (status: NO_POWER)\n- Small electric poles throughout the area (voltage: 0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent power connection issues\n- Steam engine remains unconnected despite power backbone creation (verify pipe connections)\n- Multiple entities (mining drill, inserter, assembler) still show NO_POWER status\n- When placing power poles, ensure they form a continuous network connecting all devices\n\n### Entity placement distance errors (recurring)\n- Must move within 10 tiles of target position before placing entities (occurred 4 times total)\n- Verify player position before attempting to place distant entities\n\n### Inserter placement and operation issues\n- Output inserter placement failed due to blocked position (clear area first)\n- Inserter rotation doesn't resolve NO_POWER status (fix power connection first)\n- Ensure inserter pickup/drop positions align with source/destination inventories\n\n### List attribute access errors\n- When working with lists of entities, access individual elements before using position attributes\n- Verify object types before attempting connection operations\n\n### Power pole placement conflicts\n- Attempted to place power pole where one already exists (remove existing pole first)\n- When rebuilding power networks, first scan area for existing poles\n\n### Assembler input issues\n- Assembler cannot produce gears due to missing iron plates (connect furnace output)\n- Verify assembler has both power and input materials before production checks\n\n### Fluid system warnings\n- Steam engine shows \"no input liquid\" warning (verify pipe connections from boiler)\n- Check fluid box connections between boiler and steam engine"}
