{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a status of WORKING. It is fueled by coal and processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) with a status of WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION. It is fueled by coal and is connected to a transport belt system.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) with a status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS. It is fueled by coal and is responsible for moving items from the mining drill to the transport belt.\n- Transport Belt at positions (43.5, -82.5), (43.5, -81.5), (43.5, -80.5), and (43.5, -79.5) forming a belt group that moves mined resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage. Consider connecting the mining drill to a storage chest or another processing entity.\n\n### Errors Related to Inserter Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entity has available items for the inserter to pick up. Check that the mining drill is producing items and that the transport belt is not obstructed.\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chest\n- Regularly check and clear the contents of storage entities to prevent them from becoming full and blocking further item insertion. Consider expanding storage capacity or increasing the rate of item processing."}
