{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Inserter Production Line at position(23.5, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position 23.5, 2.5) for crafting inserters\n- Input burner inserter (position 21.5, 2.5) \n- Output burner inserter (position 25.5, 2.5)\n- Input wooden chest (position 20.5, 2.5) containing 229 inserters and 1 iron plate\n- Output wooden chest (position 26.5, 2.5)\n\n###Iron Smelting Area\nMultiple furnaces for smelting iron:\n- Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position(2.0, 0.0) \n- Furnace at position(4.0, 4.0) with 5 coal fuel\n- Furnace at position(6.0, 4.0)\n\n###Power Generation System\nSteam power setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler (position -2.5, 24.0) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine (position 4.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Connected pipe networks for water (fluid system 34803) and steam (fluid system 34804)\n- Electric pole network (ID 116652) distributing power\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with crafting recipes requiring machines\n- When crafting items like electronic circuits that require assembling machines or furnaces, ensure you have the proper production setup rather than trying to hand-craft\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Monitor boiler fuel levels consistently\n- Keep coal readily available in inventory before attempting to refuel boilers\n- Add fuel before boiler completely runs out to maintain steady power generation\n\n### Errors with assembler ingredient shortages\n- Ensure all required ingredients (iron plate, iron gear wheel, electronic circuit) are available before starting assembly\n- Maintain proper supply chains for all components\n- Monitor assembler warnings for missing resources\n\n### Power system errors\n- Keep power system properly connected and fueled to avoid \"no power\" warnings\n- Maintain steam and water flow through proper pipe connections\n- Monitor boiler-steam engine connections\n\n### Resource management\n- Keep track of inventory levels for critical materials\n- Ensure proper resource flow between storage, furnaces and assemblers\n- Maintain adequate coal supply for both power and inserter operation"}
