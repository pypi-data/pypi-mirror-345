{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) connected to a series of Transport Belts (positions ranging from x=-26.5, y=-65.5 to x=-22.5, y=-65.5) for transporting copper ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transport System at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, producing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) for moving items from the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using `connect_entities` function\n- Ensure that both `start_position` and `end_position` are valid and not `None` before attempting to connect entities with `connect_entities`. This will prevent `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` objects.\n\n### Errors reconnecting belts\n- Verify that all belt segments are correctly positioned and not returning `None` before attempting to reconnect them. This will prevent errors related to `NoneType` objects lacking attributes like `tile_dimensions`."}
