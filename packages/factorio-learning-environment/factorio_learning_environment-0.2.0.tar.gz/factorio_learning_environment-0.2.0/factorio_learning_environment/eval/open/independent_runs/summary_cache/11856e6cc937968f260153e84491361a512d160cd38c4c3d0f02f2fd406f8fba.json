Inventory Management Issues\n   - Clear inventory space before attempting to pick up items\n   - Monitor inventory capacity and store excess materials in chests\n\n2. Resource Extraction Problems\n   - Ensure proper positioning when attempting to extract from chests\n   - Try different positions around storage structures if extraction fails\n\n3. Fuel Management\n   - Keep mining drills and inserters fueled to prevent work stoppage\n   - Monitor fuel levels in boilers to maintain power generation\n\n4. Machine Operation\n   - Ensure all required ingredients are available before starting assembly operations\n   - Keep proper fuel supplies for burner-type equipment\n\nNAMESPACE\nFunctions:\n- None defined in this log section\n\nImportant Variables:\n- coal_chest_position: Position (x=43.5, y=-82.5)\n- coal_drill_position: Position (x=43.0, y=-84.0)\n- coal_drill_drop_position: Position (x=43.5, y=-82.5)"}
