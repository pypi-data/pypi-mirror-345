The function takes 3 positional arguments: the two entities to connect and the type of connection.\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities are integers, not floats.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the tile where the entity is being placed is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions defined by the agent are available for analysis. \n\nImportant variables:\n* offshore_pump: type - Entity\n* boiler: type - Entity\n* Prototype.Pipe: type - Prototype\n* connect_entities: type - function"}
