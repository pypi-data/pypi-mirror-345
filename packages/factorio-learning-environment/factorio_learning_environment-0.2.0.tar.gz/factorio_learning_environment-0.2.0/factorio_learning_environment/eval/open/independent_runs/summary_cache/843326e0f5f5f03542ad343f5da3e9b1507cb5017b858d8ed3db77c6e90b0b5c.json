{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Location:** Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n- **Components:**\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) containing coal.\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a warning about the full chest at the drop position.\n  - Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n#### Iron Processing Facility\n- **Location:** Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- **Components:**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a warning about no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace and a wooden chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n\n#### Copper Processing Facility\n- **Location:** Position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\n- **Components:**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with a warning about no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace and a wooden chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5).\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5).\n\n#### Transport and Inserter System\n- **Location:** Positions along the x-axis from (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=11.5, y=0.5)\n- **Components:**\n  - Burner Inserters at positions (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), and (x=8.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n  - BeltGroup connecting various components along the x-axis.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors Related to Missing Entities\n- Ensure entities exist at the specified positions before attempting operations like extraction or insertion. Double-check coordinates and ensure entities are properly placed.\n\n#### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Regularly check the supply chain to ensure that source items are available for inserters. Refill or adjust the production line to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n#### Errors with Attribute and Name Definitions\n- Verify that all attributes and names are correctly defined and accessible in the code. Use correct references and ensure that necessary modules or dictionaries are imported and initialized.\n\n#### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly empty chests to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full storage. Implement automated systems to manage inventory levels efficiently."}
