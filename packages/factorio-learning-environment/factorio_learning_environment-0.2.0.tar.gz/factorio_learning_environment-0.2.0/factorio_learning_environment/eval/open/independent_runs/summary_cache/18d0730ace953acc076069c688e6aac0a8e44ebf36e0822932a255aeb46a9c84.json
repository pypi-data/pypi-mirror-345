{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line\nA large smelting facility for processing iron ore into plates, consisting of:\n\n1. Input System (Coal Storage)\n- 4 wooden chests at y=-2.5 positioned at x=0.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5\n- Each chest contains coal (18-38 units per chest)\n\n2. Smelting Array\n- 4 stone furnaces positioned at:\n  * (0.0, 0.0) - Contains 32 coal and 21 iron plates\n  * (2.0, 0.0) - Contains 32 coal and 52 iron plates\n  * (4.0, 0.0) - Contains 34 coal and 51 iron plates\n  * (6.0, 0.0) - Contains 34 coal and 52 iron plates\n\n3. Input Inserter System\n- 4 burner inserters at y=-1.5 positioned at x=0.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5\n- Each inserter moves materials from input chests to furnaces\n- All inserters are fueled with 19 coal each\n\n4. Output Collection System\n- 4 burner inserters at y=1.5 positioned at x=0.5, 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5\n- 3 wooden chests at y=1.5 positioned at x=2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 for collecting processed iron plates\n- All output inserters are fueled with 19 coal each\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing new entities, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- Example: Failed to place burner-inserter at (2.5, 1.5) due to existing entity\n\n### System Design Considerations\n- When designing smelting lines, ensure proper spacing between components to allow for inserter placement\n- Plan the layout to accommodate both input and output inserters without conflicts\n\n### Resource Management\n- The furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Ensure proper supply of raw materials (iron ore in this case) is maintained\n- Consider implementing a more robust input delivery system"}
