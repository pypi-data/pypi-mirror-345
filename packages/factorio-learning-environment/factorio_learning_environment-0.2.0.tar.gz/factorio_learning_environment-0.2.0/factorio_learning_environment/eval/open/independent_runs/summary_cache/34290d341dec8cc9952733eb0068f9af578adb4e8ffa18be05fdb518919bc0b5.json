{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with an inventory containing 100 copper plates and coal as fuel. The furnace is currently not able to smelt due to having no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when attempting to craft automation science packs:\n  - Ensure that you have the required ingredients (copper plates) available in your inventory or accessible from a furnace before attempting to craft items. The recipe requires a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace.\n  \n- Errors when transferring items to the chest:\n  - Confirm that there are copper plates available in your inventory before attempting to transfer them. If your inventory is empty, the transfer will fail.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined:**\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to the absence of required ingredients (copper plates) in the inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `copper_plates: int` - Current copper plates in inventory (0).\n  - `chest_inventory: dict` - Inventory of the chest containing {'copper-plate': 116}.\n  - `furnace_inventory: dict` - Inventory of the furnace containing {'copper-plate': 100}."}
