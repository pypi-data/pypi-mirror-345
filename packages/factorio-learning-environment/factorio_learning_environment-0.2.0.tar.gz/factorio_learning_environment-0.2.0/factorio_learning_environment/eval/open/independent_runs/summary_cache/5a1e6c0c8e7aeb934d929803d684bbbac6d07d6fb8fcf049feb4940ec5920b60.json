{"content": "# REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line 1 (at y=0.0)\nConsists of an automated smelting setup:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) connected to first furnace\n- Burner inserter at (2.5, 1.5) connected to second furnace\n- Wooden chest at (0.5, 2.5) collecting from first inserter\n- Wooden chest at (2.5, 2.5) collecting from second inserter\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line 2 (at y=4.0)\nConsists of an automated smelting setup:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n- Burner inserter at (4.5, 5.5) connected to first furnace\n- Burner inserter at (6.5, 5.5) connected to second furnace\n- Wooden chest at (4.5, 6.5) collecting from first inserter\n- Wooden chest at (6.5, 6.5) collecting from second inserter\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces, ensure proper spacing parameter to avoid collision with existing entities\n- Example: Failed to place burner inserter at x=1.5 y=0.0 due to existing furnace\n\n### Errors related to missing materials in inventory\n- Verify required materials are in inventory before:\n  - Placing structures (failed to place stone furnace due to no furnaces in inventory)\n  - Inserting fuel/materials (failed to insert coal due to empty inventory)\n  - Crafting items (failed to craft wooden chests due to missing wood)\n\n### Errors related to crafting limitations\n- Some items like iron plates cannot be crafted directly and require smelting in furnaces\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered, they cannot be crafted\n\n### Resource management tips\n- Maintain adequate coal supplies for both furnaces and inserters\n- Keep track of iron ore supplies to keep furnaces running continuously\n- Gather raw resources (wood, coal, iron ore) before attempting to craft or build structures that require them"}
