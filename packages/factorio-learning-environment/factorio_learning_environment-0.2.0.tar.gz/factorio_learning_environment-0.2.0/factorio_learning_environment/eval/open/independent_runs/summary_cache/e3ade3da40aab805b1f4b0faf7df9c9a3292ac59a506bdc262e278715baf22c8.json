{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron plate output.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron plate output.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron plate output.\n- **Iron Ore Storage**:\n  - Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Iron Plate Storage**:\n  - Multiple Wooden Chests at positions ranging from (-14.5, -50.5) to (-7.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it at position (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Ore Storage**:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items due to full storage\n- Ensure that the storage chest at the drop position is not full before continuing mining operations. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to allow the mining drill to continue working.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure that the target entity from which you want to extract items has the required items available for extraction. The extraction failed due to the unavailability of items in the specified quantity.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item(Prototype, entity, quantity)`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from an entity. \n  - **Failure Mode**: Extraction fails if the specified quantity of the item is not available in the entity's inventory.\n  \n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_iron_ore`: Stores the quantity of iron ore extracted from a chest.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory with items like 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
