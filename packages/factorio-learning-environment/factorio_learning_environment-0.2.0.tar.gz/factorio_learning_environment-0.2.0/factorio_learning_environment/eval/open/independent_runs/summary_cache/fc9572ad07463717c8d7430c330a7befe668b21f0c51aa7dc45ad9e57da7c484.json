{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Production Line\nMultiple furnace setups for smelting iron ore into plates:\n- Furnace with mining drill at x=-14.0 y=-47.0 connected to wooden chest\n- Furnace at x=0.0 y=0.0\n- Furnace at x=2.0 y=0.0  \n- Furnace at x=4.0 y=4.0\n- Furnace at x=6.0 y=4.0\n\n###Automation Science Pack Assembly\nLocated around x=24.5 y=4.5, consists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 \n- Input wooden chest at x=21.5 y=4.5 with burner inserter\n- Output wooden chest at x=27.5 y=4.5 with burner inserter\n- Multiple electric poles providing power\n\n###Power Generation System (Not Fully Connected)\nComponents:\n- Offshore pump at x=-9.5 y=24.5\n- Boiler at x=-2.0 y=23.5\n- Steam engine at x=9.5 y=19.5\n- Multiple pipe groups attempting to connect components but not fully functional\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Pipe Connection Errors\n- When connecting entities with pipes, ensure there is a clear unobstructed path between them\n- Remove any blocking entities before attempting to place pipes\n- Plan the pipe layout carefully to avoid placement conflicts with existing structures\n\n###Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing objects before placing new entities\n- Cannot place entities where another entity already exists\n- Use exact positioning when precision placement is required\n\n###Resource/Inventory Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to use/place them\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner devices to prevent them running out\n- Monitor input/output inventories to prevent blockages\n\n###Power Network Issues\n- Ensure all electrical components are properly connected via power poles\n- Steam engines require proper pipe connections for water and steam flow\n- Boilers need continuous fuel supply to maintain power generation"}
