{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at Position(40.0, -82.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Transport belt line from (39.5, -83.5) to (39.5, -86.5)\n- Self-fueling burner inserter at (41.5, -83.5)\nSystem is automated and self-sustaining with coal output moving down belt line\n\n### Iron Smelting Complex around Position(46.0, -80.0)\nTwo parallel smelting lines consisting of:\n1. First line:\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -80.0)\n- Input chest at (45.5, -77.5)\n- Output chest at (45.5, -82.5)\n- Burner inserters at (45.5, -78.5) and (45.5, -81.5)\n\n2. Second line:\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -80.0)\n- Input chest at (47.5, -77.5)\n- Output chest at (47.5, -82.5)\n- Burner inserters at (47.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -81.5)\n\n### Storage Area\n- Coal storage chest at (49.5, -80.5)\n- Mixed storage chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Additional storage chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Inventory Management Issues\n- Clear inventory space before attempting to craft or pick up items\n- Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow (multiple chests showing \"chest is full\" warnings)\n\n2. Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing inserters or other entities\n- Verify there's enough space for the entity's full dimensions\n\n3. Belt System Issues\n- Clear blocked transport belts to prevent mining drill stalling\n- Ensure proper connection and flow in belt systems\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- None explicitly defined in the provided logs\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(prototype: Prototype, position: Position, direction: Direction = None) -> Entity\n  Success: Places entity at specified position\n  Failure: When inventory lacks required item or position is blocked\n\nThe system appears to be working towards automation but requires better handling of inventory management and entity placement coordination."}
