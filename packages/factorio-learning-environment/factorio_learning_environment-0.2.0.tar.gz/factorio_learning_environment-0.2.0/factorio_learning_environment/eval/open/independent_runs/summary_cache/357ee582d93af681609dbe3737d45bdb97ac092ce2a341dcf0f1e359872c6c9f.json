This furnace is employed to boost the available iron plates through smelting processes (iron ore and coal are inserted to produce additional iron plates).\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nUsed for smelting copper ore into copper plates. The furnace processes harvested copper ore (with coal) to yield copper plates needed for further production.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 When calling get_entities(), use only the supported argument types. Avoid providing unexpected keyword parameters (like \u201cradius\u201d) or excessive positional arguments to prevent TypeError exceptions.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Iteration Errors  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Confirm that a Lab is present in inventory before attempting placement. Validate returned entity collections (ensuring they are not None) before iterating, to avoid \u201cNoneType\u201d iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Prerequisite Errors  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Ensure all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available prior to attempting to craft a Lab. Establish and verify proper smelting and resource production processes so that complex items can be crafted without missing prerequisites."}
