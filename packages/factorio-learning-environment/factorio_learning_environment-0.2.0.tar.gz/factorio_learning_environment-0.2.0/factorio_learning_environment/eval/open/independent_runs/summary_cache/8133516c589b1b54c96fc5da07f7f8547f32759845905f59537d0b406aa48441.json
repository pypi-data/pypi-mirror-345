{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with inventory containing 722 units of coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, actively working and connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the chest at (42.5, -83.5) to the chest at (40.5, -83.5).\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled by coal, actively working with a result inventory containing 79 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) fueled by coal, actively working with a source inventory containing iron ore and a result inventory containing 78 iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) each containing 5 units of coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Ensure Chest Replenishment:** The chest at position (42.5, -83.5) frequently becomes empty. Consider automating the replenishment process or increasing the storage capacity to prevent interruptions in coal distribution.\n- **Efficient Inventory Management:** Regularly monitor and manage the inventory levels of coal and iron ore to ensure uninterrupted operation of mining drills and furnaces.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined in the provided logs.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources such as 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
