{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (24.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) collecting coal output\n\n### Iron Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) collecting iron ore output (contains 409 iron ore)\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Complex at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining copper ore at (20.0, 20.0)\n- Primary collection chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n- Transfer chest at (22.5, 21.5) containing 321 copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 52 copper plates\n- Complex inserter system:\n  - Inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving ore from collection to transfer chest\n  - Inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving ore from transfer chest to furnace\n  - Inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving plates from furnace to output chest\n  - Support inserters at (20.5, 22.5) and (22.5, 22.5)\n\n### Unused Furnace Group at (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- When reconfiguring inserters, ensure the destination entity is properly placed before changing pickup/drop settings\n- Check that inserters have valid pickup and drop locations before configuring them\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Ensure proper fuel levels in furnaces before starting smelting operations\n- Verify input materials are available before starting smelting process\n- Monitor furnace fuel levels to prevent overfilling (noticed in furnace at 24.0, 20.0)\n\n### Entity Placement Blockage\n- Clear ground items before attempting to place new entities\n- Ensure inserters have proper clearance for their drop locations"}
