{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-7.0,22.5) - REBUILT\n- **New boiler** at (-7.0,22.5) - Fuel level: 13/50\n- **New steam engine** at (-3.5,22.5) - Operational but connection issues persist\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Water supply stable\n- **Steam pipe network** - 6 pipes (rebuilt but connection verification needed)\n- **Fuel supply system**:\n  - Coal chest at (-6.5,19.5) - Contains 84 coal\n  - Burner inserter at (-6.5,20.5) - Operational with 2 coal fuel\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Operational (producing 838 crude oil/min)\n- **Storage tank** at (21.5,40.5) - Contains 9.88 crude oil\n- **Oil pipe network** - 3 pipes connecting pumpjack to storage\n\n### Oil Refinery Complex at (25.5,40.5)\n- **Oil refinery** at (25.5,40.5) - Configured for basic oil processing but experiencing fluid shortages\n- **Power connection** - Connected via rebuilt power network\n- **Fluid connections** - Input connection point at (26.5,43.5) not receiving crude oil\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical System Failures (Updated)\n1. **Steam system connection issues** (occurred 5 times)\n   - Persistent disconnection between boiler and engine\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify exact connection points (boiler output at (-5.5,22.5), engine inputs at (-3.5,20.0) and (-3.5,25.0))\n     - Use direct pipe connections without intermediate branches\n     - Implement connection validation before system startup\n\n2. **Fuel management problems** (occurred 4 times)\n   - Repeated boiler fuel depletion\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement automated fuel transfer system\n     - Maintain minimum 50 coal buffer in chest\n     - Set up fuel level monitoring\n\n3. **Power network instability** (occurred 3 times)\n   - Frequent power pole rebuilding\n   - Solution:\n     - Plan power network layout in advance\n     - Use substations for high-density areas\n     - Implement power grid monitoring\n\n4. **Fluid transfer failures** (occurred 2 times)\n   - Refinery not receiving crude oil\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify pipe connections between storage and refinery\n     - Check pump operation\n     - Monitor fluid levels in storage\n\n### Previous Recommendations Still Valid\n1. Maintain complete system documentation\n2. Implement staged activation procedures\n3. Create isolation procedures for failures\n4. Document all automated systems\n\n### New Critical Issues\n1. **Steam engine connection mismatch**\n   - Engine shows working status but no power output\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify steam temperature and pressure\n     - Check power pole connections\n     - Monitor energy production metrics\n\n2. **Refinery input configuration**\n   - Fluid input point not aligned with storage output\n   - Solution:\n     - Reconfigure pipe connections\n     - Verify refinery input/output points\n     - Implement fluid routing checks\n\n3. **Inventory management**\n   - Repeated coal extraction failures\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement inventory tracking system\n     - Create emergency fuel reserves\n     - Automate resource transfers"}
