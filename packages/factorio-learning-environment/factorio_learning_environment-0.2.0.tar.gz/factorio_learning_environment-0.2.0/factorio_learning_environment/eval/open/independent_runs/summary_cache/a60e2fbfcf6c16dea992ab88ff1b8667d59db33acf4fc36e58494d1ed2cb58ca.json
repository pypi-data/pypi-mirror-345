{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup (steam) connecting from boiler to steam engine with pipes at positions: (x=3.5, y=17.5), (x=4.5, y=17.5), (x=8.5, y=17.5), ..., (x=8.5, y=21.5), (x=9.5, y=21.5), (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n- PipeGroup (water) connecting offshore pump to boiler with pipes at positions: (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=23.5), ..., (x=-2.5, y=23.5), (x=-1.5, y=23.5), (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions: (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=-2.5, y=17.5), (x=10.5, y=17.5), ..., (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=7.5, y=8.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are within a valid range and that there are no obstacles or incorrect alignments preventing the connection.\n- Verify that the correct pipe types are being used for the intended connections. For example, use `Prototype.Pipe` instead of `Prototype.PipeToGround` or `Prototype.UndergroundPipe` if they are not applicable.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Double-check the attributes and methods you are using in your code to ensure they exist. For example, `Prototype` does not have an attribute `PipeToGround`; ensure you are using the correct attribute like `PipeGroup` if applicable."}
