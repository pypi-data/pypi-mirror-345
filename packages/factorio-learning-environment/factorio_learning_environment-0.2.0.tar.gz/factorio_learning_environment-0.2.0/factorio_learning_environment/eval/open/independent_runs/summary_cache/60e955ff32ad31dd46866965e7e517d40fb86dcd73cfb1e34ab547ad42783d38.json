{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal and depositing it into a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-18.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with full output of iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore and depositing it into a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Connected by multiple transport belts facilitating movement of resources.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore and depositing it into a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) moving iron ore from the chest to another chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions storing resources like iron plates, iron ore, and coal.\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various parts of the map, facilitating resource transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Configuration\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with their source and destination entities. Adjust pickup and drop positions as necessary to ensure they can operate without obstruction.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Status\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items and are not left in a waiting state. Ensure that the source chest or entity contains the necessary items for the inserter to function.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Regularly check furnace inventories to ensure they have the necessary ingredients to smelt and that their output is not full. This will prevent furnaces from halting production.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Configuration\n- Confirm that transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to facilitate smooth flow of resources. Misaligned belts can disrupt the transport system."}
