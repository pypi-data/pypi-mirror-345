{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore; currently fueled with coal.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates; fueled and working.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace; currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace; fueled and waiting for space in destination.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest; fueled but waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt; fueled but waiting for source items.\n- Transport belt placed at position (21.5, 73.5) to move iron plates away from the chest.\n\nThis structure forms a connected iron plate production line from ore extraction to plate output onto a belt. The mining drill and furnace are fueled and operational, but inserters are often waiting due to inventory or space constraints. Attempts to place an additional wooden chest at the drill drop position (16.5, 72.5) failed due to lack of inventory.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel management for burner inserters and machines\n- Always ensure sufficient coal is available in inventory before attempting to insert fuel into burner inserters or machines. Multiple insertion attempts failed due to empty inventory.\n- Maintain a buffer of coal in inventory to prevent inserters and machines from running out of fuel, which causes stoppages and reduces throughput.\n\n### Handling item insertion errors due to empty inventory\n- Before inserting items (coal or others), verify inventory contains the required quantity to avoid exceptions.\n- Implement checks or inventory queries prior to insertion commands to prevent runtime errors.\n\n### Managing entity placement failures due to inventory shortages or undefined variables\n- Crafting wooden chests failed because wood, a raw resource, was not gathered first. Gather raw resources before crafting dependent items.\n- Failed to place wooden chest at drill drop position due to no wooden chest in inventory.\n- Reference errors like \"name 'ore_catch_chest' is not defined\" indicate missing or misspelled variable definitions. Ensure all referenced entities are properly defined and initialized before use.\n\n### Inserter operation states and blocking issues\n- Inserters frequently enter WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS or WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION states. Ensure upstream entities produce items and downstream entities or belts have capacity to receive items.\n- The burner mining drill shows warnings about output blocked by items on the ground, indicating no sink entity is available to accept output. Add or correctly position chests or belts to receive mined ore.\n\n### Entity placement and spacing considerations\n- Initial failures placing inserters and belts were due to occupied tiles by other entities. Plan entity placement order and spacing to avoid overlaps.\n- When placing new chests or inserters, confirm inventory availability and free tiles at target positions.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
