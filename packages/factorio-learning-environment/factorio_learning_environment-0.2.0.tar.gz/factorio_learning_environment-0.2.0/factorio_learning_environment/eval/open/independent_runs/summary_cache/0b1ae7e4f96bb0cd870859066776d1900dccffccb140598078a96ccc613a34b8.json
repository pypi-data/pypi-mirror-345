{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an iron chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Various pipe groups and electricity poles scattered across the map, not all connected to active systems.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Steam Engine to Boiler\n- Ensure that there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect small electric poles. Clear any obstacles before placing poles.\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. Ensure you have enough small electric poles to complete the connection.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check that all inserters are connected to a power source. Ensure that the small electric poles are properly connected to provide power to inserters.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations."}
