If a sub-ingredient needs to be crafted, ensure you have the necessary machines and resources for that sub-ingredient. In this case, iron plate needs to be smelted in a furnace before crafting an iron chest.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place a entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\nNo new functions were defined in this step.\n```"}
