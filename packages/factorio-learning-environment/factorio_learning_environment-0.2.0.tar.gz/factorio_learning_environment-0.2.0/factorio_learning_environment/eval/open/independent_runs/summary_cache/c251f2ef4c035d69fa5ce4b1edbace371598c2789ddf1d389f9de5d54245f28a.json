{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Out of fuel\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: 11 units of iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: 4 units of coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Stone furnace at (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: 9 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to refuel or craft items. For example, coal is needed to refuel mining drills and inserters.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect crafting attempts\n- Coal cannot be crafted as it is a raw resource. It must be gathered from the environment.\n\n### Errors due to misaligned inserter setup\n- Regularly check and align inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can cause production halts.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly refuel your mining drills and inserters to prevent them from stopping. Keep a stock of fuel resources like coal in your inventory."}
