{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-11.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-11.5, 18.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### Lab at position(2.5, -18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (2.5, -18.5)\n\n### Electric pole group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (-11.5, 26.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (-8.5, 23.5)\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple pipes connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure there are no obstructions between the offshore pump and the boiler before attempting to connect them. Clear any pipes or other entities that may block the connection.\n- Verify that the positions of the entities you are trying to connect are correct and that they are of compatible types.\n\n### Errors when accessing entities\n- Confirm the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to access it. In this case, ensure that a lab is present at position (2.5, -18.5) before trying to connect or interact with it.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
