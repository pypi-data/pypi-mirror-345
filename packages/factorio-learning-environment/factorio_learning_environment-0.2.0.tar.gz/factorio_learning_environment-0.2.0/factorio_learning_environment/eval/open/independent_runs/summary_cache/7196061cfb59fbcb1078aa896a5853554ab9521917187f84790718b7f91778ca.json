Always ensure an inserter is in place to feed items into the target entity rather than connecting the belt directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine.\n\u2013 When placing entities such as wooden chests, verify that the player is within the allowable placement range. (A reported error indicated a target position was too far from the player.)\n\u2013 Prior to placement, confirm that the required item is present in the inventory to avoid placement failures due to insufficient resources.\n\u2013 Check that variable names are correctly defined and referenced. An undefined variable (e.g. \u201ctarget_chest\u201d) error suggests a need for consistent and precise naming in the command logic."}
