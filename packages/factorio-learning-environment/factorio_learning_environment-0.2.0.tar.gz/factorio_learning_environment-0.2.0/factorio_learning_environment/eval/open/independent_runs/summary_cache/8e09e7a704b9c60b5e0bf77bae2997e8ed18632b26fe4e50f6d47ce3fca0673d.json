{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0), both lacking ingredients to smelt.\n- Transport Belt network connecting these furnaces, with multiple BeltGroups facilitating material movement.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Transport Belt network with BeltGroups facilitating ore movement to various positions.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) moving items to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storage of resources like iron plates and coal.\n- Various BeltGroups configured for material transport across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure continuous placement of belts without gaps to maintain connectivity. Specifically, check positions like (-20.5, -67.5) and (-21.5, -66.5) for gaps.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure inserters have access to source items to prevent them from idling. Check positions like (-20.5, -66.5) and (2.5, 0.5).\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to maintain operation. Notably at positions (53.0, -83.0) and (-14.0, -53.0).\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure furnaces are supplied with necessary ingredients to avoid idle time. Positions like (-20.0, -70.0) and (0.0, 0.0) need attention."}
