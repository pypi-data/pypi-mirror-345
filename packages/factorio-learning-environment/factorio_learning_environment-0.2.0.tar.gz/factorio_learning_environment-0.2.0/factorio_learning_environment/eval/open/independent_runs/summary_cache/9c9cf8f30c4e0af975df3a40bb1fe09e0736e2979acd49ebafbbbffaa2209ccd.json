{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=5.5, y=21.5), generating power.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0), fueled with coal and working.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), supplying water.\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine, ensuring fluid flow.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces** at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=10.0, y=0.0), (x=13.0, y=0.0), and (x=16.0, y=0.0), fueled with coal, producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5), transferring materials between entities.\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Lab** with input of automation science packs, currently not conducting any research due to errors in locating the lab.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5), currently empty.\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), working with water.\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=-0.5, y=22.5), working with steam.\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=-6.5, y=25.5), currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles at positions (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), and (x=1.5, y=6.5), providing power distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure there are no obstructions or incorrect placements when attempting to connect pipes between entities. Verify the path is clear and the correct type of pipe is used.\n\n### Errors in Establishing Fluid Connections\n- When connecting fluid entities like offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines, ensure all connections are properly aligned and there are no blockages along the path.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Power Generation\n- If the steam engine is not generating power, verify all connections are secure and the boiler is receiving adequate fuel and water supply. Check for any misplaced pipes or incorrect connections.\n\n### General Connection Failures\n- Double-check the placement and orientation of pipes and underground pipes to ensure they are correctly aligned with the intended connections.\n\n### NameError for Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that all entity types used in the code are correctly defined and imported. For instance, use the correct entity class names such as `Furnace` or `Lab` and ensure they are properly imported from the entities module.\n\n### Errors in Locating Lab\n- Verify the position of the lab in the game world before attempting to interact with it. Ensure that the lab exists at the specified coordinates and that there are no typos in the position values.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. Check that the supply chain is intact and that the inserters are correctly positioned to pick up items from the source."}
