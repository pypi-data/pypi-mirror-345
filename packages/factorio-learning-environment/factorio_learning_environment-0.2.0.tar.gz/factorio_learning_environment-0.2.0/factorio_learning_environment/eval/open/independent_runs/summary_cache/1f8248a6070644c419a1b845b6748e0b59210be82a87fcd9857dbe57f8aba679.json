{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from chests to another chest.\n  - At position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from furnace to chest.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - At position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests**:\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) storing iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity contains items to be transferred by the inserter. Regularly check and replenish resources in the source entity.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure the destination entity has enough space to receive items from the inserter. Regularly clear or expand storage to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Result Being Full\n- Regularly transfer items from the furnace output to prevent production from halting due to full output inventory.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity is not full or blocked. Consider upgrading storage capacity or improving item flow to prevent blockage."}
