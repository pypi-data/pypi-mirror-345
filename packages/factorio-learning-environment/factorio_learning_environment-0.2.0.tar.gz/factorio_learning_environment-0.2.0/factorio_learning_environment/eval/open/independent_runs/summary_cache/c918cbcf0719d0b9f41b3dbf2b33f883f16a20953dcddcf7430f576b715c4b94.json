{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent attempted to place several entities, but all placement attempts failed. As a result, no structures have been successfully created or placed on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. The agent repeatedly attempted to place various entities (e.g., Wooden Chest, Stone Furnace, ore inserter, plate inserter, output chest) at different coordinates, but all attempts failed, indicating that the tiles might be occupied or otherwise unsuitable for placement.\n\n### Errors related to moving\n- Correctly handle data types when using movement functions. The agent encountered errors when attempting to move, such as \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" and \"'Position' object is not callable.\" Ensure that the movement functions are called with the correct data types and that the 'Position' object is used properly.\n\n### Errors with building box size\n- Adjust the size of the BuildingBox or use multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if no viable placement is found. The agent encountered an error when trying to place a Wooden Chest due to the BuildingBox size being too large for the available space. Consider reducing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller ones to find a suitable placement area."}
