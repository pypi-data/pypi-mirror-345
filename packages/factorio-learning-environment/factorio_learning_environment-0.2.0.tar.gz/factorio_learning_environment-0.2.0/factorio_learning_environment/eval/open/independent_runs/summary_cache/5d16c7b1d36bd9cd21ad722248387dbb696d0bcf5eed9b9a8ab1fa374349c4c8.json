{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-10, -59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 3 Burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), (-6, -59)\n- 3 Wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\nNote: Currently all drills are out of fuel\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 4 Stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0)\n- 4 Coal supply chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- 4 Burner inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5) moving coal from chests to furnaces\n- 4 Burner inserters at positions (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5) moving iron plates from furnaces\n- 4 Collection chests at positions (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5) for storing produced iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing inserters or other entities, check if the target position is already occupied\n- When restructuring a production line, remove existing entities before placing new ones in the same location\n- Consider the tile dimensions of entities when planning placement locations\n\n### Resource management issues\n- Mining drills are non-functional due to lack of fuel - implement a fuel supply system\n- Furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning - ensure proper supply chain of raw materials\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner inserters, especially at position (6.5, 1.5) which has low fuel"}
