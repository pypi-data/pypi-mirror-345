{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Oil extraction setup at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5), a small electric pole at position(19.5, 40.5), a storage tank at position(21.5, 43.5), and a pipe group connecting the pumpjack to the storage tank with pipes at positions (19.5, 38.5), (18.5, 38.5), (20.5, 39.5), (20.5, 38.5), (20.5, 41.5), and (20.5, 40.5). The pumpjack is connected to the electricity network via a small electric pole.\n\n### Boiler setup at position(12.5, 41.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position(12.5, 41.0), an offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5), and a pipe group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler with pipes at positions (-8.5, -0.5), (-7.5, -0.5), (-6.5, 1.5), ..., (10.5, 38.5), (10.5, 41.5), and (10.5, 40.5). The boiler is also connected to a steam engine at position(7.5, 40.5) via a pipe group with pipes at positions (5.5, 37.5), (4.5, 37.5), (7.5, 37.5), ..., (14.5, 43.5), (14.5, 42.5), and (15.5, 42.5).\n\n### Electricity generator at position(7.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a steam engine at position(7.5, 40.5) and is connected to the electricity network via small electric poles at positions (6.5, 42.5) and (5.5, 41.5).\n\n### Oil refinery setup at position(26.5, 45.5)\nConsists of an oil refinery at position(26.5, 45.5) and is connected to the oil extraction setup via a pipe group and to the electricity network via a small electric pole at position(24.5, 42.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using undefined attributes\n- Make sure to use the correct attributes for an entity. Check the entity's documentation for available attributes.\n- The agent attempted to access 'neighbours' attribute of an 'ElectricityGroup' object which does not exist.\n- The agent attempted to access 'Generator' attribute of 'Prototype' which does not exist. Use the correct attribute name.\n- The agent attempted to access 'electrical_id' attribute of a 'Generator' object which does not exist. Use the correct attribute name.\n- The agent attempted to access 'production' attribute of a 'Generator' object which does not exist. Use the correct attribute name.\n\n### Errors when entities are not receiving power\n- Check the power connection and ensure that the entity is properly connected to a power source.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of entities\n- Verify that the entity's inventory is accessible before attempting to inspect it.\n\n### Errors when entities are not working properly\n- Check the entity's status and warnings for any issues, such as lack of fuel or not being connected to a power network.\n\n### Errors when accessing entities that do not exist\n- Verify that the entity exists on the map before attempting to access it.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without fluid\n- Ensure that the source entity has fluid in it before connecting it to an entity that requires fluid input.\n\n### Errors when placing entities or connecting entities\n- Ensure the target location is buildable and not occupied by another entity or water before attempting to place an entity or connect entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with invalid connections\n- Did not find any valid connections between source and target entities. Make sure none of the source or target connections points are blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place a pipe at an occupied position\n- Check if the target position is already occupied by another entity before attempting to place a pipe.\n\n### Errors when executing invalid code\n- Make sure to write valid code. The agent encountered a NameError due to an undefined name 'the'.\n- The agent encountered a TypeError due to bad operand type for unary -: 'type'.\n\n### Errors when boiler is out of fuel\n- Insert fuel into the boiler to continue operation.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place a pipe-to-ground at an occupied position\n- Could not place pipe-to-ground at the target location as there is an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors when steam engine is not connected to power network or fluid source\n-\n\n"}
