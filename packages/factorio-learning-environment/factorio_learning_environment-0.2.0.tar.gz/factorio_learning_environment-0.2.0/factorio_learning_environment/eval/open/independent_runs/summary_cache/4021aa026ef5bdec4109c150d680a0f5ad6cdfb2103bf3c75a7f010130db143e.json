{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) dropping items at (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing iron ore and copper ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with iron plate inventory\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with iron plate inventory\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items\n- Belt Group connecting the mining drill to the furnaces\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) dropping items at (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the belt to the chest\n- Belt Group connecting the mining drill to the chest\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at Position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with iron plate inventory\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Placement\n- Ensure continuous placement of belts without gaps. The error occurred due to a gap detected in belt placement at position (-23.5, -70.5). Verify belt connectivity before finalizing placement.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the inserter has access to source items. The inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) is waiting for source items. Ensure that items are available on the connected belt or chest.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Multiple furnaces reported warnings of no ingredients to smelt. Verify that the input resources are being supplied correctly."}
