{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Area at position(-11.5, 19.5)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n- First stone furnace at position(-11.0, 20.0)\n- Second stone furnace at position(-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational with coal as fuel but currently idle due to lack of input materials.\n\n###Coal Mining Complex at position(20.0, -15.0)\nA series of coal mining setups consisting of:\n- First setup: Burner mining drill at (20.0, -15.0) with burner inserter at (20.5, -13.5)\n- Second setup: Burner mining drill at (22.0, -15.0) with burner inserter at (23.5, -14.5)\n- Third setup: Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0) with wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5)\nThe third setup is currently out of fuel but has a collection chest containing 38 coal.\n\n###Iron Ore Mining Setup at position(-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) for collecting iron ore\nThe setup is currently out of fuel but has collected 116 iron ore.\n\n###Copper Production Complex at position(20.0, 20.0)\nAutomated production line consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) for copper ore mining (currently unfueled)\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0) for smelting (contains 23 copper plates)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - Chest output inserter at (21.5, 21.5)\n  - Furnace input inserter at (22.5, 20.5)\n- Transport belt system with two belt groups:\n  - First group: 4 belts connecting from (23.5, 18.5) to (21.5, 21.5)\n  - Second group: 10 belts connecting from (21.5, 21.5) to (23.5, 18.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors with transport belt conflicts\n- When placing inserters near transport belts, increase the spacing parameter above 0\n- Consider removing conflicting transport belts before placing new inserters\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces, check for transport belt interference in the target position\n- Plan alternative directions for inserter placement when default direction is blocked by belts\n\n### Errors with entity placement conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- When placing inserters, verify there are no transport belts in the target position\n- Consider different positions or directions if the desired location is blocked\n- When expanding existing structures, plan the layout to avoid conflicts with belts\n- When placing chests next to entities, ensure proper spacing to avoid conflicts with existing transport belts\n\n### Errors with inserter output configuration\n- When placing inserters, ensure there is a valid destination entity for the items being moved\n- Configure the inserter's drop position to align with the target entity's input (furnace)\n- The drop position should match the input position of the target entity\n- Remove and replace inserters if their drop positions are incorrect\n\n### Errors with inserter fuel management\n- Always add fuel to burner inserters immediately after placement\n- Keep spare fuel in inventory for inserter refueling\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels to prevent operation interruptions\n\n### Errors with mining drill fuel management\n- Ensure mining drills have sufficient fuel before starting operations\n- Keep coal in inventory for refueling mining drills\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Clear any items on the ground that might block inserter operations\n- Ensure there is a valid receiving entity at the inserter's drop position\n- Verify the receiving entity (like a furnace) has available space for inputs\n- Clear blocked transport belts to allow inserters to continue operations\n\n### Errors with resource availability\n- Verify required resources are in inventory before attempting operations\n- Maintain a steady supply of coal for fueling operations\n- Plan resource gathering to maintain necessary inventory levels"}
