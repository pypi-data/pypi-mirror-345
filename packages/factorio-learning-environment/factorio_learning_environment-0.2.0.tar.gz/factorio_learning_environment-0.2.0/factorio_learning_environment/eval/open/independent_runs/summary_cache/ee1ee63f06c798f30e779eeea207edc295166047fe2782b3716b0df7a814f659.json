{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (9 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is free before attempting to place entities such as Transport Belts, Wooden Chests, and Burner Inserters. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Furnace not producing additional iron plates\n- Verify the setup of the furnace to ensure it has the necessary inputs and fuel. Check for any blockages or misconfigurations that might prevent production.\n\n### Output blocked by item on the ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
