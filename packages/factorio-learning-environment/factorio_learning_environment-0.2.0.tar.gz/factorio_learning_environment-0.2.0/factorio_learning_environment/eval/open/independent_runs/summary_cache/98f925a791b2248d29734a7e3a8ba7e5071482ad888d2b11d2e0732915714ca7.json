{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with fuel\n- Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with fuel\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with fuel\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=19.5, y=-12.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) with water\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) with water\n\n### Electricity Networks\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=23.5, y=-12.5) and (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=-1.5, y=3.5) and (x=-3.5, y=3.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Lab at unspecified position, missing science packs\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5), not receiving electricity\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipe Networks\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly aligned and within reach when connecting pipes between them. Check that the connection points are clear and not obstructed by other entities.\n\n### Errors in Fueling Boilers\n- Verify that you have the necessary fuel in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the boiler. Keep track of your coal reserves to avoid running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters are powered and have a clear path to pick up and drop items. Check that the inserter is connected to a power source and that the source items are available.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status of all entities to ensure they are functioning correctly and have the necessary resources to operate."}
