                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

**Cellnition** is an open source simulator to create and analyze Network Finite
State Machines (NFSMs) from gene regulatory network (GRN) models.

Regulatory networks such as GRNs preside over complex phenomena in biological systems, 
yet given a specific regulatory network, how do we know what it's capable of doing?

**Cellnition** treats regulatory networks as analogue computers, where NFSMs map the sequential
logic inherent in the network as a dissipative dynamic system. As an extension and 
improvement upon attractor landscape analysis, NFSMs reveal the analogue computing 
operations inherent in GRNs, allowing for identification of associated "intelligent 
behaviors".  NFSMs capture the "analog programming" of GRNs, which aim to provide clear identification of:

* Interventions that may induce transitions between stable states (e.g. from "diseased" to "healthy") 
* Identification of path-dependencies, representing stable changes occurring after a transient intervention is applied (e.g. predicting if a transient treatment with pharmacological agent might permanently heal a condition)
* Identification of inducible cycles of behavior that may take the system through a complex multi-phase process (e.g. wound healing). 

NFSMs have a range of potential applications, including the identification of potential strategies to 
renormalize cancer (see `Tutorial 2`_).

Regulatory Network Machine <paper_>`__. Please cite this publication in any work that utilizes **Cellnition**:

Install
=======

**Cellnition** is installable with pip_, the standard package installer
officially bundled with Python_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install cellnition

Documentation
=============

Comprehensive documentation for **Cellnition** is available at our `GitHub Pages hosted site <cellnition docs_>`__.

Features
=========
**Cellnition** embodies a range of functionality, including:

* Work with regulatory networks imported from **Cellnition's** network-library, use **Cellnition** to procedurally generate regulatory networks with random or scale-free degree distributions, or import your own user-defined regulatory networks as directed graphs with activating or inhibiting edge characteristics (see `Tutorial 1`_ and `Tutorial 2`_ for some examples).
* Analyze and characterize regulatory network graphs with a variety of metrics (see the `characterize_graph`_ method and `Tutorial 1`_ and `Tutorial 2`_). 
* Use directed graph representations of regulatory networks to build fully-continuous, differential equation based simulators of network dynamics (see `ProbabilityNet`_ class and `Tutorial 1`_). 
* Use directed graph representations of regulatory networks to build logic equation based Boolean simulators of network dynamics (see `BooleanNet`_ class and `Tutorial 2`_).
* Explore regulatory network dynamics with comprehensive equillibrium state search and characterization capabilities, along with temporal simulators (see `Tutorial 1`_ and `Tutorial 2`_ for some examples).
* Create simulated datasets, including simulation of automated gene-knockout experiments for a continuous regulatory network model (see `GeneKnockout`_ class). 
* Generate Network Finite State Machines (NFSMs) for continuous models (see `Tutorial 1`_) or for Boolean models (see `Tutorial 2`_). 
* Create and export a variety of plots and visualizations, including of the regulatory network analytic equations, regulatory network directed graphs, heatmaps of gene expressions in equilibrium states, gene expressions in temporal simulations, and depictions of the general and event-driven NFSMs (see `Tutorial 1`_ and `Tutorial 2`_ for some examples).     

Tutorials
=========

**Cellnition** tutorials are available as `Jupyter Notebooks <Jupyter_>`__:

* `Tutorial 1`_ : Create NFSMs from a continuous, differential-equation based GRN model.
* `Tutorial 2`_ : Create NFSMs from a Boolean, logic-equation based GRN model.
* `Tutorial 3`_ : Apply a dynamic stimulation to a continuous, differential-equation based GRN model.
* `Tutorial 4`_ : Apply a dynamic stimulation to a Boolean based GRN model.
