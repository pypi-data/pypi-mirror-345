{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Drop position: (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Warning: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (38 units)\n  - Status: NORMAL\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Pickup position: (x=-14.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Drop position: (x=-12.5, y=-51.5)\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the mining drill and the furnace\n  - BeltGroup: Inputs from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction RIGHT\n  - Outputs from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction DOWN\n  - Status: EMPTY\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt, Furnace result is full\n  - Furnace result: Iron Plate (100 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5)\n  - Status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Pickup position: (x=0.5, y=-2.5)\n  - Drop position: (x=0.5, y=-0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt and Inserter Status\n- Ensure that belts and inserters are not blocked. Regularly check for blockages and clear them to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly monitor and empty the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check the furnace's inventory and ensure it is not full to avoid production halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore_inventory`: int (650)\n  - `iron_plate_inventory`: int (922)\n  - `wood_inventory`: int (2)\n  - `stone_inventory`: int (5)\n\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs."}
