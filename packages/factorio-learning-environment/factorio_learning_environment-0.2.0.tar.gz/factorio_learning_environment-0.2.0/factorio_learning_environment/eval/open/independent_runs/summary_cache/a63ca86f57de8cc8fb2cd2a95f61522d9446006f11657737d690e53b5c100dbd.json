{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) that is successfully mining coal and has an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) with an inventory containing iron plates and coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to full chest**: The warning indicates that the chest at drop position is full. To continue mining, ensure to empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) before the Burner Mining Drill attempts to drop off resources.\n- **Errors when the Burner Mining Drill is not collecting more coal**: This may occur if the drill runs out of fuel or if it is not properly connected to a resource. Ensure the drill is adequately fueled and check its connections to resources.\n- **Errors when extracting from the Wooden Chest**: Ensure that the Wooden Chest has enough coal before attempting to extract. The inventory should be monitored to avoid unnecessary extraction attempts when the chest is empty or nearly empty.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - `extract_from_chest(chest_position: Position, item: str) -> None`: Successfully extracts items from the specified chest.\n  - `fuel_burner_mining_drill(drill_position: Position, fuel: str) -> None`: Successfully fuels the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `current_inventory: dict`: {'wood': 6, 'coal': 631, 'iron-plate': 3}\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory: dict`: {'coal': 5}\n  - `burner_mining_drill_inventory: dict`: {'coal': 3}"}
