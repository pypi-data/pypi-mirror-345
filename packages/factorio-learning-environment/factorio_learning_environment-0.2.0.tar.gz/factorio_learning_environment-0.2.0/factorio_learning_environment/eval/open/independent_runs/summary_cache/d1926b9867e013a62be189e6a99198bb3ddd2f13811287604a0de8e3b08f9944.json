{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (52.0, -79.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (53.5, -79.5) configured to transfer items from the furnace to a chest\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (53.5, -78.5) for storing output items\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing mined coal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage at Position (56.5, -78.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (56.5, -78.5) for storing iron plates\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (55.5, -78.5) configured to transfer items to the chest\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Iron Plate Transfer\n- **Issue**: The agent repeatedly encountered errors asserting that iron plates were transferred to the chest.  \n  **Solution**: Ensure the inserter is correctly configured to transfer items from the furnace to the chest. Verify the inserter's pickup and drop positions are accurate.\n\n#### Errors Placing Entities Too Far\n- **Issue**: The agent attempted to place a furnace at a position too far from the player.  \n  **Solution**: Move closer to the target position before placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n#### Errors Accessing Non-Existent Entities\n- **Issue**: The agent tried to access a furnace that was not present at the specified position.  \n  **Solution**: Verify the entity exists at the target position before attempting to interact with it.\n\n#### Errors with Full Chests\n- **Issue**: The mining drill and inserter stopped functioning because the chest was full.  \n  **Solution**: Regularly empty chests to ensure continuous operation of mining and transfer systems.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **place_entity(Prototype, position)**: Used to place entities like furnaces and inserters.  \n  **Failure Modes**:  \n  - Fails if the target position is too far from the player.  \n  - Fails if the target tile is occupied by another entity.  \n\n- **get_entity(Prototype, position)**: Used to retrieve entities at specific positions.  \n  **Failure Modes**:  \n  - Fails if no entity of the specified type exists at the target position.  \n\n#### Important Variables\n- **output_chest**: A reference to the chest used for storing iron plates.  \n- **furnace**: A reference to the stone furnace used for smelting iron ore.  \n- **inventory**: A dictionary tracking the player's inventory items."}
