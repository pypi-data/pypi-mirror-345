{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### None\nNo structures have been created on the map yet.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is present in the inventory before attempting to place it. For example, the agent attempted to place a burner mining drill and a stone furnace without having them crafted or in the inventory.\n\n### Errors related to crafting requirements\n- Verify that all required ingredients for crafting an item are available in the inventory. The agent failed to craft a burner mining drill and a stone furnace due to missing ingredients (iron plates and stones, respectively).\n\n### Errors when referencing undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them. The agent tried to reference `burner_mining_drill` before it was defined, leading to a NameError.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without the necessary machines\n- Make sure to have the appropriate crafting machines or smelting facilities available to craft items. The agent could not craft iron plates because it lacked a furnace.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Invoked multiple times but failed due to missing entities in inventory.\n- `craft_item`: Invoked multiple times but failed due to missing ingredients or machines.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `burner_mining_drill`: Undefined (expected to be defined after crafting).\n- `stone_furnace`: Defined after successful crafting.\n- `coal_patch_position`: Position of the coal patch (type: tuple).\n- `nearest_iron_ore`: Position of the nearest iron ore (type: tuple).\n- `current_inventory`: Dictionary containing items in inventory (type: dict)."}
