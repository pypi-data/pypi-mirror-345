For example, when placing a burner inserter next to a furnace, make sure there are no other entities occupying the space where the inserter will be placed.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on unplaceable terrain or occupied positions\n- Check the terrain and existing entities before placing a new entity. For instance, ensure that the target location is not water or already occupied by another entity.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a Prototype.WoodenChest object as a source. You need to add an inserter that takes items from Prototype.WoodenChest and use the inserter as a source entity.\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to a Prototype.StoneFurnace object as a target. You need to add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.StoneFurnace and use the inserter as the target entity.\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill object as a source. You need to add an inserter that takes items from Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill and use the inserter as a source entity.\n\n#### Errors when accessing non-existent entities or occupied positions\n- Ensure"}
