{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with a burner inserter at position (62.5, -53.5) for input, and a wooden chest at position (61.5, -52.5) for storage.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with a burner inserter at position (65.5, -52.5) for input.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup connecting from position (45.5, -82.5) to (67.5, -54.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting from position (43.5, -80.5) to (63.5, -50.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting from position (42.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -46.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting from position (44.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -54.5).\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure that the path for connecting belts is valid and clear of obstacles. The repeated failures to connect belts from (43.5, -81.5) to (65.0, -51.0) and (66.0, -51.0) suggest that the path normalization is not possible due to invalid pathing. Verify the terrain and existing structures to ensure a clear path.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- The burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) and others are waiting for source items. Ensure that the source entities have the necessary items for the inserters to function properly. Check the supply chain to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- Utility functions and variables have not been explicitly defined or invoked in the logs provided. Ensure to define and document any custom functions or important variables for better code management and debugging."}
