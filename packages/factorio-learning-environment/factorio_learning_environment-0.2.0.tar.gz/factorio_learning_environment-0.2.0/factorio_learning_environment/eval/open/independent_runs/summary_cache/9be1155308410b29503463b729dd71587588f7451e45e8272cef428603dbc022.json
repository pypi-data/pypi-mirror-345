{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring items between entities.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled with coal, extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) fueled with coal, used for smelting operations.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to inserting non-existent items.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and other entities that rely on storage space.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces being full\n- Monitor furnace output inventories and clear them when full to prevent halting of production processes.\n\n### Errors due to no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to maintain continuous production."}
