{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. The agent made several attempts to supply a Lab (intended for research support at position (0.5, 2.5)), but lab placement and crafting repeatedly failed. Although operations involving smelting were performed using an alternative furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0), these were retrieved from existing map entities rather than being newly constructed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage \u2013 get_entities Errors:\n  - Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (such as 'radius') and ensure that only the parameters defined by the API are provided.\n  - Verify the correct number and type of parameters; extra positional arguments can lead to unexpected TypeErrors.\n  \n\u2022 Entity Retrieval and Iteration:\n  - When processing the results of get_entities, check for a None value and use a fallback (e.g., an empty list) to prevent iteration errors.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures:\n  - Confirm that the lab is available in inventory before attempting placement.\n  - Verify that all sub-ingredients required for lab crafting (e.g. iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable) are obtainable through proper smelting or crafting chains.\n\n\u2022 Resource Dependency Management:\n  - Before initiating lab production, ensure that the entire supply chain\u2014from raw materials to intermediate products\u2014is adequately supported to meet recipe requirements."}
