{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: 8 coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Resources: 40,000 iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 8 coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: 9 iron ore\n  - Furnace Result: 92 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is unoccupied before attempting placement. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill to avoid blockage warnings and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with furnace production\n- Regularly check the setup of the furnace to ensure it is properly fueled and has the necessary resources to continue production. If the furnace is not producing additional iron plates, verify that it is correctly configured and supplied."}
