Verify the position and type of the chest.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check if the tile is already occupied by another entity before placing a new entity. Remove any existing entity if necessary.\n\n### Errors due to full inventories\n- Regularly check the inventory capacity of chests and ensure there is enough space before inserting items. Consider adding more storage if needed.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Monitor the source entity's inventory and refill as necessary.\n\n### Errors with inserters blocked by items on the ground\n- Ensure that there is a valid destination for the inserter to place items. Clear any obstructions and ensure the destination has space for incoming items."}
