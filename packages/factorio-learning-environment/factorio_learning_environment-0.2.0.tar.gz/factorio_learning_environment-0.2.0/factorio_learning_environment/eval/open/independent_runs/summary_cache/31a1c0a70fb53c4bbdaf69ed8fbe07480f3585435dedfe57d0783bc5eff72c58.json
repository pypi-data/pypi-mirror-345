{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore (output blocked at belt 15.5,72.5)\n- **Burner inserter** at (17.5, 72.5) moving ore (output blocked)\n- **Transport belt network** connecting drill to furnace (blocked at 15.5,72.5)\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 74.0) for smelting (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-47.5, 74.5) for storage\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) extracting copper ore (working)\n- **Burner inserter** at (-48.5, 72.5) waiting for source items\n- **Transport belt network** connecting drill to furnace\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 74.0) for smelting (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-46.5, 74.5) for storage\n\n#### Power Generation Setup at (-21.5, 70.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-21.5, 70.5) supplying water (working)\n- **Boiler** at (-25.0, 80.5) converting water to steam (fueled)\n- **Steam engine** at (-25.5, 89.5) generating power (working)\n- **Pipe network** connecting components (fluid system 606 for water, 609 for steam)\n\n#### New Storage Area at (28.5, 74.5)\n- **Wooden chest** at (28.5, 74.5)\n- **Burner inserter** at (27.5, 74.5) waiting for source items\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Fluid Connection Issues (4 instances)\n- Verify fluid types match between connected entities (steam engine expects steam but received 'all')\n- Ensure pipe connections are properly aligned between offshore pumps and boilers\n- Clear any obstructions in pipe paths before connection attempts\n\n#### Placement Collisions (2 new instances)\n- Clear existing entities before placing boilers (failed at -25.0,75.5 and -25.0,75.0)\n- Verify target position is clear using `get_entities_at()` before placement\n\n#### Distance Placement Errors (1 new instance)\n- Move within 10 tiles of target position before placing offshore pumps (failed at -20.5,69.5)\n\n#### Existing Issues (from previous report)\n- Clear backed-up transport belts (iron belt at 15.5,72.5)\n- Fuel all furnaces and inserters (multiple entities out of fuel)\n- Verify inserter pickup/drop positions (multiple instances waiting for source items)\n- Maintain proper spacing when placing near existing entities\n- Check power coverage for electrical entities\n\n#### Power System Maintenance\n- Monitor fuel levels in boilers/furnaces\n- Address warnings about blocked outputs promptly\n- Ensure power coverage for all electrical entities\n\n#### Belt Connection Logic\n- Use intermediate inserters between belts and furnaces\n- Verify belt directions form continuous paths\n- Clear debris from belt paths\n\n#### Entity Interaction Errors\n- Verify entity exists and contains items before extraction attempts\n- Check entity status before interaction (WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION etc.)\n\n#### New Errors from Latest Steps\n- **Inventory Management Errors** (2 instances)\n  - Check inventory before attempting to place entities (failed offshore pump placement at -20.5,70.5)\n  - Verify crafting requirements before attempting to craft (failed offshore pump crafting due to missing iron plates)\n\n- **Belt Path Validation** (1 instance)\n  - Ensure valid belt connections between inserters (failed connection between 17.5,72.5 and 28.5,80.5)\n\n- **Terrain Placement Checks** (1 instance)\n  - Verify land is suitable for placement before attempting (failed burner-mining-drill placement at 5.0,5.0 due to water)"}
