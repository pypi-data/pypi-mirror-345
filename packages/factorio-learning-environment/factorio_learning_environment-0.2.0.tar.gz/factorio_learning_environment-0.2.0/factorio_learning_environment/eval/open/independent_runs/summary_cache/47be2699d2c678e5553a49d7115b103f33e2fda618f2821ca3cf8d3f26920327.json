{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n  - The furnace is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It has been fueled with coal and iron ore has been inserted. The furnace is operational when fueled and supplied with iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - The drill is intended to mine iron ore. It is operational when fueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5)\n  - Positioned to collect mined iron ore from the Burner Mining Drill. It has been used to store and extract iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Verify that the entity contains the required items before attempting to extract them. Ensure that the furnace has completed processing and contains the desired output.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Confirm that the inventory contains the items you intend to insert into an entity to prevent insertion errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing an entity is free from other objects to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors related to incorrect data types\n- When defining dimensions or other properties, ensure that the data types are compatible and correctly specified to avoid type errors.\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Avoid using functions that may cause the program to hang or exceed the allowed execution time, such as unnecessary sleep functions.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for crafting\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, gather necessary raw materials like wood for crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Verify that the item you are trying to place is available in your inventory to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to attempting to insert items not present in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors."}
