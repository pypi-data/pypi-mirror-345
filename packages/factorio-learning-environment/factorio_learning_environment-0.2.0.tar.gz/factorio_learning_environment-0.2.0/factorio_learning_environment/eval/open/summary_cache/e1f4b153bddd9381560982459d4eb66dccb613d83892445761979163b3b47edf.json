{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-6.0, -0.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-2.5, -0.5)\n- Pipe group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-6.5, y=-2.5), (x=-7.5, y=-2.5), (x=-8.5, y=-0.5), (x=-7.5, y=-1.5), (x=-7.5, y=-0.5)]\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (15.5, 70.5) with a transport belt connected from (15.5, 72.5) to (15.5, 82.5)\n- Electric mining drill at position (18.5, 70.5) with a transport belt connected from (18.5, 72.5) to (18.5, 82.5)\n- Belt groups transporting iron ore from the drills to the designated output positions\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Electric Connections\n- Ensure that the electric poles are correctly connected to the entities they are meant to power. Check that the positions are valid and the entities are within range.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is not occupied by another object. This will prevent placement errors.\n- Move closer to the target position when placing entities to ensure you are within the maximum allowable distance.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Double-check that there are no obstructions between fluid source and target entities. Ensure that the fluid can flow from the source to the target without any blockages.\n\n### Errors with Function Arguments\n- When using functions that require entity objects as arguments, ensure that the subsequent arguments are correctly provided or set to None if not needed.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that all drills and other power-dependent entities are receiving adequate power. Check connections and power sources to resolve any power supply issues."}
