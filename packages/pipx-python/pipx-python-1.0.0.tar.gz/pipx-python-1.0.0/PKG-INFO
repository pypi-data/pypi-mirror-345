# pipx-python 📦️🪛🐍
**@readwithai** - [X](https://x.com/readwithai) - [blog](https://readwithai.substack.com/) - [machine-aided reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/machineAidedReading/) - [📖](https://readwithai.substack.com/p/what-is-reading-broadly-defined

Run the Python binary corresponding to an application installed with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx). Also swiss-army knife of querying `pipx` virtualenvs.

This is quite useful if you are developing command-line tools installed with `pipx install -e .`, for example to run tests or debug issues.

## 👿 Motivation
I install a lot of command-line tools and make command-line tools. The command-line is fun, easily discoverable and highly composable. Many of these are written in Python.

Distributors have decided to push users into using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx). This works reasonable well, if a bit slow. But one issues is that it makes debugging issues with applications a little different because everything is hidden in a different fiddley virtualenv.

This tool represents tooling I made for myself to make interacting with `pipx` virtualenvs less irritating.

## 🐍📭️🪛️ Installation
You can install `pipx-python` using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):
```
pipx install pipx-python
```

## 📦🪛️🐍 Usage
If you for example installed `llm` with `pipx` then you can run the version of python correponding with this app using:
```
pipx-python llm
```

To find the path to the virtualenv, use can use the `--venv` flag.
```
pipx-python llm --venv
```

## 🤑 Support this tool
If you like this tool you could give me money ($1 maybe) on my [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/readwithai).

You could also look at some of the [other command-line tools](https://readwithai.substack.com/p/my-productivity-tools) I have created.
