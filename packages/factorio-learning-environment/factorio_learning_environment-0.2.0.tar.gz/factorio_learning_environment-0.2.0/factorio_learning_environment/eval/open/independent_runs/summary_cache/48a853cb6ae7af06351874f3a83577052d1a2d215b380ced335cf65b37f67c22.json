{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 2.5)\n\n### Lab at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 3.5, 0.5) which requires 10 automation science packs to complete automation research and is currently not powered.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0, 0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace (position 2, 0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) which is currently empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new poles\n- Ensure that the first argument when placing a new pole is a valid Prototype object. Review the API documentation for correct usage.\n\n### Errors related to lab power\n- The lab requires power to function. Ensure that electric poles are properly placed and connected to provide power to the lab.\n\n### Errors when insufficient ingredients for research\n- Ensure you have enough automation science packs (10 required) to complete the automation research. Check your inventory and gather the necessary items.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target location."}
