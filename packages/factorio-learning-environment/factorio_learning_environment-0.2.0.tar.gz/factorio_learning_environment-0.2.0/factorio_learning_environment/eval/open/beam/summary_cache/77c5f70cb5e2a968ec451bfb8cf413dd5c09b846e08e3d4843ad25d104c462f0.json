{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Currently has no ingredients to smelt\n  - Has produced iron plates, with 2 remaining in the furnace\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Operational and mining coal\n  - Drops mined coal at position (40.5, -83.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -83.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Positioned to collect mined coal\n  - Currently has no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -84.5)\n  - Positioned to transfer coal from the drill to the furnace\n  - Pickup position at (40.5, -83.5) and drop position at (40.5, -85.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure that all required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, attempting to place a burner inserter without having it in the inventory resulted in errors.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Process\n- Verify that all necessary raw materials are collected before crafting items. The agent encountered issues when trying to craft a stone furnace without gathering stone first.\n\n### Assertion Errors in Production\n- Monitor production outputs closely to ensure that the required quantities are met. The agent encountered multiple assertion errors due to insufficient iron plates being smelted.\n\n### Errors in Resource Collection\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is correctly positioned to collect resources from the mining drill. An assertion error indicated that the stone furnace was not collecting coal as expected. Repeated attempts to reposition the furnace at (41.0, -83.0) and (41.0, -85.0) failed to resolve the issue, suggesting a potential misalignment or blockage in resource flow. Consider checking the alignment of the inserter and ensuring it is operational.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. The agent faced issues when trying to place a burner inserter on an occupied tile. Consider adjusting the spacing or changing the reference position.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Ensure that the items you are trying to insert are available in your inventory. The agent attempted to insert coal without having it in the inventory, resulting in errors.\n\n### Errors with Entity Retrieval\n- Ensure that the correct entity type and position are specified when retrieving entities. An error occurred when trying to retrieve a stone furnace at an incorrect position, indicating that no entity was found at the specified location. Double-check entity positions and types before retrieval attempts.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Avoid using attributes that do not exist for the object. An error occurred due to attempting to access a non-existent 'name' attribute on a 'Position' object. Ensure that the attributes being accessed are valid for the object type.\n\n### Misalignment Errors\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is aligned with the burner inserter's drop position. The agent encountered repeated misalignment errors, indicating that the stone furnace was not correctly positioned to collect coal from the inserter. Double-check the positioning and alignment of entities to prevent resource flow issues."}
