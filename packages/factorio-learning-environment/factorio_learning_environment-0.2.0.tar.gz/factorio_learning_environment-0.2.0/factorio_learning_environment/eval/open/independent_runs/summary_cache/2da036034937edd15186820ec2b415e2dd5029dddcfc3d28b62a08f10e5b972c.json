{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop chest at position (4.5, -58.5). The drill is currently operational and fueled with coal. It has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, -58.5) and (4.5, -56.5) used for storing iron ore. The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains 10 iron ore, and the chest at (4.5, -56.5) contains 591 iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-16.5, -54.5), (-15.5, -54.5), (-14.5, -54.5), and (-13.5, -54.5). The chests at (-16.5, -54.5) and (-15.5, -54.5) each contain 600 iron plates. The chests at (-14.5, -54.5) and (-13.5, -54.5) are currently empty.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). Each furnace is fueled with coal but has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt. The furnaces have produced iron plates, with inventories of 22, 22, and 45 iron plates, respectively.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to move items to storage chests\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the items you are trying to move before attempting to transfer them to storage chests. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No iron-plate to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when refueling without available resources\n- Verify that you have sufficient fuel resources in your inventory before attempting to refuel machines. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing raw materials\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, ensure you have enough wood before crafting wooden chests, as wood is a raw resource that must be gathered, not crafted.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `craft_item(Prototype.WoodenChest, quantity=5)`: Attempts to craft wooden chests. Failed due to missing raw material (wood).\n\n### Important Variables\n- `crafted_chests`: Intended to store crafted wooden chests, but crafting failed due to insufficient wood.\n- `inventory`: Tracks current resources, including 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
