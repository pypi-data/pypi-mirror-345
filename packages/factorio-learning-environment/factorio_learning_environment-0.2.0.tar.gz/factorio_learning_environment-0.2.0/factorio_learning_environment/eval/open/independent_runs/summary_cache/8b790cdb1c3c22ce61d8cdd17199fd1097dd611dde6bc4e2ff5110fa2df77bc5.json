{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, with pipes at positions such as (-45.5, -123.5), (-44.5, -123.5), (-43.5, -123.5), etc.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) fueled by coal, producing copper plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) fueled by coal, producing iron plates.\n\n### Additional Furnace\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) fueled by coal, currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the chest and a small electric pole, but currently not operational due to lack of power.\n\n### Laboratory\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not operational due to lack of power.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nVarious PipeGroups are present, such as:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-50.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-45.5, -123.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -120.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-45.5, -120.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-43.5, -118.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions indicating extensive piping infrastructure.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (5.5, -54.5), (7.5, -51.5), (10.5, -51.5), etc., but currently not supplying power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before attempting to place a pipe. Check the target location for obstructions.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Steam Engines to Electric Poles\n- Verify that the connections between electric poles and steam engines are possible and that the positions are correct. Ensure that the steam engine is correctly aligned with the electric pole.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Check that the steam engine is connected to a functional power network and that it receives the necessary input liquid. Ensure that all components are correctly connected and operational.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that the inserter is connected to a powered electric pole and that the electricity network is operational. Ensure that the electric poles are correctly connected and supplying power.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inventory and supply chain to ensure continuous production."}
