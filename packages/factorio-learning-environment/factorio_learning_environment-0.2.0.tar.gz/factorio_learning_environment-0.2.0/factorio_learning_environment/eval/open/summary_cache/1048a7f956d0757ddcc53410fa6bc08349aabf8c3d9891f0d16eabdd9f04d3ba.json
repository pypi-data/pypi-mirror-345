{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to no sink entity.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (19.5, 75.5) adjacent to the furnace, serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (20.5, 75.5) with spacing=1, moving iron plates from furnace to chest.\n- Small electric poles at (17.5, 69.5) and nearby positions forming part of the electricity network, though placement of additional poles near furnace was blocked by existing entities.\n\nThis structure enables extraction of iron ore, smelting into iron plates, and storage of output, but currently faces output blockage at the mining drill due to lack of a proper output sink beyond the furnace.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, connected to offshore pump by pipes.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5) to provide power network connectivity.\n\nThis structure generates electricity from steam power, forming the power source for the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- When placing entities next to others (e.g., burner inserter next to furnace, small electric poles near furnace or mining drill), placement failed due to existing entities occupying the target tile.\n- To avoid this, check for entity presence at intended placement positions before placing new entities.\n- Increase spacing, change direction, or adjust reference position when placing entities next to others to find free tiles.\n\n### Incorrect attribute access on electricity groups\n- Attempted to access 'energy' attribute on an ElectricityGroup object, which does not exist.\n- Instead, check individual electric poles or power sources for energy status.\n- Use appropriate API calls or properties to verify power availability.\n\n### Output blockage at electric mining drill\n- Mining drill status showed \"output blocked by item on the ground\" and \"no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- Ensure that the mining drill\u2019s output position is connected to a belt, chest, or inserter to accept mined items.\n- Place inserters or belts immediately at the drill\u2019s output position to prevent blockage.\n\n### Boiler running out of fuel and steam engine not connected properly\n- Boiler reported \"out of fuel\" warning and steam engine showed \"not connected to power network\" and \"no input liquid.\"\n- Regularly insert fuel into boilers to keep steam generation active.\n- Verify pipe connections and fluid flow to ensure steam engine receives steam.\n- Confirm electric poles connect steam engine to the power network.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
