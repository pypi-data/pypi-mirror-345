{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup (Partial)\n*   Consists of an Offshore Pump at `Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5)` connected via pipes (`PipeGroup` starting at `x=-8.5 y=-0.5`) to a Boiler at `Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5)`. The boiler currently has no fuel.\n*   A Steam Engine is placed at `Position(x=0.5, y=6.5)`, but it is not yet connected to the boiler output via pipes (`PipeGroup` starting at `x=-6.5 y=3.5` exists but is empty and not connected to the engine). The steam engine has no fluid input and is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\n*   Consists of an Electric Mining Drill at `Position(x=17.5, y=1.5)` (currently without power).\n*   The drill drops coal into a Wooden Chest at `Position(x=17.5, y=3.5)`.\n*   A Burner Inserter at `Position(x=17.5, y=4.5)` moves coal from the first chest to a second Wooden Chest at `Position(x=17.5, y=5.5)`.\n*   A Burner Inserter at `Position(x=17.5, y=6.5)` moves coal from the second chest onto a belt system (`BeltGroup` starting at `x=17.5 y=7.5`). This belt system transports coal eastwards.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup (Partially Built, Faulty)\n*   **Mining:** An Electric Mining Drill at `Position(x=17.5, y=72.5)` (currently without power) drops iron ore into a Wooden Chest at `Position(x=17.5, y=74.5)`.\n*   **Ore Transport:** A Burner Inserter at `Position(x=17.5"}
