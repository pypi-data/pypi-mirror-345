{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area (x=1-5, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of three parallel smelting lines:\n- Furnace at (1,1) with burner inserter (1.5,2.5) outputting to chest (1.5,3.5)\n- Furnace at (3,1) with burner inserter (3.5,2.5) outputting to chest (3.5,3.5)\n- Furnace at (5,1) with burner inserter (5.5,2.5) outputting to chest (5.5,3.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Area (x=2-4.5, y=7-9.5)\nTwo parallel smelting lines with belt transport:\n- Furnace at (2,7) with burner inserter (2.5,8.5) outputting to chest (2.5,9.5)\n- Furnace at (4,7) with burner inserter (4.5,8.5) outputting to chest (4.5,9.5)\n- Belt system connecting the output chests\n- Additional burner inserter (3.5,9.5) for material transfer\n\n### Copper Cable Production Line (x=14.5, y=11.5-14.5)\nAssembly line setup:\n- Input chest at (14.5,11.5)\n- Burner inserter at (14.5,12.5)\n- Assembling machine at (14.5,14.5)\n- Output handling with burner inserters and chests at (11.5,14.5)\n\n### Electronic Circuit Production Line (x=21.5, y=11.5-15.5)\nAssembly line setup:\n- Input chests at (21.5,11.5) for iron plates and (21.5,12.5) for copper cables\n- Burner inserter at (21.5,13.5)\n- Assembling machine at (21.5,15.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-5.5 to 13.5, y=26.5-40.5)\nComplete power generation setup:\n- Offshore pump at (2.5,35.5)\n- Boiler at (7.0,35.5)\n- Steam engine at (13.5,35.5)\n- Pipe network connecting components\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple poles\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Assembling Machine Resource Management\n- Ensure consistent supply of raw materials to prevent ingredient shortages in assembling machines\n- Monitor input chest inventory levels to maintain production flow\n\n### Fluid System Connectivity\n- When placing offshore pumps, ensure they are connected to the intended fluid network\n- One offshore pump at (-5.5,26.5) shows \"No fluid present in connections\" warning\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- Monitor and balance input/output ratios to prevent bottlenecks\n- Several inserters show \"waiting for source items\" status, indicating potential supply chain issues\n\n### Chest Management\n- Some chests are showing full status - implement better item extraction logic\n- Balance chest capacities with production rates to prevent overflow or shortages"}
