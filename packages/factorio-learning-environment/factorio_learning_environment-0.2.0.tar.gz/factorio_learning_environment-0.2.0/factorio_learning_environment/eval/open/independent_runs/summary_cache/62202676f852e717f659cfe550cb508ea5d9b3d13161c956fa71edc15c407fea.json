{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe group (position 5.5, 5.5) that connects the offshore pump to the water source.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and producing copper plates.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) that connects to the furnace (position 10.0, 1.0) and the lab (position 6.5, 1.5).\n- Lab (position 6.5, 1.5) for conducting research.\n- Additional furnace (position 10.0, 1.0) which is currently out of fuel.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure there are no blocking entities at the target location before attempting to place a small electric pole. If the area is obstructed by other entities or terrain (like water), the placement will fail.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the specified position contains the correct entity type before attempting to retrieve it. If the entity is not present at the specified coordinates, it will result in an error. In this case, ensure that a steam engine exists at position (10.0, 0.0) before calling for it."}
