{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump and the boiler at positions: (-9.0, 26.0), (-6.5, 25.0), (-5.5, 25.0), (-7.5, 23.5), (-12.5, 23.5)\n- Electric Pole at position (-13.5, 24.5) intended to connect the steam engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) for transferring materials\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage\n- Small Electric Pole at position (17.5, -0.5) connecting the inserters to the power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine and Boiler Connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine and boiler are properly connected with pipes and have a continuous flow of water from the offshore pump. Check for any missing pipes and ensure they are placed correctly.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Place electric poles in proximity to inserters to provide them with electricity.\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Connection\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the boiler with pipes. Ensure there are no gaps in the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target position is free from obstructions and that the entity can be placed without conflicts."}
