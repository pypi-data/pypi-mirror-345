{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully established on the map. The agent attempted to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) to supply Automation Science Packs for research, but all placement and crafting efforts failed due to resource shortages and missing sub-ingredients. Although existing smelting furnaces (one at (5.0, 5.0) used for iron plate production and another at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) used for copper plate production) were retrieved and utilized during processing, none of these efforts resulted in the creation of a new on\u2010map structure.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Misuse with get_entities:\n  \u2013 When retrieving entities, use the correct function signature. Avoid supplying unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional parameters.\n  \u2013 If the retrieval call may return None, implement a fallback (for example, converting a None result to an empty list) before iterating.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Issues:\n  \u2013 Confirm that the Lab item exists in the inventory prior to attempting placement.\n  \u2013 Verify that the target tile at (0.5, 2.5) is unoccupied and valid for placement to avoid placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Failures:\n  \u2013 Ensure all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, and their precursors like iron plates and copper plates) are available or can be produced with the existing production chains.\n  \u2013 Establish supporting processes (for example, setting up furnaces or assembling machines for smelting and crafting) to satisfy complex recipe requirements before attempting to craft the Lab.\n\nNo additional utility functions have been defined by the agent in these steps."}
