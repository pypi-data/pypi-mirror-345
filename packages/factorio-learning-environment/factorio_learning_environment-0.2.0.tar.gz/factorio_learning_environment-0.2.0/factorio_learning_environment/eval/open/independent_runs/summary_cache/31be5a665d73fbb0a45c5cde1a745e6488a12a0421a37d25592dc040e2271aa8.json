{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 26.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 26.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 26.5)\n- Note: There is an attempt to connect these entities using pipes, but the connection has failed.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and within a reasonable distance. The error \"Failed to connect {'Pipe'} from boiler at x=-3.5 y=26.0 to steam-engine at x=5.5 y=26.5\" suggests that the connection between the boiler and steam engine was not successful. Verify the alignment and distance between these entities to ensure a successful connection.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities(existing_boiler, get_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, Position(x=5.5, y=26.5)), Prototype.Pipe)`: This function is intended to connect a boiler to a steam engine using pipes. The failure mode indicates that the connection attempt was unsuccessful, possibly due to distance or alignment issues.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: List of pipes intended for connecting entities. The current layout is not successful, indicating a need for adjustment in positioning or alignment.\n"}
