{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is currently operational but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), and (x=4.5, y=-58.5). These chests are used for storing mined resources.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0). These furnaces are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. They currently have warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt, and one furnace has a full fuel source.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel drills. Lack of fuel can halt mining operations.\n- Maintain an adequate supply of iron ore in the inventory to distribute to furnaces. Without iron ore, furnaces cannot produce iron plates.\n\n### Storage Management Errors\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int, representing the amount of coal in the inventory.\n  - `iron-ore`: int, representing the amount of iron ore in the inventory.\n  - `iron-plate`: int, representing the amount of iron plates in the inventory.\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int, representing the amount of iron gear wheels in the inventory."}
