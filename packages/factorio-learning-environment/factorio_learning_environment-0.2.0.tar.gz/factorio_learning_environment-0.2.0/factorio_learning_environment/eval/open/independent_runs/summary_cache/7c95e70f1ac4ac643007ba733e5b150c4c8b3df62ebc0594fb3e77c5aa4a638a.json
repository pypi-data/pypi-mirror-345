{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). This structure is intended to generate electricity using steam produced from water heated in the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest (position -4.5, -63.5) for storage of items.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(47.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) that extracts copper ore.\n- Wooden chest (position 46.5, -83.5) for storage of coal.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups at various positions:\n- PipeGroup (position -2.5, 3.5)\n- PipeGroup (position 0.5, 3.5)\n- PipeGroup (position 5.5, 2.5)\n- PipeGroup (position 1.5, 7.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -8.5, 24.5)\n\n### Belt group at position(40.5, -84.5)\nConsists of:\n- Input belt (position 40.5, -84.5) directing items to (42.5, -84.5).\n- Output belt (position 43.5, -83.5) directing items to (41.5, -83.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to missing pipes\n- Ensure to have pipes in inventory before attempting to connect the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Ensure the Offshore Pump is in inventory before trying to place it.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
