{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) supplying iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Copper Mining Drills\n- Ensure the target position for placing the Burner Mining Drill is viable and not obstructed. Consider using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes or adjusting the BuildingBox size to fit the map's terrain.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of coal to insert into mining drills and furnaces. Check your inventory before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Resources\n- Ensure there are available resources for extraction before attempting to extract from mining drills.\n\n### Errors When Inspecting Inventory\n- Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to inspect its inventory. Ensure the entity is correctly initialized and positioned.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `get_entity(Prototype, Position)`: Attempts to retrieve an entity of a specified prototype at a given position. Ensure the entity exists at the specified position to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_drill`: Represents a Burner Mining Drill entity intended for copper extraction.\n- `iron_drill`: Represents a Burner Mining Drill entity intended for iron extraction.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents a Stone Furnace entity intended for copper smelting.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents a Stone Furnace entity intended for iron smelting.\n\nEnsure that these variables are correctly initialized and updated to reflect the current state of the game entities."}
