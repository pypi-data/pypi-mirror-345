To resolve this, verify that the target for a belt connection is a proper inserter (or a similar valid entity) rather than a steam engine.\n\n\u2013 Errors when placing wooden chests include instances of:\n\u2003\u2022 The target position being too far from the player. Always move closer to the desired placement location to meet the maximum allowed distance.\n\u2003\u2022 Missing inventory items (no wooden chest available) and referencing undefined variables (e.g. NameError for target_chest). Ensure the required entity is in inventory and that all variables used for placement are correctly defined before use."}
