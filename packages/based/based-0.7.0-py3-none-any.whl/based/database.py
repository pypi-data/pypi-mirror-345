        It will initialize the required backend depending on the provided database URL.
        Currently, PostgreSQL with psycopg and psycopg_pool and SQLite with aiosqlite
        are supported.

        Instead of calling connect and disconnect methods explicitly, you can use the
        Database object as an asynchronous context manager:

            async with based.Database(url) as database:
                async with database.session() as session:
                    await session.execute(query)

        Args:
            url:
                Database URL should be a URL defined by RFC 1738, containing the correct
                schema like `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`. Can be
                omitted in favor of passing parameters separately.
            username:
                Database username.
            password:
                Database password.
            host:
                Database host.
            port:
                Database port.
            database:
                Database name.
            schema:
                Used database schema. Can be `postgresql` or `mysql`.
            force_rollback:
                If this flag is set to True, then all the queries to the database will
                be made in one single transaction which will be rolled back when the
                database is disconnected. This mode is intended to be used in tests.
            use_lock:
                If this flag is set to True, each session, obtained from this object,
                will share an asynchronous lock preventing them to be used in parallel.
                This is forced in the force_rollback mode, where all the connections are
                actually just one connection with a transaction, which may lead to
                unexpected bugs.
