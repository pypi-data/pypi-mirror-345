The final repositioning placed the target inserter at (6.5, y=9.5), though underground belt connection still fails to normalize a proper path.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Inventory and Dependency Verification:\n\u2003- Ensure burner-inserters are available in inventory before attempting placement. If an error states \u201cNo burner_inserter in inventory,\u201d craft additional units prior to placement.\n\u2003- Verify that all prerequisite entities (such as the target inserter) are successfully placed before initiating connection operations.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement and Spacing:\n\u2003- Confirm that targeted placement positions are unoccupied and within the allowed distance relative to the player\u2019s location. Errors citing \u201ctarget position is too far\u201d indicate that the chosen location exceeds the maximum permitted distance; adjust the player\u2019s position accordingly.\n\u2003- Perform buildability checks on candidate tiles to prevent conflicts with existing entities.\n\n\u2022 Connection Path Normalization:\n\u2003- Use strictly grid-aligned and unobstructed routes when forming underground belt connections. \u201cNot a valid path to normalise\u201d errors point to misalignment or obstructed segments; ensure segments align with the transport belt grid.\n\u2003- When employing intermediate waypoints or multi-segment connections, verify that each segment forms a valid, continuous path.\n\n\u2022 Corridor Reassessment and API Integrity:\n\u2003- Reassess selected corridors and intermediate connection points when repeated failures occur. Clearing obstructions or choosing an alternative alignment may help in forming a continuous network.\n\u2003- Adhere strictly to API parameter requirements (e.g., proper handling of entity position attributes) to avoid argument errors during placement or connection procedures."}
