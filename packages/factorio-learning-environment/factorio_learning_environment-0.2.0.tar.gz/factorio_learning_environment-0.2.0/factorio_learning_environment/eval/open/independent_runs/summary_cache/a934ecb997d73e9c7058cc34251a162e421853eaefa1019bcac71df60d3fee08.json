Always use an inserter (or appropriate input entity) as the final target for belt connections.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Issues\n\u2003\u2013 When placing a wooden chest, ensure that the target position is within the allowed distance from the player (max distance ~10) to avoid placement failures.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required entity (e.g., wooden-chest) is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid undefined variable errors (such as referencing \u201ctarget_chest\u201d without definition) by double-checking variable names before use."}
