{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Collection and Transfer System at Position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0), which is operational and fueled with coal. It is currently working but has warnings about output being blocked due to lack of a sink entity.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5), which is repositioned multiple times to align with the drill's drop position. It is fueled and waiting for source items to transfer coal to a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest intended to be placed at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to collect coal, but placement issues persist.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0), which is operational and fueled with coal. It processes iron ore into iron plates. The furnace is currently working with a source of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### TypeError in BuildingBox Initialization\n- Ensure that the arguments passed to `int()` are strings, bytes-like objects, or real numbers. Avoid using attributes that are not compatible with `int()` conversion.\n\n### Errors with 'Position' Object Not Callable\n- Verify that the 'Position' object is correctly instantiated and used. Ensure that you are not attempting to call a 'Position' object as if it were a function.\n\n### Errors with Placing Entities at Occupied Positions\n- Before placing an entity, check the intended position to ensure it is not already occupied by another object. Adjust the position or remove the obstructing object to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Regularly check and adjust the inserter's position to ensure it aligns correctly with the drill's drop position. This will prevent issues with item transfer.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Connection\n- Ensure that you have the required transport belt items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. Plan your inventory management to avoid running out of necessary items.\n\n### Warnings about Output Blockage\n- Address warnings from entities like the Burner Mining Drill, indicating that the output is blocked. Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to receive the output and prevent production halts."}
