{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Furnace at position (4.0, -60.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (4.0, -60.0): Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently contains 9 coal as fuel and 3 iron plates as output. The furnace is in a \"no ingredients to smelt\" state, indicating it lacks iron ore for further smelting.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, the agent tried to place a stone furnace without having one in its inventory.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities that do not contain the expected items\n- Verify that the entity contains the items you are trying to extract before attempting extraction. The agent repeatedly tried to extract iron plates from the furnace before it had produced any, leading to multiple errors.\n\n#### Errors due to insufficient smelting inputs\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel and the required ingredients (e.g., iron ore) before starting the smelting process. The agent encountered a smelting timeout because the furnace lacked sufficient iron ore to continue smelting.\n\n#### Repeated extraction attempts without checking entity status\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to extract items without verifying the entity's status or contents. The agent made multiple extraction attempts for iron plates without checking if the furnace had produced any, resulting in unnecessary errors.\n\n#### General tips for avoiding placement and extraction errors\n- Always check the inventory for required items before placing entities.\n- Verify the contents and status of entities before attempting to extract items.\n- Monitor the smelting process to ensure the furnace has both fuel and ingredients to avoid timeouts."}
