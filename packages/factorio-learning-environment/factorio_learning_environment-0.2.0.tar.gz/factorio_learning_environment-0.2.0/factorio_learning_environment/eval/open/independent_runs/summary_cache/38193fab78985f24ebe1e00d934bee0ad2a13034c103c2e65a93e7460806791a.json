{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0) which is currently working.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) which is waiting for source items.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) which is working and has coal in its inventory.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which currently has no ingredients.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when using inserters without fuel**\n  - Ensure that inserters have sufficient fuel before attempting to operate them. Check the inventory of the inserter and add fuel if necessary.\n\n- **Errors when trying to connect belts directly to a wooden chest**\n  - Use an inserter to input items into the Wooden Chest instead of attempting to connect transport belts directly to it.\n\n- **Errors when entities are waiting for source items**\n  - Verify that the source entities (like chests or drills) have the necessary items available for the inserter to operate.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `connect_entities(entity1, entity2, prototype)`: This function is used to connect entities such as belts and inserters. It failed when trying to connect a belt directly to a Wooden Chest.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `current_inventory: dict`: Holds the current inventory of the agent.\n  - `wooden_chest_position: tuple`: Position of the Wooden Chest (42.5, -81.5).\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position: tuple`: Position of the Burner Mining Drill (42.0, -83.0).\n  - `burner_inserter1_position: tuple`: Position of the first Burner Inserter (42.5, -80.5).\n  - `burner_inserter2_position: tuple`: Position of the second Burner Inserter (43.5, -81.5).\n  - `stone_furnace_position: tuple`: Position of the Stone Furnace (0.0, 0.0)."}
