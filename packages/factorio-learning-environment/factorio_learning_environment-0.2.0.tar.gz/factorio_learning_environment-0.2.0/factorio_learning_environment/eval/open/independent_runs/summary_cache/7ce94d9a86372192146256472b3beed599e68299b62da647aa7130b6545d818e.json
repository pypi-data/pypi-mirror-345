Ensure to add an inserter to input items into the target entity before attempting a belt connection.\n\u2013 When placing entities (e.g. wooden chests), verify that the target position is within the allowed placement range. Move closer if the target is too far and confirm the entity exists in the inventory.\n\u2013 A NameError (as with the undefined \u201ctarget_chest\u201d) indicates that all variables must be correctly defined and referenced. Double\u2010check naming conventions and available variable names before use.\n\u2013 Inventory shortages (such as \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d) require confirming sufficient stock prior to placement actions to avoid resource\u2013related errors."}
