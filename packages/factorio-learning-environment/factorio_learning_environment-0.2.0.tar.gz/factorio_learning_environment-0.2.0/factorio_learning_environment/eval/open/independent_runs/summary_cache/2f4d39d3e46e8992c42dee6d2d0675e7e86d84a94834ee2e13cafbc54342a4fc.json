{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20, -70)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23, -68) with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5) and connected to a Wooden Chest at (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20, -70) with no ingredients to smelt and a full fuel source.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (0, 0) and (5, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0, 0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (5, 0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Line at Position (-14, -54.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14, -53) with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5) and connected to a Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items and connected to a Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Storage at Various Positions\nConsists of multiple Wooden Chests storing copper ore at positions:\n- (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), (0.5, -2.5), (0.5, -3.5), (5.5, -2.5), (5.5, -3.5), (6.5, 0.5), (7.5, 0.5), (9.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5), (0.5, 2.5), (0.5, 3.5), (5.5, 2.5), (5.5, 3.5), (0.5, 4.5), (5.5, 4.5).\n\n### Belt System for Material Transport\nConsists of the following BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable\n- Ensure that you are using the correct method to interact with entities. The 'pickup_entity' function should be used with the correct entity type and parameters.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
