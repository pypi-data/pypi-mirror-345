Adjust your code to pass the correct type.\n\n### Errors when Inspecting Inventory of Transport Belt\n- Verify that the transport belt entity is correctly referenced and exists in the game world before attempting to inspect its inventory. Check for nil values and ensure the entity is initialized properly."}
