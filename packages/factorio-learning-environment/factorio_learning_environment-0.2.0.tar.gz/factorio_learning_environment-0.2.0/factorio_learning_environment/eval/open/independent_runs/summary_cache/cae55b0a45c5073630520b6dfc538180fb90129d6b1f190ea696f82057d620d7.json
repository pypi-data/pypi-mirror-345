{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Iron Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n- Copper Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0)\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-79.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into drills or furnaces. This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory.\n\n### Errors when Furnaces are Out of Fuel or Ingredients\n- Regularly check fuel levels and ingredient availability in furnaces to ensure continuous operation. This will help avoid warnings like \"out of fuel\" or \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Investigate and optimize any processes or functions that may be causing timeouts to ensure smoother operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Function used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the inventory has the required items before calling this function to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity.\n- `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n- `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity."}
