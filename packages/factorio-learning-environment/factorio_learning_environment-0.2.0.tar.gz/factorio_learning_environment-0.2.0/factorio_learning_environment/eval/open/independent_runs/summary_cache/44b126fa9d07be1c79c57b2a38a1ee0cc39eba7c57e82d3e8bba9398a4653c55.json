The agent repeatedly attempted to supply a Lab for Automation Science Pack research at Position(0.5, 2.5) but did not manage to place a Lab due to resource and inventory shortfalls. Pre\u2010existing production facilities were referenced during recovery:\n \n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0)\nUsed to smelt iron ore and coal into iron plates needed for downstream crafting. The furnace was retrieved for processing 10 iron ore and 10 coal into additional iron plates.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\nUsed to process harvested copper ore and coal into copper plates, a key component for producing copper cables required in the Lab crafting chain.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Parameter Errors\n  \u2013 Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments. The get_entities call initially used a \u2018radius\u2019 keyword and later incorrectly passed multiple positional arguments. Verify the API\u2019s signature and use only supported parameter formats.\n\n\u2022 Iteration on Potential None Results\n  \u2013 Ensure that calls returning collections (such as get_entities) are checked for None before iterating over them to prevent \u2018NoneType\u2019 errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Issues\n  \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab at Position(0.5, 2.5), confirm that a Lab entity is present in the inventory. Handling empty or missing retrieval results can avoid placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Dependency Shortages\n  \u2013 Lab crafting failures were due to missing sub-ingredients (iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable). Verify that production chains (smelting and intermediate crafting) reliably deliver all required components and that resource prerequisites are met before reattempting Lab production."}
