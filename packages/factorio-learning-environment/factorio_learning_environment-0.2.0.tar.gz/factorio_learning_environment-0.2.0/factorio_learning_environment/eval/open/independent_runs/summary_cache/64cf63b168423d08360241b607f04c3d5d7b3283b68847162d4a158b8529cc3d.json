{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) extracting coal.\n- Transport Belt network starting from position (x=41.5, y=-85.5) to (x=41.5, y=-81.5) facilitating coal transport.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) transferring coal from the belt into a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-81.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Belt Group Network\n- Multiple belt groups connecting various positions to facilitate the movement of resources across the map. Notable belt group positions include:\n  - Belt Group from (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Belt Group from (x=54.5, y=-86.5) to (x=52.5, y=-86.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Belt Group from (x=41.5, y=-85.5) to (x=41.5, y=-83.5), direction DOWN.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing is 10 units; ensure you are within this range to avoid placement errors."}
