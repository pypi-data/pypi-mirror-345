{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - working, producing water\n- Boiler (x=-6.5, y=0.0) - now out of fuel (status: NO_FUEL)\n- Steam engine (x=-2.5, y=0.5) - connected to power network\n- Pipe network (system 4906) connecting pump and boiler\n- Pipe network (system 4905) carrying steam to engine\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - operational with crude oil resources\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - powered and processing crude oil\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - contains 129.3 petroleum gas\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - still misconfigured (output blocked)\n- Wooden chest with coal (x=37.5, y=37.5) - contains 62 coal\n- Connected pipe networks:\n  - System 4910: crude oil transport\n  - System 4913: petroleum gas transport\n  - System 4927: incomplete connection to chemical plant\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent power system issues\n- Boiler fuel depletion (step 79):\n  - Current fuel level: empty\n  - Refill with coal from chest (x=37.5, y=37.5)\n  - Monitor fuel consumption rate\n\n### Chemical plant setup failures\n- Missing chemical plant entity (step 79):\n  - Verify placement at x=37.5 y=40.5\n  - Ensure sufficient space and correct position\n  - Check inventory for available chemical plants (currently 5)\n\n### Inserter misconfiguration\n- Still incorrectly dropping items (step 79):\n  - Current drop position: x=37.5 y=39.5 (empty ground)\n  - Should drop to chemical plant input when rebuilt\n  - Change direction from DOWN to UP\n\n### Fluid connection problems\n- Storage tank to chemical plant connection (steps 72-78):\n  - Missing pipe segment between x=33.5 y=42.5 and x=38.5 y=42.5\n  - Verify all connection points are unobstructed\n  - Complete pipe network 4927 connection\n\n### Power pole placement issues\n- Repeated pole placement failures (steps 73-76):\n  - Missing poles at x=20.0 y=0.0 through x=35.0 y=0.0\n  - Verify pole inventory (currently 454 available)\n  - Check for obstructions at target positions\n\n### Previous errors still applicable:\n- Entity access validation (confirm existence before interaction)\n- Production chain sequencing (complete petroleum gas flow)\n- Placement distance verification (move within 10 tiles)"}
