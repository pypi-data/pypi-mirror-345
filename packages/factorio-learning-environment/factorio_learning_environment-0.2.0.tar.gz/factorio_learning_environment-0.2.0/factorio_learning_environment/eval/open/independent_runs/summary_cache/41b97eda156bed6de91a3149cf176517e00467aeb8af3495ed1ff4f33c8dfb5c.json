{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with output full of iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Processing\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to move items from Stone Furnace to Wooden Chest\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple Pipe Groups at various positions, all currently empty, indicating potential fluid transport routes:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-42.5, -124.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-50.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-1.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-4.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with multiple small electric poles, currently not connected to the power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel machines like the burner mining drill. Regularly check and replenish fuel supplies to avoid disruptions.\n\n### Errors in Power Supply\n- Connect the inserter to a functioning power network to ensure it receives electricity. Check the connections and ensure that the power poles are correctly linked to the power source.\n\n### Errors with Full Output and No Ingredients\n- Regularly monitor and manage the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full. Ensure that there are adequate raw materials available for processing to avoid idle machines."}
