{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-11.5, 18.5)\n- Connected pipes that facilitate fluid transport\n\n### Boiler system at position(-21.5, 28.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position(-21.5, 28.0)\n- Connected pipes near the boiler at positions(-23.5, 26.5), (-23.5, 27.5), and connection points at (-23.5, 28.5) and (-19.5, 28.5)\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipes near the offshore pump\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Lab at position(unknown)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position(unknown) with missing science packs\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(unknown) and inserter at position(unknown) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position unknown) that connects the furnace at position(unknown) to assembling machine at position(unknown)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to access an offshore pump\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is placed correctly at the specified position before attempting to access it. The error indicates that there was no offshore pump found at the specified position (-23.5, 28.5).\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to boiler connections\n- Verify that pipes are correctly connected to the boiler and that there are no stale entities in the connection points."}
