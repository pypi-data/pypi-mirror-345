{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-2.5, y=24.0)\n- PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler with pipes at positions including (x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-6.5, y=23.5), ..., (x=-4.5, y=23.5), (x=-5.5, y=23.5), (x=-4.5, y=24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a warning status of \"no ingredients to smelt\" and containing 4 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a tile before attempting placement. Avoid placing entities on water or occupied tiles. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or reference position when placing entities like boilers.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- Avoid using unsupported operations between incompatible types, such as adding integers to 'ModelPrivateAttr'. Ensure variables are correctly defined and compatible for arithmetic operations.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Maintain sufficient inventory of required items before crafting or inserting into entities. For example, ensure you have coal before attempting to insert it into a boiler, and have iron plates before crafting pipes.\n\n### Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, define 'steam_engine' and 'steam_engine_buildable_area' before attempting to use them in operations.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities with pipes or other connectors. Ensure the correct entities are defined and available for connections.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Ensure you have the necessary crafting machines or smelting facilities available for crafting items that require them, such as iron plates."}
