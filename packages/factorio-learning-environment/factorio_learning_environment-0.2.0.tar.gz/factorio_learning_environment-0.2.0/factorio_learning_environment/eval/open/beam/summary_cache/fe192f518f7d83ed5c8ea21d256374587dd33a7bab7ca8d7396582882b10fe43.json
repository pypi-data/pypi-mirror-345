{"content": "Ah, I see the core issue now. We don't have any wooden chests in our inventory. Let's check what we actually have available first:\n\n# Check our current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory contents: {inventory}\")\n\n# Check what entities are already placed\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(\"\\nExisting entities:\")\nfor entity in entities:\n    print(f\"- {entity.name} at position {entity.position}\")\n\n# Get the mining drill specifically\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"\\nMining drill details:\")\nprint(f\"Position: {drill.position}\")\nprint(f\"Status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\n\nThis will help us understand:\n1. What items we actually have available to work with\n2. What entities are already placed in the world\n3. The exact position and status of our mining drill\n\nThen we can make a more informed decision about what to do next.", "summary_range": "[1-2688]"}
