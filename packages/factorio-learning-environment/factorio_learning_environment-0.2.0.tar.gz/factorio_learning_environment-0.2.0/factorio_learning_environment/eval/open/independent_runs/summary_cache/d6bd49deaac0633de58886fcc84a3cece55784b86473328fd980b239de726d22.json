{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5) extracting water (99.05 units)\n- Boiler at position(-5.0, 2.5) with 19 coal remaining (water: 199.80 units) - currently functioning\n- Steam engine at position(0.5, 6.5) - currently functioning with steam (36.08 units)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\n- Small electric pole connected to the steam engine at position(0.5, 8.5)\n\n### Crude Oil Production System at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5) extracting from crude oil patch (300,000 units remaining) - currently functioning\n- Small electric pole at position(15.5, 39.5) connected to the pumpjack\n- Three storage tanks in sequence:\n  - Storage tank 1 at position(23.5, 43.5)\n  - Storage tank 2 at position(29.5, 46.5)\n  - Storage tank 3 at position(35.5, 49.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the pumpjack to all three storage tanks in sequence\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nConsists of multiple small electric poles forming a power grid with ID 5054. The network is functioning properly with the steam engine generating electricity using coal in the boiler.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where terrain is unsuitable\n- When placing pumpjacks, ensure the target location is not on water or other unplaceable terrain\n- Check that the area is clear before attempting to place large entities\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent attributes or variables\n- Ensure variables are properly defined before referencing them (e.g., 'pumpjack2' was referenced before being defined)\n- Use the correct attribute names for entities (e.g., storage tanks use 'fluid_box' not 'fluid')\n\n### Errors when placing entities near existing structures\n- When placing inserters or other entities next to existing structures, ensure there is enough space\n- Increase spacing parameters when using placement functions near pipes or other entities\n- Consider the direction of placement and adjust accordingly to avoid collisions\n\n### Systematic approach to finding valid placement locations\n- When searching for valid placement locations, implement a more targeted search rather than trying many positions sequentially\n- Consider checking the terrain type before attempting to place entities\n\n### Errors when accessing list elements that don't exist\n- Always check if a list has elements before accessing them by index (e.g., `get_entities({Prototype.WoodenChest})[0]` caused an IndexError when no wooden chests were present)\n- Use conditional checks or try/except blocks when accessing potentially empty lists\n\n### Errors when inserting items that aren't in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities (like coal into a boiler), check if you have the required items in your inventory\n- Implement inventory checking before insertion operations to avoid \"No coal to insert from your inventory\" errors"}
