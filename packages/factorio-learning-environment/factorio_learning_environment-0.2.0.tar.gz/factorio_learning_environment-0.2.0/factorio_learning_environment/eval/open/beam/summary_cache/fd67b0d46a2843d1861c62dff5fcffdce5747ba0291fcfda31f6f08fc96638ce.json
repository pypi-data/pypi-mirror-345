{"content": "Ah, I understand the issue now. We can't craft a burner inserter directly because:\n1. It requires iron-gear-wheels\n2. Which requires iron-plates\n3. Which need to be smelted in a furnace\n\nLet's analyze what we have and what we need:\n\n```python\n# First check our current inventory and entities\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Get all entities to see what we're working with\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Available entities:\")\nfor entity in entities:\n    print(f\"- {entity.name} at {entity.position}\")\n\n# Check specifically for furnaces\nfurnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nprint(f\"\\nFound {len(furnaces)} furnaces\")\nfor furnace in furnaces:\n    print(f\"Furnace at {furnace.position} status: {furnace.status}\")\n    print(f\"Furnace inventory: source={furnace.furnace_source}, result={furnace.furnace_result}\")\n\n# Check for iron ore resources\niron_ore = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"\\nNearest iron ore at: {iron_ore}\")\n```\n\nThis will help us understand what we need to do to:\n1. Get iron ore\n2. Smelt it into iron plates\n3. Craft iron gear wheels\n4. Finally craft the burner inserter\n\nLet me know what resources and entities we have available and I'll help plan the next steps.", "summary_range": "[1-2816]"}
