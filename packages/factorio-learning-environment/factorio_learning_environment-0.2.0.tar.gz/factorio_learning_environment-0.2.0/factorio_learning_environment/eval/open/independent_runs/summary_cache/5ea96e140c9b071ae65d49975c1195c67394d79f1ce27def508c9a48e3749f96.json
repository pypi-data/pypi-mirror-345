{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nThis structure is designed for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest and burner inserter\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Contains iron ore (30 units)\n  - Status: Normal\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest, burner mining drill, and stone furnace\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and aligned to transfer items from the source (wooden chest) to the destination (stone furnace). Repeated repositioning indicates potential misalignment or incorrect setup.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is operational and has a clear path to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for any obstructions or misconfigurations that may prevent the transfer.\n\n### Errors with Full Chest\n- Regularly monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as the burner mining drill and burner inserter, are adequately refueled with coal to maintain continuous operation."}
