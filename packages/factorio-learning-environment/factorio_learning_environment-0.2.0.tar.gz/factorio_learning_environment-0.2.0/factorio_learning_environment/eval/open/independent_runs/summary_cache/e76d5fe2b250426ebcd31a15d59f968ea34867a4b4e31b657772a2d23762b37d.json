{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). These furnaces are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. They are currently not working due to a lack of ingredients and have full furnace results.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management for Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel the burner mining drill to prevent it from stopping due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Inventory Management for Chests\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from stopping due to a full chest.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Management\n- Ensure that there are enough ingredients (iron ore) in the furnaces to keep them operational and avoid warnings about no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Furnace Output Management\n- Regularly extract the smelted iron plates from the furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and stopping production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the quantities of different items in the agent's inventory.\n- `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus - Indicates the current status of the burner mining drill.\n- `furnace_status`: EntityStatus - Indicates the current status of the stone furnaces."}
