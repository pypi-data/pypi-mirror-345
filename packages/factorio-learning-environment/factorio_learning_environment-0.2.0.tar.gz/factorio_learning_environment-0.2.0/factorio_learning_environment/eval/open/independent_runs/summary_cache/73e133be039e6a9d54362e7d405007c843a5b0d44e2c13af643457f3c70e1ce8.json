{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Multiple wooden chests positioned at various locations for storing iron plates, some of which are full.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0) with coal fuel, extracting iron ore and depositing it into a chest.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) receiving iron ore from the mining drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and furnaces have a sufficient supply of coal to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors from Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent overflow and ensure continuous production and storage. Specifically, the chest at (4.5, -58.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: int - Represents the count of iron ore in the inventory.\n- `iron-plate`: int - Represents the count of iron plates in the inventory.\n- `coal`: int - Represents the count of coal available for fueling entities.\n- `wood`: int - Represents the count of wood in the inventory.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int - Represents the count of iron gear wheels in the inventory."}
