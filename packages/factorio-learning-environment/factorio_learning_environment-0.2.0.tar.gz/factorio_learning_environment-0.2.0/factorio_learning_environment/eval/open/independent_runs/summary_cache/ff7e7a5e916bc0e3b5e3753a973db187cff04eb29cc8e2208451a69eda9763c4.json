{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED and warnings 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) fueled with coal, with status FULL_OUTPUT.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) with status EMPTY.\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=-0.5, y=21.5) with status EMPTY.\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=2.5, y=21.5) with status EMPTY.\n- **PipeGroup** at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, carrying water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles at various positions including (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), (x=12.5, y=23.5), etc., with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and within the correct range. In step 3430, there was a failure to connect a pipe from the boiler's steam output point to the steam engine. Verify the connection points and ensure that the entities are correctly aligned and within reach.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connections\n- The steam engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) is not connected due to 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'. Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of steam, and that all necessary pipes are correctly placed and connected.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: Attempted to connect entities using pipes. Failed in step 3430 due to incorrect alignment or distance between entities.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **pipes**: List of pipe entities used for connecting various structures.\n- **boiler.steam_output_point**: Position from which the boiler outputs steam, used in connection attempts.\n- **steam_engine**: Reference to the steam engine entity, used in connection attempts."}
