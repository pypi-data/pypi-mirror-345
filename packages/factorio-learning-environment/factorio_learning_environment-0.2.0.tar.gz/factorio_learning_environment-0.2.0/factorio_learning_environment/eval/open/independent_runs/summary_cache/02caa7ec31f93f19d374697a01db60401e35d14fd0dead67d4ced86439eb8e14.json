{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 1.5) with a pickup position at (0.5, 1.5) and a drop position at (2.5, 1.5), connected to the stone furnaces.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 1.5) with a pickup position at (2.5, 1.5) and a drop position at (4.5, 1.5), connected to the stone furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inspecting non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to inspect it. Double-check the coordinates and confirm the entity's presence on the map.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Before using variables like `first_chest` and `second_chest`, ensure they are properly defined and initialized. This will prevent errors related to undefined variables during execution.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Verify that the placement of entities is successful by checking the inventory count before and after placement. If the count does not decrease, the placement might have failed."}
