Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Full Output Warnings\n- Regularly empty the output chests and furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which halts production. Implement a system to automatically transfer items from full entities to storage or processing units.\n\n### Ingredient Shortages\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to prevent stoppages due to lack of ingredients. Consider setting up automated transport systems to maintain a steady flow of materials.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the count of various items in the inventory, such as 'wooden-chest', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
