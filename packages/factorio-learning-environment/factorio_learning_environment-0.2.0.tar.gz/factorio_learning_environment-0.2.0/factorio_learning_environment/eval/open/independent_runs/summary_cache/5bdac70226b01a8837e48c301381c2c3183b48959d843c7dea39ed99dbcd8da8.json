{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently working with fuel: {'coal': 2} and smelting {'iron-ore': 19}.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest. Pickup position: (0.5, 0.5), Drop position: (2.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates. Current inventory: {'iron-plate': 19}.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) transferring items from the wooden chest to a transport belt. Pickup position: (2.5, 0.5), Drop position: (4.5, 0.5).\n- **Transport Belt Group** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5) facilitating the movement of iron plates. Consists of 2 belts.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to an end wooden chest. Pickup position: (5.5, 0.5), Drop position: (7.5, 0.5).\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt. Current inventory: {'iron-plate': 17}.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Ensure there is enough space and no other entities at the desired position before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting spacing or changing the direction if placement fails due to an existing entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from chests\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a transport belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors due to missing inventory items\n- Ensure all required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, gather raw resources like wood before crafting items like wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required raw resources\n- Gather necessary raw resources before crafting items that require them. For instance, wood must be gathered manually as it cannot be crafted."}
