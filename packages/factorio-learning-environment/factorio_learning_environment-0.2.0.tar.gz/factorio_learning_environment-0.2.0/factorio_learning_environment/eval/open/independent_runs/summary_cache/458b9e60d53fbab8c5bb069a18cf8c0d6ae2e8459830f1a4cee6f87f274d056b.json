{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5)\n\n### Coal Supply at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5)\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting into the Stone Furnace\n- The Stone Furnace is reporting that its result is full. Ensure that the output inventory is cleared before inserting more items.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into the Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the Burner Mining Drill. If you run out of coal, the drill will stop working.\n\n### Errors when the Burner Mining Drill has no fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of your Burner Mining Drill and ensure it has enough fuel to operate.\n\n### Errors when the chest at drop position is full\n- Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining with the Burner Mining Drill at (-15.0, -50.0).\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Invoked multiple times for inserting coal into the Burner Mining Drill and Stone Furnace. Failed due to insufficient coal in inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_coal`: int\n- `burner_mining_drill_2`: BurnerMiningDrill\n- `quantity`: int\n- `furnace_source`: Inventory\n- `furnace_result`: Inventory"}
