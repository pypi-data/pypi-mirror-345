{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest steps. All placement attempts have failed due to various constraints or issues, resulting in no entities being placed on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to global constraints\n- Ensure that there are no global constraints affecting the placement of entities. Review the map settings and constraints before attempting to place entities.\n\n### Errors due to hidden constraints\n- Investigate any hidden constraints that may prevent the placement of entities. Consider checking for overlapping zones or invisible barriers.\n\n### Errors due to persistent placement issues\n- Confirm that persistent issues are not affecting the placement of entities. This may involve checking for consistent errors across different locations and types of entities.\n\n### Errors due to map-wide restrictions\n- Verify that map-wide restrictions are not preventing entity placement. This may involve reviewing the map's overall settings and ensuring that placement is allowed in the intended areas.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect data types\n- Ensure that the correct data types are used when interacting with the game API. For example, use integer indices where required, rather than strings or other data types.\n\n### Errors due to cross-type placement issues\n- Check for issues related to placing different types of entities in close proximity. Ensure that the placement rules for each entity type are respected.\n\n### Errors due to potential map issues\n- Investigate any potential map issues that may be causing placement failures. This could involve checking for terrain irregularities or other map-specific factors that could impede placement."}
