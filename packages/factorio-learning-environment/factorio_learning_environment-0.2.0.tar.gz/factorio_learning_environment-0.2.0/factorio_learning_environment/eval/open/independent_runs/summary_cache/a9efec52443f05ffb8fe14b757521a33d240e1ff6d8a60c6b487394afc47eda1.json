{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore (output blocked at belt 15.5,72.5)\n- **Burner inserter** at (17.5, 72.5) moving ore (output blocked)\n- **Transport belt network** connecting drill to furnace (blocked at 15.5,72.5)\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 74.0) for smelting (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-47.5, 74.5) for storage\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) extracting copper ore (working)\n- **Burner inserter** at (-48.5, 72.5) waiting for source items\n- **Transport belt network** connecting drill to furnace\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 74.0) for smelting (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-46.5, 74.5) for storage\n\n#### Power Generation Setup at (-21.5, 70.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-21.5, 70.5) supplying water (working)\n- **Boiler** at (-25.0, 80.5) converting water to steam (fueled)\n- **Steam engine** at (-25.5, 89.5) generating power (working)\n- **Pipe network** connecting components (fluid system 606 for water, 609 for steam)\n\n#### New Storage Area at (28.5, 74.5)\n- **Wooden chest** at (28.5, 74.5)\n- **Burner inserter** at (27.5, 74.5) waiting for source items\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Placement Collisions (6 instances)\n- Clear existing entities before placing new ones (wooden chest at -46.5,74.5, burner inserters at multiple positions)\n- Increase spacing when placing near existing entities (failed placements at spacing=0/1)\n- Verify target position is clear using `get_entities_at()` before placement\n\n#### Inserter Operation Issues (4 instances)\n- Ensure inserters have:\n  - Clear pickup/drop positions (blocked at 17.5,72.5)\n  - Available source items (waiting at -48.5,72.5)\n  - Fuel supply (multiple furnaces out of fuel)\n- Connect inserters to valid input/output entities\n\n#### Throughput Blockages (3 instances)\n- Clear backed-up transport belts (iron belt at 15.5,72.5 has 46 ore)\n- Expand storage capacity when chests fill\n- Maintain balanced production/consumption ratios\n\n#### Entity Interaction Errors (2 instances)\n- Verify entity exists and contains items before extraction attempts\n- Check entity status before interaction (WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION etc.)\n\n#### Power System Maintenance\n- Monitor fuel levels in boilers/furnaces\n- Address warnings about blocked outputs promptly\n- Ensure power coverage for all electrical entities\n\n#### Belt Connection Logic\n- Use intermediate inserters between belts and furnaces\n- Verify belt directions form continuous paths\n- Clear debris from belt paths"}
