{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\nThe agent has created the following structures on the map:\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (39.5, -79.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -78.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (60.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone furnace at position (60.0, -60.0)\n\n### Electricity generator at position (106.5, -32.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (106.5, -32.5)\n- Boiler at position (111.5, -32.0)\n- Steam engine at position (117.5, -30.5)\n- Pipe group at position (107.5, -34.5)\n- Pipe group at position (105.5, -32.5)\n- Electricity group at position (114.5, -28.666666666666668)\n\n### Transport system at position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt group at position (40.5, -83.5)\n- Transport belt at position (63.5, -53.5)\n- Transport belt at position (64.5, -53.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\nThe agent has encountered the following errors:\n\n* **No fuel**: The burner mining drill, stone furnace, and burner inserter are not functioning due to a lack of fuel. To mitigate this, ensure that these entities have a sufficient fuel supply.\n* **No ingredients**: The stone furnace at position (60.0, -60.0) is not functioning due to a lack of ingredients. To mitigate this, ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate.\n* **Not connected**: The steam engine at position (117.5, -30.5) is not functioning because it is not connected to a power source. To mitigate this, connect the steam engine to a power source, such as a boiler.\n* **Not plugged into electric network**: The electricity group at position (114.5, -28.666666666666668) is not functioning because it is not plugged into an electric network. To mitigate this, connect the electricity group to an electric network.\n* **Empty**: The pipe group at position (107.5, -34.5) and the belt group at position (40.5, -83.5) are empty. To mitigate this, ensure that these entities have a sufficient supply of items to transport.\n* **Waiting for source items**: The burner inserter at position (39.5, -79.5) is waiting for source items. To mitigate this, ensure that the inserter has a sufficient supply of items to insert.\n\n# NAMESPACE\nThe agent has defined the following utility functions:\n\n* None\n\nThe agent has assigned the following variables:\n\n* None \n\nNote: The report only includes information from the provided execution logs and may not be comprehensive."}
