{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates\n\n### Laboratory Setup\n- Lab at Position (7.5, -61.5) connected to the power network\n\n### Inserter Setup\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the power network but not receiving electricity\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the power network. Verify that the electricity poles are correctly placed and connected to the power source.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and the rest of the power network. Ensure that there is a continuous flow of steam from the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Check the power connections to the inserter. Ensure that the inserter is within the coverage area of a powered electric pole and that the pole is connected to an active power source.\n\n### Boiler Output Blockage\n- Ensure that the boiler's steam output is not blocked. Check for any obstructions or incorrect connections that may prevent steam from flowing to the steam engine.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the burner mining drill to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full to avoid interruptions in mining."}
