{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup (position -9.5, -6.5) with fluid system 14953\n- PipeGroup (position -4.5, 19.5) with fluid system 14960 (full output)\n- PipeGroup (position -15.5, 23.5) with fluid system 14961 (empty)\n- PipeGroup (position -18.5, 25.5) with fluid system 14967 (empty)\n- PipeGroup (position -21.5, 28.5) with fluid system 14971 (empty)\n- PipeGroup (position -20.5, 29.5) with fluid system 14970 (empty)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to pick up entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to pick up exists at the specified position. Double-check the coordinates before executing the pickup command.\n\n### Errors when placing new electric poles\n- Make sure to check if the target position for the new electric pole is valid and not occupied by another entity. \n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Always define your variables before using them in commands. In this case, ensure that 'new_pole' is properly initialized before trying to connect it to other entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are within range and that you have the correct references to their positions."}
