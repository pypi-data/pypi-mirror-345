{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these components, including pipes at positions such as (-47.5, -122.5) and (-43.5, -118.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (-44.5, -119.5), (-43.5, -117.5), and (-39.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Small Electric Poles nearby to support electricity distribution\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered\n- Multiple PipeGroups across various positions, such as (-50.5, -122.5) and (-1.5, 11.5), indicating fluid transport networks\n- Electricity Group with poles spanning positions like (3.5, -60.5) to (12.5, -52.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before attempting to place a pipe. This can be verified by checking the target location for obstructions.\n\n### Errors When Removing Entities\n- The first argument in the removal function must be an Entity or Prototype object. Ensure that the correct object type is being passed to the function.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to a power network and receiving the necessary input liquid. Check for any warnings or status indicators on the generator and connected components.\n\n### Connection Errors with Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure that the small electric poles are correctly positioned and connected to the intended entities. Verify the connection points and ensure there are no nil values or other issues preventing successful connections."}
