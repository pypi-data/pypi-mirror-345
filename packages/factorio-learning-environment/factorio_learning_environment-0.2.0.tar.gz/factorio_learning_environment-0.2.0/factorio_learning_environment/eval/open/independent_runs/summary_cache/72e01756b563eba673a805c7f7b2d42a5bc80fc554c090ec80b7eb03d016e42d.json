{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of 12 coal and a furnace result inventory containing 13 iron plates. The furnace is currently not operational due to a lack of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with no fluid present in connections, indicating it is not yet connected to a fluid system.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of 10 automation science packs, currently not operational due to lack of power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Incorrect Entities\n- Ensure that the target entity from which you want to extract items contains the desired resource. For example, attempting to extract iron ore from a stone furnace will fail if the furnace does not contain iron ore.\n\n### Errors when Inserting into Full Inventories\n- Check the inventory capacity of the target entity before attempting to insert items. Inserting items into a stone furnace with a full inventory will result in failure.\n\n### Errors when Crafting Unavailable Recipes\n- Verify that the required technology is researched before attempting to craft items. For instance, crafting a solar panel requires the solar-energy technology to be researched first.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities without Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. Placing an offshore pump without having it in the inventory will not succeed.\n\n### Errors in Using Unsupported Operations\n- Avoid using unsupported operations with data types. For example, adding an integer to a 'ModelPrivateAttr' type will result in a TypeError. Ensure that all operations are compatible with the data types involved.\n\n### Errors in Accessing Non-Existent Attributes\n- Confirm that the attributes you are trying to access exist for the entity. Accessing a non-existent attribute like 'tile_dimensions' on an entity class will lead to an AttributeError."}
