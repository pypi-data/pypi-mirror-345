{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting various components at positions (-4.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Small Electric Poles placed at positions (-8.5, 22.5), (-8.5, 21.5), (-8.5, 20.5), (-8.5, 19.5), (-8.5, 18.5), (-8.5, 17.5), (-8.5, 16.5), and (-6.5, 16.5) to connect the electricity network\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing or connecting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have enough small electric poles in your inventory before attempting to place or connect them. Gather necessary resources like wood and copper plates to craft more poles if needed.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient materials for crafting\n- Check your inventory for required materials before crafting. Ensure you have the necessary raw resources or intermediate products, such as copper plates for crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Verify that the entity contains the items you intend to extract. Ensure that the stone furnace has the required output before attempting to extract items like copper plates.\n\n### Errors related to fuel and connectivity\n- Regularly check the fuel status of boilers and ensure they are fueled to maintain operation. Also, ensure that all components of the electricity network are properly connected to avoid disruptions in power supply."}
