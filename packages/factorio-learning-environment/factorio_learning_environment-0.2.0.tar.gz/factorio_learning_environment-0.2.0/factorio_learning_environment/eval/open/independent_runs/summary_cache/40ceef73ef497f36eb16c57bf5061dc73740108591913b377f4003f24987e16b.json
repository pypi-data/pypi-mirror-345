{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity generator at position(-5.5, 3.5)\nConsists of offshore pump(position -9.5, -0.5), boiler(position -5.5, 0.0) and steam engine(position -5.5, 3.5)\n\n#### Crude oil processing factory at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of pumpjack(position 17.5, 40.5), oil refinery(position 22.5, 40.5) and associated pipes\n\n#### Lubricant factory at position(27.5, 40.5)\nConsists of chemical plant(position 27.5, 40.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied positions:\n  - Ensure the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n  - Example: Error in Step 4 when trying to place a steam engine at (-4.0, 0.0) due to an existing object in the way.\n\n* Errors when using undefined recipe names:\n  - Verify that the recipe name used is valid and correctly spelled.\n  - Example: Error in Step 6 when trying to set the chemical plant recipe to \"Lubricant\" due to an AttributeError.\n\n* Errors when connecting entities with incompatible fluid requirements:\n  - Ensure that the fluid output of the source entity matches the fluid input required by the target entity's recipe.\n  - Example: Error in Step 7 when trying to connect the oil refinery to the chemical plant due to a mismatch in fluid requirements.\n\n* Errors due to unconnected power networks:\n  - Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a power source.\n  - Example: Warnings in Step 7 for pumpjack, oil refinery, and chemical plant due to not being connected to a power network or not receiving electricity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n* `place_entity(entity_type, position)`: Places an entity of the given type at the specified position. \n  - Failure modes: \n    - Attempting to place an entity at a position that is already occupied.\n    - Using an invalid or undefined entity type.\n  - Success mode: Entity is successfully placed at the specified position.\n\n* `set_entity_recipe(entity, recipe_name)`: Sets the recipe for the given entity.\n  - Failure modes: \n    - Using an invalid or undefined recipe name.\n  - Success mode: Recipe is successfully set for the entity.\n\n* `connect_entities(source_entity, target_entity, connection_type)`: Connects two entities using the specified connection type (e.g., pipes or power poles).\n  - Failure modes: \n    - Entities are not compatible for the specified connection type.\n    - Fluid output of the source entity does not match the fluid input required by the target entity.\n  - Success mode: Entities are successfully connected.\n\nImportant variables:\n- `boiler_pos`: Position(x, y) of the boiler entity.\n- `steam_engine_pos`: Position(x, y) of the steam engine entity.\n- `oil_refinery`: Entity object representing the oil refinery.\n- `chemical_plant`: Entity object representing the chemical plant."}
