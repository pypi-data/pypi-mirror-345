{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Connected to power grid via small electric poles\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Operation at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) extracting copper ore\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 73.0) smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Connected to power grid via small electric poles\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (15.5, -0.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, -0.5) extracting coal\n- **Wooden chest** at (15.5, 1.5) storing coal (note: was removed in step 15)\n- Connected to power grid via small electric poles\n\n#### Stone Mining Operation at (-46.5, -0.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, -0.5) extracting stone\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 3.0) smelting stone (currently not operational)\n- Connected to power grid via small electric poles\n\n#### Power Generation System at (-9.5, -1.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -1.5) providing water\n- **Boiler** at (-5.0, 1.5) converting water to steam\n- **Steam engine** at (0.5, 5.5) generating electricity\n- Connected via pipe network for fluid transfer:\n  - Water pipes from (-8.5, -1.5) to (-5.5, -1.5)\n  - Steam pipes from (-6.5, 1.5) to (-3.5, 5.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Fluid System Connection Issues\n- Failed to connect boiler to steam engine due to blocked connection points. Verify all pipe connections are clear and properly aligned.\n- Multiple \"NOT_CONNECTED\" statuses on boiler and steam engine despite pipe connections. Double-check fluid flow direction and connection points.\n\n#### Entity Access Errors\n- Repeated attempts to access non-existent wooden chest at (15.5, 1.5). Verify entity existence before access attempts.\n- Multiple failed attempts to clear blocking items at (-46.5, 1.5). Ensure proper position coordinates and entity detection.\n\n#### Power Grid Problems\n- Mining drills show intermittent \"NO_POWER\" status despite connections. Verify all power poles are properly chained.\n- Steam engine shows \"NOT_CONNECTED\" to power network despite connection attempts. Check power pole placement and connections.\n\n#### Operational Warnings\n- Multiple drills show \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\". Ensure output containers have available space.\n- Boiler shows \"NOT_CONNECTED\" status despite water pipes. Verify water supply reaches boiler input.\n\n#### Placement Issues\n- Repeated stone furnace placement failures at (-46.5, 1.5). Clear area completely before placement attempts.\n- Entity removal attempts failing at occupied positions. Use proper pickup/removal commands for existing entities."}
