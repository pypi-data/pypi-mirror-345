{"content": "Ah, now I understand the core issue. We can't craft iron gear wheels directly because they require iron plates, and iron plates must be smelted in a furnace. Let's use our existing furnace to make iron plates first:\n\n1. Find an existing furnace\n2. Use it to smelt iron ore into plates\n3. Then we can craft iron gear wheels\n4. Finally craft the burner inserter\n\n```python\n# Check our current setup\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Find an existing furnace\nfurnaces = [e for e in get_entities() if isinstance(e, Furnace)]\nif furnaces:\n    working_furnace = furnaces[0]\n    print(f\"Found furnace at {working_furnace.position}\")\n    \n    # Move to furnace and add fuel if needed\n    move_to(working_furnace.position)\n    if working_furnace.status == \"NO_FUEL\":\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, working_furnace, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n    \n    # Get iron ore from chest\n    chest = get_entity(Prototype.IronChest, Position(x=-15.5, y=21.5))\n    if chest and chest.inventory.get('iron-ore', 0) > 0:\n        # Insert iron ore into furnace\n        move_to(working_furnace.position)\n        insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, working_furnace, quantity=10)\n        print(\"Added iron ore to furnace\")\n        \n        # Wait for smelting\n        print(\"Waiting for iron plates...\")\n        sleep(5)\n        \n        # Now we should have iron plates to craft with\n        inventory = inspect_inventory()\n        print(f\"Updated inventory: {inventory}\")\n        \n        if inventory.get('iron-plate', 0) >= 2:\n            # Craft iron gear wheel\n            craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 1)\n            print(\"Crafted iron gear wheel\")\n            \n            # Now craft burner inserter\n            craft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter, 1)\n            print(\"Crafted burner inserter\")\n            \n            # Verify we have what we need\n            inventory = inspect_inventory()\n            print(f\"Final inventory: {inventory}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Not enough iron plates produced yet\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No iron ore available in chest\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No furnace found\")\n```\n\nThis should help us get the iron plates we need to craft the other items. Let me know if this works and we can continue with setting up the automation.", "summary_range": "[1-1408]"}
