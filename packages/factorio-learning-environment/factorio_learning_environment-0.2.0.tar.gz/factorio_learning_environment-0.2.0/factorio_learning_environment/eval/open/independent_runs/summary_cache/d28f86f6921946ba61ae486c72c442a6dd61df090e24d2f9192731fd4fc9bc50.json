{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 16-23)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler (position -5.0, 2.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine (position 0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected with pipes forming two pipe groups (water and steam systems)\n- Small electric pole (position 3.5, 6.5) connecting to power network\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position 15.5, 70.5) facing down\n- Wooden chest (position 15.5, 73.5) collecting iron ore (currently contains 11 ore)\n- Stone furnace (position 18.0, 74.0) with coal fuel\n- Burner inserter (position 16.5, 73.5) transferring ore to furnace\n- Burner inserter (position 19.5, 73.5) transferring plates to output chest\n- Wooden chest (position 20.5, 73.5) for plate output (currently contains 5 plates)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent distance-related placement errors\n- Repeated attempts to place entities (electric mining drill, burner inserter) while too far away (positions 15.5,70.5 and 16.5,73.5)\n- Solution: Always move to target area before attempting placements (max distance is 10 tiles)\n\n### Entity collision placement errors\n- Failed to place stone furnace at (41.0, 73.5) due to existing entity\n- Failed to place small electric pole at (16.5, 71.5) due to obstruction\n- Solution: Clear target positions completely before placement attempts\n\n### Mining drill operation issues\n- Drill at (15.5,70.5) shows \"output blocked\" warning\n- Assertion error checking drill.status == WORKING\n- Solution: Ensure clear output path and proper power connection\n\n### Inserter operation problems\n- Burner inserter at (16.5,73.5) shows \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked\"\n- Solution: Verify clear path between inserter drop positions and target inventories\n\n### General recommendations\n- Verify all placed entities have required connections (power, input/output paths)\n- Check fuel levels in burner entities regularly\n- Monitor chest capacities to prevent output blockages\n- Double-check entity orientations before placement"}
