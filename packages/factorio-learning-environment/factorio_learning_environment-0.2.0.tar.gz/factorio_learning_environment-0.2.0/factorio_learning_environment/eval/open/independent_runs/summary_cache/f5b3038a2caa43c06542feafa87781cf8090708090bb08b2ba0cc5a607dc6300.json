{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-4.5, 14.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 14.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Various steam and water pipes connecting these components\n- Small electric pole at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Wooden chest for fuel storage at (-4.5, 25.5)\n\n### Manufacturing Area\n1. Inserter Production Line:\n- Assembling machine-1 at (23.5, 2.5)\n- Input chest at (20.5, 2.5) containing 36 inserters\n- Output chest at (26.5, 2.5)\n- Two burner inserters at (21.5, 2.5) and (25.5, 2.5)\n- Small electric pole at (23.5, 0.5)\n\n2. Smelting Area:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and iron plate output\n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0) with coal fuel\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n3. Science Pack Production:\n- Assembling machine-1 at (32.5, 5.5) for logistic science pack production\n- Multiple labs spread across the map with various science pack inputs\n- Small electric pole at (30.5, 7.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Pipe Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear of other entities before placing pipes\n- Check if terrain is suitable for pipe placement (avoid water tiles)\n- Remove existing entities that block pipe connections before attempting to place new ones\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Verify coal availability in inventory before attempting to insert into boilers\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner inserters and boilers\n\n### Entity Connection Errors\n- Steam engines require proper fluid connections to both input and output\n- Ensure continuous pipe connections between boiler and steam engine\n- Verify water supply connection from offshore pump to boiler\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- ElectricityGroup object does not have a voltage attribute - use correct attributes for checking electrical network status\n\n### Entity Placement Strategy\n- When rebuilding systems, completely remove old entities before placing new ones\n- Use underground pipes to avoid terrain obstacles and reduce space usage\n- Consider offset routes when direct paths are blocked"}
