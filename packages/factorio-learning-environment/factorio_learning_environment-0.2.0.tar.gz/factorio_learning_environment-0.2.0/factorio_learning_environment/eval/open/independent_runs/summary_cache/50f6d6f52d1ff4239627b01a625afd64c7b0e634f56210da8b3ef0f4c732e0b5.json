{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). The drill is currently out of fuel and its drop position chest is full.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (-14.5, -50.5) for storage purposes.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and producing iron plates. Currently, there are no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and producing iron plates. Currently, there are no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and producing iron plates. Currently, there are no ingredients to smelt, and the furnace fuel source is full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that all Burner Mining Drills are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have a continuous supply of smeltable ingredients to maintain production efficiency.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `final_inventory: dict` - Tracks the final inventory state, currently holding items such as 'wooden-chest', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
