{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, operational but output inventory often full.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) receiving iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), fueled and operational, feeding chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Newly placed transport belt at furnace output position (18.0, 76.0).\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 75.5) feeding assembling machine, placed and fueled.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt remains unresolved, limiting throughput.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged iron plate storage with partial belt integration but suffers from output congestion.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal and operational.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (0.5, 6.5).\n- Coal inserted into boiler and power generation stable.\n\nThis structure reliably produces electricity for the factory\u2019s network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered, but input inventory remains empty.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), empty.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5), (22.5, 75.5), and (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational, moving items between chests and assembler.\n- Newly placed burner inserter at (22.5, 75.5) feeding assembler.\n- Assembling machine unable to craft iron gear wheels due to lack of iron plate input.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and inserter feeding, but iron plate supply to the assembler is still missing.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Multiple failures placing small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) and steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to existing entities blocking placement.\n- Attempts to place burner inserter next to input chest at (21.5, 75.5) failed because of existing inserters occupying tiles.\n- To avoid these errors, always check tile occupancy before placement, increase spacing, change direction, or select alternate nearby positions.\n\n### Incorrect connection of transport belts to chests\n- Error when connecting transport belts directly to wooden chests at (21.5, 75.5); belts cannot connect directly to chests.\n- Solution: Use inserters between belts and chests to move items instead of direct belt-to-chest connections.\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace output belt\n- Furnace output belt at (18.0, 76.0) remains blocked, causing mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) to wait for space.\n- Output inventory of furnace often full, limiting throughput.\n- To fix, extend or clear output belts and ensure chests or inserters downstream have capacity to accept items.\n\n### Assembling machine input shortages\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) reports missing iron plates despite chests nearby containing iron plates.\n- Input chest at (21.5, 75.5) frequently emptied and refilled but assembler input inventory remains empty.\n- Ensure inserters properly feed iron plates from chests into assembler input; verify inserter placement and operation.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at multiple positions consistently fueled and operational.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel and source inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo new agent-defined functions detected in the recent steps."}
