Multiple attempts were made to locate, place, or craft the Lab at this position, but none succeeded due to inventory and resource shortfalls.\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\nUsed to convert iron ore and coal into iron plates. This furnace was retrieved from the map and employed to boost the overall iron-plate count as part of the efforts to enable Lab crafting.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at position (-27.0, -60.0)\nUtilized for smelting copper ore along with coal into copper plates. The increased copper-plate output was a critical component to support copper cable production, which is an essential sub-ingredient in Lab crafting.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n  - Avoid providing unsupported arguments to the get_entities function. For example, using a keyword (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or incorrect positional arguments leads to function signature mismatches.\n  - When a function call may return None, ensure you check the output (or provide a default empty list) before iterating over it.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n  - Verify that the Lab is available in the inventory before attempting to place it; placement errors occur when the required Lab entity is absent.\n  - Confirm that all sub-ingredients needed for Lab crafting (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are not only present but also craftable. Address resource shortages and production dependencies ahead of crafting attempts.\n  - Review the entire ingredient supply chain to ensure that once resource production is increased (via smelting or harvesting), the additional materials are sufficient to meet the Lab\u2019s crafting recipe.\n\n\u2022 General Error Handling\n  - Incorporate checks for entity validity when retrieving map objects to prevent operations on NoneType values.\n  - Prior to performing crafting operations, cross-check resource counts and production prerequisites to minimize repeated failures in structure placement or crafting."}
