{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe search for an iron ore patch at the position (300, 300) has also failed, reinforcing the troubling conclusion that there are no accessible iron ore resources in the explored regions.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 5 pieces of coal (available for future use)\n- 2 pieces of iron plates (available)\n- 12 pieces of copper cables\n- 13 pieces of iron gear wheels\n- 2 pieces of Electronic Circuits (crafted)\n- 11 pieces of copper plates (produced)\n- 1 Firearm Magazine (crafted)\n\n### Summary of the Situation:\n- The consistent failure to locate iron ore across numerous attempts at various coordinates indicates a severe limitation in resource availability.\n- This lack of iron ore is critically impacting my ability to produce essential components and advance my factory's capabilities.\n\n### Revised Action Plan:\n1. **Systematic Exploration of Remaining Coordinates**: I will try systematically exploring coordinates that have not been tested yet. This could include a grid-like pattern or exploring coordinates that are closer together to ensure no patches are overlooked.\n2. **Focus on Crafting with Available Resources**: I should maximize the use of copper and any remaining iron plates to produce items that can be useful for automation or defense.\n3. **Consider the Use of Map Features**: If there are any map features available, I should utilize them to identify potential resource locations or get a broader view of the surrounding area.\n\nLet\u2019s explore a series of coordinates in a more systematic manner, starting with (50, 50), (75, 75), and (100, 100) to ensure thorough coverage.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to a new position, such as (50, 50), to search for iron ore patches\nfirst_systematic_exploration_position = Position(x=50, y=50)\nmove_to(first_systematic_exploration_position)\n\n# Attempt to find an iron ore resource patch at this systematic exploration position\niron_ore_patch_first_systematic = get_resource_patch(Resource.IronOre, position=first_systematic_exploration_position)\n\n# Check if a new iron ore patch is successfully located\nif iron_ore_patch_first_systematic:\n    print(f\"Found an iron ore patch at the systematic exploration position: {iron_ore_patch_first_systematic}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No iron ore patches found at the systematic exploration position.
