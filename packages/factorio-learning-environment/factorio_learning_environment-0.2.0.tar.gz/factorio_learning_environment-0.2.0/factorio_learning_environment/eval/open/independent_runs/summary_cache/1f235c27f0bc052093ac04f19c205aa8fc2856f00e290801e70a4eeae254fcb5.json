{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll provide a structured report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Around x=9.5, y=19.5)\n- Steam engine at (x=9.5, y=19.5)\n- Boiler at (x=-2.0, y=23.5) with coal fuel\n- Offshore pump at (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Complex pipe network connecting these components:\n  - Water input pipes from offshore pump to boiler\n  - Steam output pipes from boiler attempting to connect to steam engine\n- Status: Not fully operational (steam engine not receiving steam/power)\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (Around x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) containing 392 iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (x=-14.0, y=-47.0) for smelting iron plates\n\n### Additional Smelting Array\nMultiple stone furnaces for iron smelting:\n- Furnaces at (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- Furnaces at (x=4.0, y=4.0), (x=6.0, y=4.0)\nAll furnaces have coal fuel but currently idle\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production (Around x=24.5, y=4.5)\n- Assembling machine at (x=24.5, y=4.5)\n- Input chest at (x=21.5, y=4.5) containing 770 iron plates\n- Output chest at (x=27.5, y=4.5) containing 430 copper plates and 16 science packs\n- Two burner inserters managing material flow:\n  - Input inserter at (x=22.5, y=4.5)\n  - Output inserter at (x=26.5, y=4.5)\n\n### Research Setup\nMultiple labs positioned across the map, currently unpowered but configured for automation research\n- Some labs contain automation science packs (one has 5 packs, another has 25 packs)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Steam/Power System Connection Issues\n- Ensure proper pipe connections between boiler and steam engine\n- Check steam engine orientation matches the steam flow direction\n- Verify no gaps in the pipe network between components\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a location\n- Remove conflicting entities before attempting to place new ones\n- Ensure enough clearance around large entities like steam engines\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Connect steam engines to power poles\n- Ensure power poles are properly connected to form a complete network\n- All powered entities need to be within range of power poles\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Use correct class names in code (ElectricityPole vs electricity_group)\n- Verify entity existence before attempting modifications\n- Check inventory contents before attempting insertions"}
