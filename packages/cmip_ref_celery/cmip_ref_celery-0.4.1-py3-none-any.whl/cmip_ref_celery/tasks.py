"""
Task generation and registration for Celery

This module provides a factory function to create Celery tasks for metrics.
These celery tasks are then registered with the Celery app to enable them to be run asynchronously.

Since the metric definition may be in a different virtual environment it is not possible to directly
import the provider and create the tasks in both the worker and the main process.

Instead, the tasks are registered only in the worker process.
The main process can then send tasks to the worker using the task name.
The main process is responsible for tracking what metrics have been registered
and to respond to new workers coming online.
