{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and outputs to a nearby position.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5): Collects iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5): Transfers iron plates from the furnace to another location.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is no existing object at the target location before placing a new entity. If an object is in the way, remove it first or choose a different location.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventories\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to inspect exists at the specified coordinates. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity is present.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Make sure you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. Check your inventory for the necessary items.\n\n### Errors when entities are not functioning\n- Ensure that all entities, such as mining drills and inserters, are properly fueled. Regularly refuel them to maintain their operation.\n- Check that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. If not, ensure the inserters are correctly positioned and functioning to supply the furnace with resources."}
