{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Station at (-14.0, -15.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) containing 112 coal\nCurrently out of fuel and not operational\n\n###Iron Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0) with 1 coal as fuel\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) containing 576 iron ore\nCurrently operational and mining iron ore\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Complex at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of following components:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) for copper ore (currently out of fuel)\n- Input chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n- Middle chest at (22.5, 21.5) containing 384 copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0) with 50 coal as fuel\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Transport system:\n  * Burner inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving items from input chest to middle chest\n  * Burner inserter at (23.5, 21.5) moving items from middle chest to furnace\n  * Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving finished plates to output chest\n\n###Unused Furnace Complex at (-10.0, 20.0)\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\n- Both contain 23 coal as fuel but are currently not operational due to lack of ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Furnace Fuel Management Issues\n- Monitor furnace fuel capacity before attempting to insert more fuel\n- Check if furnace is already at maximum fuel capacity (50/50) before attempting to add more coal\n\n###Inserter Placement and Configuration\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended source and destination entities\n- Ensure inserters are properly oriented to facilitate material movement between connected structures\n\n###Resource Management\n- Keep mining drills fueled to maintain continuous operation\n- Monitor chest inventory levels to prevent overflow or shortage of materials\n\n###Entity Positioning\n- Double-check entity positions before placement to ensure proper alignment with other components\n- Maintain proper spacing between entities to allow for inserter operations"}
