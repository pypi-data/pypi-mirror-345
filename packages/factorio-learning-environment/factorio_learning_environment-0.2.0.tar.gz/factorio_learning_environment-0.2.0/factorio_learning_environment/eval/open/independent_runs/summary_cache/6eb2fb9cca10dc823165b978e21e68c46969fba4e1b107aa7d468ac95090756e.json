{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, status: WORKING.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore, currently contains 130 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace, status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, currently not receiving iron ore, inventory contains 2 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5), aligned to transfer coal to the stone furnace, status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserters\n- Ensure inserters are correctly aligned with both pickup and drop positions. Misalignment can prevent items from being transferred correctly.\n\n### Inserter Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to maintain operational status. Lack of fuel will cause inserters to stop functioning.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter setup allows for the transfer of raw materials to the furnace. Ensure that the inserter is positioned correctly and has a clear path to transfer items.\n\n### Inserter Status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n- This status indicates that the inserter is waiting for items to be available at its pickup position. Ensure that the source of items is operational and supplying the necessary resources.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary raw materials for smelting. Check the inserter alignment and the supply of raw materials."}
