The transport belt is transporting the coal away from the mine. The drill is waiting for space in destination, and the inserter is working.\n\n### Coal storage near coal mine\nConsists of three wooden chests at positions (x=36.5 y=-81.5), (x=36.5 y=-80.5), and (x=36.5 y=-79.5).\n\n### Iron plate smelter near position (x=6.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (x=6.0, y=-60.0) and (x=8.0, y=-60.0).\n- Two wooden chests at positions (x=6.5, y=-58.5) and (x=6.5, y=-57.5).\n\nThe furnaces are smelting iron ore into iron plates. The chests are likely used for storing coal or iron ore. Both furnaces are waiting for ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron plate smelter and storage at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of:\n- One stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)\n- Five wooden chests at positions (x=-17.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-12.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-10.5, y=-48.5)\n- Three burner inserters at positions (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), (x=-9.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-8.5, y=-48.5)\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace to the storage\n\nThe furnace is smelting iron ore into iron plates. The chests are used for storing coal and iron plates. The inserters are transferring coal to the furnace and iron plates to the chests. The furnace is waiting for ingredients to smelt. The inserters are waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron plate storage at position (x=11.5, y=-48.5)\nConsists of 16 wooden chests at positions (x=11.5, y=-48.5) to (x=34.5, y=-48.5) and 10 wooden chests at positions (x=38.5, y=-48.5) to (x=46.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Copper plate smelter at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- One stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- One wooden chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5)\n\nThe furnace is smelting copper ore into copper plates. The chest is likely used for storing coal. The furnace is waiting for ingredients to smelt.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when failing to get an entity\n- Ensure the entity exists and is within the agent's reach before attempting to get it.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place a entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n### Transport belt blockage\n- Clear the transport belt at the drop position of the inserter to allow it to continue working. Inserter at (x=35.5, y=-85.5) is blocked because transport belt at (34.5, -85.5) is blocked.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n- No new functions were defined.\n```"}
