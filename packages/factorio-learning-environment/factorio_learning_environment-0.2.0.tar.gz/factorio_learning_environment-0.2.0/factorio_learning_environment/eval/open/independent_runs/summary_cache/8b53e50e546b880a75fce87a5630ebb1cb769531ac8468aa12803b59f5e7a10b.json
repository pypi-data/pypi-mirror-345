{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items between entities\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Research Lab Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position with automation science packs\n- Inserter connected to power network\n- Small Electric Poles for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected to the intended entities. Misalignment can lead to failed connections.\n\n### Errors in Power Network\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional power network. Ensure that power poles are properly placed and connected to each other and the entities they are meant to power.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are complete and that there are no missing pipes between fluid-generating and fluid-consuming entities. This will prevent warnings like \"no fluid present in connections.\"\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power\n- Make sure inserters are placed within the range of powered electric poles to avoid \"not receiving electricity\" warnings."}
