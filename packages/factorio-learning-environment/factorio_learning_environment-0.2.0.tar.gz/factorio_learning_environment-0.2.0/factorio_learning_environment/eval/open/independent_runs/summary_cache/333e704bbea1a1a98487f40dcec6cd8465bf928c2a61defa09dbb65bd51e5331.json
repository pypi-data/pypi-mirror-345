{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting water from Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- PipeGroup connecting steam from Boiler to Steam Engine\n- ElectricityGroup with poles connecting from Lab at (5.5, 5.5) to power source at (10.5, 34.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) for coal storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) for additional storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting copper ore\n\n### Iron Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) for storing coal and iron plates\n\n### Science Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, located at an unspecified position\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe and Electricity Connections\n- Ensure all pipes are properly connected to form a complete network from the water source to the steam engine.\n- Verify that all electric poles are connected to form a continuous power network from the power source to the lab and other entities requiring power.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target tile is unoccupied to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Resource Extraction\n- Ensure that the storage chests are not full to prevent mining operations from halting. Regularly empty the chests to maintain continuous mining operations."}
