{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) and another at position (54.5, -84.5). The chest at (52.5, -84.5) is full, halting mining operations.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) and another at position (-24.5, -67.5). The drill is out of fuel.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) and another at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (-16.5, -64.5) and (-14.5, -64.5) connected by a burner inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and another at position (5.0, 0.0), both waiting for ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Ore Storage Facility at Positions (0.5, -4.5) to (9.5, 0.5)\nConsists of multiple wooden chests storing copper ore.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using pickup_entity with incorrect object type\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to pick up is callable and of the correct type. Avoid using non-callable objects like 'Chest' in the pickup_entity function.\n\n### Errors due to full chests halting operations\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. Consider using inserters to automate the transfer of items from chests to other entities.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in mining drills\n- Ensure that all mining drills are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation. Automate fuel supply if possible.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items by checking the supply chain and ensuring that all connected entities are operational and not blocked."}
