{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-5.0, 2.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5), boiler (position -5.0, 2.5), steam engine (position 0.5, 6.5), pipes connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine, and small electric poles connecting steam engine to other entities.\n\n### Coal mine at position(16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position 16.0, 0.0), wooden chest (position 16.5, 1.5) to collect coal, and burner inserter (position 17.5, 1.5) to take coal from chest.\n\n### Iron ore mine at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill (position 19.5, 70.5), stone furnace (position 18.0, 68.0) to smelt iron ore, inserter (position 15.5, 68.5) to put iron ore into furnace, burner inserter (position 19.5, 68.5) to take iron plates from furnace, inserter (position 20.5, 68.5) to take iron plates from burner inserter, and output chest (position 21.5, 68.5).\n- Belt group connecting the electric mining drill to the inserter at position 15.5, 68.5\n- Belt group connecting the inserter at position 15.5, 68.5 to the burner inserter at position 19.5, 68.5\n- Belt group connecting the inserter at position 20.5, 68.5 to the output chest at position 21.5, 68.5\n\n### New Iron ore mine at position(18.5, 72.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill (position 18.5, 72.5) and transport belt (position 18.5, 70.5) to take iron ore from the drill.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts directly to a chest\n- Ensure that an inserter is used to take items from the chest before connecting to transport belts.\n\n### Errors when getting entities at a specific position\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to an existing entity with insufficient spacing\n- Increase the spacing or change the direction when placing entities next to an existing entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at a position occupied by another entity\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when the target position is too far away to place an entity\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Ensure that the drop position of the source entity is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that entities requiring power are connected to a power source and that the power source is functioning.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before they are used. For example, 'furnace_inserter' was not defined before being used.\n\n### Errors when attempting to retrieve a non-existent entity attribute\n- Verify that the attribute exists for the entity before attempting to retrieve it. For example, 'production' attribute does not exist for 'Generator' object.\n\n### Errors when entities are not working due to lack of ingredients or fuel\n- Ensure that entities have the necessary ingredients or fuel to function.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n### Function signature: `get_connection_amount(belt_at_drop_position, inserter.pickup_position, connection_type=Prototype.TransportBelt)`\n- Description: This function is supposed to get the connection amount between a belt and an inserter.\n- Failure mode: NameError when 'furnace_inserter' is not defined.\n \nImportant variables:\n- `belt_at_drop_position`: Entity, type not specified\n- `furnace_inserter`: Inserter, not defined\n- `inserter.pickup_position`: Position, type not specified\n- `Prototype.TransportBelt`: Type, not specified \n\n### Function signature: Not enough information to infer\n- Description: There is not enough information in the logs to infer the function signature."}
