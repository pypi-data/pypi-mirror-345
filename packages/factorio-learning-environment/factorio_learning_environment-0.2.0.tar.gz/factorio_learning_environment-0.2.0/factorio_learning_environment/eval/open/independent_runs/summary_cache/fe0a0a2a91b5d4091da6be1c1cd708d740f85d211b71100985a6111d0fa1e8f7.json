{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a warning indicating the output is blocked by an item on the ground. It is currently working and connected to a stone furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. It has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt and currently holds iron plates in its result inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure the target position for placing entities like Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts is unoccupied before attempting to place them. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. Double-check for typos or incorrect variable names to avoid `NameError`. For example, ensure that 'ore_furnace' is defined or correctly referenced.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Verify that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent exceptions due to insufficient items, such as coal.\n\n### Output blockage warnings\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or a clear path for the output of entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Furnace warnings due to lack of ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process to avoid warnings about missing ingredients."}
