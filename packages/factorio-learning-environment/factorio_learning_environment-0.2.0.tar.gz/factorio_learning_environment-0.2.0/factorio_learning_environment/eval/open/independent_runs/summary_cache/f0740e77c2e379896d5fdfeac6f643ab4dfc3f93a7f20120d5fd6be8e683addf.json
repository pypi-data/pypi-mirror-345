{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) processing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring coal from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage. This will avoid warnings like \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to continue mining.\"\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process, as this will prevent the furnace from entering a \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status. Regularly supply furnaces with the required materials to maintain production efficiency."}
