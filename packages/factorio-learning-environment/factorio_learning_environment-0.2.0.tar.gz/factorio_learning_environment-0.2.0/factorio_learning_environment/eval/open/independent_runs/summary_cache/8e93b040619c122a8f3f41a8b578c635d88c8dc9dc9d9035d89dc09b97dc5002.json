{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (10.5, 31.5) and (12.5, 34.5)\n- Pipes at positions (8.5, 34.5), (8.5, 37.5), and (9.5, 37.5)\n\n### Offshore Pump System\n1. Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n   - Connected to pipes at positions (-7.5, 24.5), (-6.5, 24.5), and (-6.5, 25.5)\n2. Offshore Pump at position (0.5, 30.5)\n   - Connected to pipes at positions (1.5, 29.5), (1.5, 30.5), and (1.5, 31.5)\n\n### Boiler System\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 27.0)\n  - Connected to pipes at positions (-3.5, 26.5) and (-3.5, 27.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n  - Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) connected to power\n\n### Storage and Transfer\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups across various positions, facilitating fluid transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the target location before placing a pipe. Clear obstructions if necessary.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Connection\n- Verify that all electrical components are properly connected to the power network to avoid \"not connected to power network\" warnings.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source to avoid \"not receiving electricity\" warnings.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Make sure all fluid connections are properly established to prevent \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\" warnings."}
