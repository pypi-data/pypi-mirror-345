{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5): Status - Working\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0): Status - Not Connected\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5): Status - Not Connected\n- Pipe Group connecting various positions: \n  - Pipe at position (-9.5, 23.5): Status - Full Output\n  - Pipe at position (-7.5, 23.5): Status - Empty\n  - Pipe at position (-4.5, 16.5): Status - Empty\n  - Pipe at position (-4.5, 24.5): Status - Empty\n  - Pipe at position (-5.5, 24.5): Status - Empty\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0): Status - No Ingredients\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715): Status - Not Plugged in Electric Network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly aligned and connected to form a continuous path from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine. Verify that there are no obstructions or incorrect placements causing disconnections.\n\n### Errors Due to Overlapping or Obstructed Placement\n- Avoid placing pipes or other entities where the terrain is unplaceable, such as over water or where other objects are already present. Check the terrain and clear any obstructions before placing.\n\n### Errors with Crafting Requirements\n- Ensure you have the necessary ingredients and crafting machines available for crafting items like iron plates or pipe-to-ground. Verify that the required resources are available in the inventory or craftable with the current setup.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Network\n- Ensure that the electricity network is properly connected and all components are plugged in to function correctly. Check connections between the steam engine, boiler, and electricity group to ensure they are part of the same network.\n\nBy addressing these errors, you can improve the efficiency and functionality of your structures in the game."}
