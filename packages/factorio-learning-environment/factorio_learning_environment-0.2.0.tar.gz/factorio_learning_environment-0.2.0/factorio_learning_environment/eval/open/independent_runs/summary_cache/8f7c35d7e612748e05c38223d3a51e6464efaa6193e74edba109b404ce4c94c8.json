{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Repeated attempts were made to locate, craft, and deploy a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but none succeeded due to missing inventory and insufficient resources. The agent did interact with existing furnace structures (an iron furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) for smelting operations; however, these were pre\u2010existing map entities and not newly constructed in the current steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Call Usage:\n  \u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (for example, do not use \u201cradius\u201d with get_entities).\n  \u2013 Confirm the correct parameter count (ensure not to supply extra positional arguments) by reviewing the function\u2019s signature.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Checks:\n  \u2013 Verify that a Lab item exists in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  \n\u2022 Safe Data Handling:\n  \u2013 Ensure that objects returned by lookup functions are not None before iterating over them (or apply a fallback to an empty list).\n\n\u2022 Resource and Crafting Dependencies:\n  \u2013 Before initiating Lab crafting, prevalidate that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available or can be produced.\n  \u2013 Manage multi-level crafting dependencies by confirming that intermediate ingredients are craftable with the available resources and equipment."}
