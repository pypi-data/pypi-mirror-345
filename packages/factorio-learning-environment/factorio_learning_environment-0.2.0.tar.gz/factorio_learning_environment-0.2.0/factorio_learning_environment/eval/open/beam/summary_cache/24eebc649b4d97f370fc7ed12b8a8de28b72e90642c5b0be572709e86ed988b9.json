{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe recipe statuses for both the copper plate and iron gear wheel remain unchanged and disabled, indicating that I still cannot craft these items despite having gathered additional resources. \n\n### Current Inventory:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 8 pieces of coal\n- 5 pieces of iron ore\n- 5 pieces of copper ore\n- 3 pieces of iron plates\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Recipe Status**: The recipes for both copper plates and iron gear wheels are still disabled, which suggests that I may need to unlock certain technologies or prerequisites to enable crafting.\n2. **Resource Gathering**: While I have gathered a decent amount of resources, the inability to craft is limiting my progress.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Research Technologies**: I should check if there are any technologies that need to be researched to enable the crafting of copper plates and iron gear wheels. This may involve using some of my resources to create science packs if I have the necessary items.\n2. **Explore Other Crafting Options**: If there are other items I can craft with my current inventory, I should explore those options as well.\n\nLet's check the available technologies to see what might be required to unlock the recipes for copper plates and iron gear wheels.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the available technologies and their requirements\navailable_technologies = get_available_technologies()\nprint(f\"Available Technologies: {available_technologies}\")\n\n# Check if there are any specific technologies required for copper plates and iron gear wheels\ncopper_plate_tech = get_technology_requirements(Prototype.CopperPlate)\niron_gear_wheel_tech = get_technology_requirements(Prototype.IronGearWheel)\nprint(f\"Technology requirements for Copper Plate: {copper_plate_tech}\")\nprint(f\"Technology requirements for Iron Gear Wheel: {iron_gear_wheel_tech}\")", "summary_range": "[1-106]"}
