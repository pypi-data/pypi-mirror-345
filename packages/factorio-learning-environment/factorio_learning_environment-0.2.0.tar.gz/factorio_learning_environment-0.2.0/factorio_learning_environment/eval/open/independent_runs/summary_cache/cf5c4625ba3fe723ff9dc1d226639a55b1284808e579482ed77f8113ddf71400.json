{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with a status of EntityStatus.WORKING and currently processing iron ore.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) with an inventory containing 100 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. For example, the wooden chest could not be placed at (3.0, 1.0) because the agent was too far away.\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are gathered before attempting to craft an item. The agent could not craft a wooden chest because wood was not available initially.\n\n### Errors when trying to research technologies without sufficient resources\n- Gather enough Automation Science Packs to unlock necessary technologies before attempting to craft advanced items like the Steel Chest. The agent lacked the required science packs to research Steel Processing technology."}
