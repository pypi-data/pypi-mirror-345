{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron ore (39998 units)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Transport Belt and Wooden Chest Placement Errors**: Ensure the target location for placing transport belts and wooden chests is not occupied by another entity or object. Verify that there is enough space and that the location is suitable for the entity type.\n- **Burner Inserter Placement Errors**: Confirm that the desired location for placing burner inserters is valid and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features.\n\n### Errors related to entity retrieval\n- **Stone Furnace Retrieval Errors**: When attempting to retrieve a stone furnace at a specific position, ensure that the entity exists at that location. Double-check the coordinates and make sure the furnace is placed correctly before attempting to access it.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- **Stone Furnace Movement Errors**: Before moving a stone furnace, verify that the new location is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Ensure that the move operation does not conflict with existing entities or terrain features.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Clearing Drill's Drop Position**: Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to prevent output blockage and ensure continuous operation of the mining drill."}
