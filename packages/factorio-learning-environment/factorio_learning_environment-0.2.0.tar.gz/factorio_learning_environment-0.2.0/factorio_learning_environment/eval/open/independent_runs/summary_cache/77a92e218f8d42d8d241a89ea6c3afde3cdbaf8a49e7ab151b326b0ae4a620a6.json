{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt and its fuel source is full. It has produced 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Group\n- Located at position x=-12.5, y=21.5, consisting of pipes connecting positions (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5). The status of this pipe group is empty.\n\n### Electricity Group\n- Consists of electric poles located at various positions including (x=-7.5, y=17.5), (x=-6.5, y=16.5), (x=-8.5, y=17.5), and others extending to (x=-8.5, y=21.5), (x=-8.5, y=20.5), (x=-8.5, y=16.5). The voltage is currently at 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving to new areas\n- Ensure that indices used in movement commands are integers, as string indices can cause movement errors.\n\n### Errors when placing offshore pumps\n- Verify that the position for placing an offshore pump is suitable before attempting placement to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors when placing boilers and steam engines\n- Check the suitability of the position before placing boilers and steam engines to ensure they can be placed correctly.\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pumps and boilers\n- Ensure that the connection between offshore pumps and boilers is feasible and that pipes are correctly aligned to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles\n- Make sure that electric poles are placed in a manner that allows for successful connections to avoid placement issues."}
