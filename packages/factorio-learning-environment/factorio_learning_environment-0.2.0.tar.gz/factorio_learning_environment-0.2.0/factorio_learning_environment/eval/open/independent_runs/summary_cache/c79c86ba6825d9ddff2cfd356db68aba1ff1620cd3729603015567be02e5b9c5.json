{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Contains iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Warnings: Out of fuel\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner mining drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), Stone furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all entities such as mining drills and inserters. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure inserters are properly aligned and have a clear path to transfer items between entities. Regularly check that inserters are fueled and positioned correctly to avoid interruptions in the production line.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent them from becoming full. Regularly extract items from chests to maintain the flow of resources and prevent mining drills from stopping due to full drop positions.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly check the input inventory of furnaces and supply them with the required materials to avoid idle time and maximize production efficiency."}
