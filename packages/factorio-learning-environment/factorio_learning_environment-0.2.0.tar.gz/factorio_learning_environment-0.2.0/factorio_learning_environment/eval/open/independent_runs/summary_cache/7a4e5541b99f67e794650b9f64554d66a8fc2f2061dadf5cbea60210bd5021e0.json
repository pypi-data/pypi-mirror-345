{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status NO_FUEL and connected to pipes at positions (x=-0.5, y=21.5), (x=1.5, y=21.5), (x=0.5, y=21.5), (x=2.5, y=21.5), (x=3.5, y=21.5), (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections', and status NOT_CONNECTED. Connected to pipes at positions (x=16.5, y=17.5) and (x=17.5, y=17.5).\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING, connected to pipes at positions (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=-8.5, y=23.5).\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **PipeGroup** for fluid system 11963 at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) with status EMPTY, consisting of pipes from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n- **PipeGroup** for fluid system 11974 at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, consisting of pipes from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with id 22397, consisting of poles at various positions including (x=35.5, y=24.5), (x=10.5, y=13.5), (x=7.5, y=8.5), (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=20.5, y=19.5), (x=33.5, y=24.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect, such as pipes between the boiler and steam engine, are compatible and correctly aligned. Verify that there are no obstructions and that the connection path is valid.\n\n### Errors with Power Connection\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to a power pole. Ensure that the power poles are placed in a position where they can connect to the steam engine without obstruction.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target location is free of other objects. Use a clear area to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors in Inserting Items\n- Check your inventory before attempting to insert items into an entity. Ensure you have the required items available to insert.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine, {Prototype.Pipe, Prototype.UndergroundPipe})`: Failed due to incompatible or obstructed connection path.\n- `place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=Position(x=16.5, y=19.5))`: Failed due to an existing object obstructing the placement.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: A list of connected pipes, intended to link the boiler and steam engine.\n- `pole_1`: Intended to represent a small electric pole at a specific position."}
