{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Transport belts connecting from (41.5, -85.5) to (41.5, -81.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5) transferring items from the mining drill to the wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -81.5) storing coal\n- Iron Chest at position (42.5, -80.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of multiple belt groups and individual belts facilitating the movement of items across the map:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5) and outputs from (49.5, -86.5) to (47.5, -86.5)\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (54.5, -86.5) to (52.5, -86.5) and outputs from (52.5, -82.5) to (53.5, -83.5)\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (41.5, -85.5) to (41.5, -83.5) and outputs from (41.5, -83.5) to (41.5, -81.5)\n- Additional belts connecting various points on the map for item transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Ensure there is a clear and suitable position for placing chests. Avoid attempting to place a chest where there is an existing object.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use an inserter to input items into a chest instead of connecting belts directly to the chest.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters\n- Verify there is enough space for placing an inserter. Ensure the target position is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
