{"content": "It seems there is a persistent issue with the `time` module not being recognized. This could be due to the environment where the code is being executed not having access to standard Python libraries. Here are a few steps to address this:\n\n1. **Ensure Import Statement**: Double-check that the `import time` statement is at the top of your script and is not being removed or commented out accidentally.\n\n2. **Environment Constraints**: If the environment restricts the use of the `time` module, you may need to remove the `time.sleep()` calls or replace them with another mechanism for pausing, if necessary.\n\n3. **Alternative Logging**: If pausing is not crucial, you can simply log messages without delays. This would mean removing the `time.sleep(duration)` line from the `pause_with_logging` function.\n\nHere's how you can modify the script to avoid using `time.sleep()`:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting thorough diagnostic procedure with stepped logging...\")\n\ndef log_message(message):\n    print(message)\n\ntry:\n    # Retrieve necessary entities\n    log_message(\"Fetching entities from the environment...\")\n    offshore_pumps = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    boilers = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    steam_engines = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    electric_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    assembling_machines = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n\n    # Add immediate logging of entities count\n    log_message(f\"Offshore Pumps found: {len(offshore_pumps)}\")\n    log_message(f\"Boilers found: {len(boilers)}\")\n    log_message(f\"Steam Engines found: {len(steam_engines)}\")\n    log_message(f\"Electric Poles found: {len(electric_poles)}\")\n    log_message(f\"Assembling Machines found: {len(assembling_machines)}\")\n\n    # Check for missing entities\n    missing_entities = []\n    if not offshore_pumps: missing_entities.append(\"Offshore Pump\")\n    if not boilers: missing_entities.append(\"Boiler\")\n    if not steam_engines: missing_entities.append(\"Steam Engine\")\n    if not electric_poles: missing_entities.append(\"Electric Pole\")\n    if not assembling_machines: missing_entities.append(\"Assembling Machine\")\n    if missing_entities:\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Missing entities: {', '.join(missing_entities)}\")\n\n    print(\"All necessary entities are retrieved.\")\n\n    # Assign first instance of each entity type\n    offshore_pump = offshore_pumps[0]\n    boiler = boilers[0]\n    steam_engine = steam_engines[0]\n    electric_pole = electric_poles[0]\n    assembling_machine = assembling_machines[0]\n\n    # Move to the boiler's position\n    log_message(f\"Moving to Boiler at {boiler.position}\")\n    move_to(boiler.position)\n    log_message(\"Arrived at Boiler's position.\")\n\n    # Fuel inspection and refueling\n    current_fuel_level = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    log_message(f\"Boiler's current fuel level: {current_fuel_level}\")\n\n    # Check and refuel the boiler\n    if current_fuel_level < 5:\n        fuel_needed = 10 - current_fuel_level\n        player_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n        player_coal = player_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n        log_message(f\"Player coal available: {player_coal}\")\n        \n        if player_coal >= fuel_needed:\n            print(f\"Refueling Boiler with {fuel_needed} coal.\")\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, fuel_needed)\n            current_fuel_level = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n            log_message(f\"Boiler successfully refueled: new coal level is {current_fuel_level}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Insufficient coal in player's inventory for refueling.\")\n\n    # Attempt to connect entities\n    log_message(\"Attempting to establish connections between entities...\")\n    water_connection = connect_entities(offshore_pump, boiler)\n    log_message(f\"Water connection status: {'Successful' if water_connection else 'Failed'}\")\n\n    steam_connection = connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine)\n    log_message(f\"Steam connection status: {'Successful' if steam_connection else 'Failed'}\")\n\n    electric_connection = connect_entities(steam_engine, electric_pole) and connect_entities(electric_pole, assembling_machine)\n    log_message(f\"Electric connection status: {'Successful' if electric_connection else 'Failed'}\")\n\n    # Output statuses\n    log_message(f\"Boiler Status: {boiler.status}, Fuel Level: {current_fuel_level}\")\n    log_message(f\"Steam Engine Status: {steam_engine.status}, Energy Output: {steam_engine.energy}\")\n\n    assembling_machine_warnings = assembling_machine.warnings or 'None'\n    log_message(f\"Assembling Machine Status: {assembling_machine.status}, Warnings: {", "summary_range": "[1-342]"}
