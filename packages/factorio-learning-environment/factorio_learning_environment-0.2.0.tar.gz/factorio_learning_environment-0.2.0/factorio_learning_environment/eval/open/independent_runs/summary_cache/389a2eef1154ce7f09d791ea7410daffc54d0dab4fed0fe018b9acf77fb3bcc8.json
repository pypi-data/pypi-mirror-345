{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.0, 2.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position 2.5, 2.5), boiler(position -1.5, 2.5) and offshore pump (position -4.5, 2.5)\n\n### Chest at position(-14.5, -52.5)\nContains 37 iron plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting/inserting items from/into inventory to chest\n- The agent is failing to transfer items from its inventory to a chest due to an issue with variable scope, specifically not being able to access a local variable 'x'. This suggests there's a problem in the function or loop where the chest's coordinates are being used.\n- Ensure that the chest coordinates are correctly passed and accessible within the function responsible for item transfer.\n- Debug the variable scope to ensure 'x' and other relevant variables are properly defined and accessible during the extraction/insertion process.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place a entity to a tile before attempting placing. The agent is trying to place a furnace at (-15.5, -52.5) and a chest at (-13.5, -51.5) but fails because the placement conditions are not met.\n- Before placing, check if the tile is free of other entities and if the terrain is suitable for the entity to be placed.\n\n### Errors when crafting\n- The agent is failing to craft automation science packs because it cannot craft copper plates. This is because it requires a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace.\n- Ensure that the agent has access to a furnace or crafting machine before attempting to craft copper plates.\n\n### Errors when extracting\n- The agent is failing to extract items.\n- Check if the agent is in range of the entity it is trying to extract from.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- No new functions were defined in this step.\n"}
