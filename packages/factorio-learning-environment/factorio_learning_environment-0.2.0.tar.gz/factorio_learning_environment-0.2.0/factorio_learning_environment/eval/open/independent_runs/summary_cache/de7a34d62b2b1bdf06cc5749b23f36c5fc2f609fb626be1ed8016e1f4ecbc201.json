{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore, storing it in a chest, and then smelting it into iron plates using a stone furnace. The burner inserter facilitates the transfer of iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Production and Smelting Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis facility is responsible for mining coal, storing it in a chest, and then using it as fuel for the stone furnace to smelt other ores. The burner inserter transfers coal from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into a structure, verify that you have the required items in your inventory to prevent insertion errors. For example, ensure you have coal available before trying to refuel a furnace."}
