{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 2.5)\n\n### Electric pole at position (9.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 9.5, 6.5)\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 18) and status (no ingredients to smelt)\n\n### Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 7) and status (no ingredients to smelt)\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) with an empty inventory\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 6.5, 6.5) requiring 10 automation science packs and currently has no power\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric poles at positions (1.5, 1.5), (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 2.5), (5.5, 4.5), and (9.5, 6.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using electric poles\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed within the range of an electric network to avoid the status \"NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK.\"\n\n### Errors related to lab power\n- Verify that the lab is connected to a powered electric pole. If the lab is still not powered, check the connections and ensure the electric poles are functional.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the position where you are placing an entity is not occupied by another entity to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors related to building box dimensions\n- Check the dimensions of the entities being placed to ensure they fit within the defined building box. If you encounter an error regarding the building box, verify the width and height of the entity being placed."}
