{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction and Processing at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a Pumpjack (position: x=17.5, y=40.5), Oil Refinery (position: x=23.5, y=43.5), Storage Tank (position: x=29.5, y=44.5), Chemical Plant (position: x=29.5, y=49.5), and associated pipes and power poles. The Oil Refinery and Chemical Plant are connected to the power network via the Electricity Group (id=66748, poles=[...]).\n\n### Electricity Generation at position (0.5, 0.0)\nConsists of a Boiler (position: x=0.5, y=0.0) and associated pipes. The Boiler is fueled with coal and is connected to an Offshore Pump (position: x=-9.5, y=-0.5) via a Pipe Group (fluid=water, position=x=-8.5 y=-0.5).\n\n### Water Supply at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an Offshore Pump (position: x=-9.5, y=-0.5) and associated pipes.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple Pipe Groups:\n- Pipe Group (fluid=water, position=x=-8.5 y=-0.5, status=EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT)\n- Pipe Group (fluid=crude-oil, position=x=19.5 y=38.5, status=EntityStatus.EMPTY)\n- Pipe Group (position=x=25.5 y=40.5, status=EntityStatus.EMPTY)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when using entities without power\n  - Ensure that entities requiring power are connected to a power, specifically check if the power network is functioning.\n* Errors when connecting entities without fluid in the source entity\n  - Ensure that the source entity has fluid in it before attempting to connect it to another entity that requires fluid input.\n* Errors when entities are not connected properly\n  - Ensure that entities are connected properly.\n* Errors when accessing list indices out of range\n  - Ensure that list indices are within the valid range before accessing them.\n* Errors when using undefined variables or attributes\n  - Ensure that all variables and attributes are defined before using them. Specifically, check the documentation for the correct attribute names.\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied or unplaceable positions\n  - Ensure that the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when connecting entities with invalid connections\n  - Ensure that the source and target entities are correctly connected and that the connections are not blocked.\n* Errors when entities are not receiving required ingredients\n  - Ensure that the required ingredients are available and inserted into the entity.\n* Errors when accessing attributes of incorrect type\n  - Ensure that the attribute exists for the given entity type. \n* Errors when using 'tuple' object as if it had an attribute 'value'\n  - Ensure that the correct data type is being used. \n* Errors when using undefined variables\n  - Ensure that variables are defined before using them. \n* Errors when inserting items into entities without having the required items in inventory\n  - Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n* Errors when rearranging power generation\n  - Ensure that a suitable position is found for the boiler and steam engine before attempting to place them.\n* Errors when checking positions for entity placement\n  - Ensure that the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when clearing area/placing steam engine\n  - Ensure that the area is cleared before attempting to place the steam engine.\n* Errors when setting up power generation: BaseModel.__init__() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given\n  - Review the code for setting up power generation and ensure it is correctly implemented.\n* Errors when setting up alternative steam engine placement: BaseModel.__init__() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given\n  - Review the code for setting up alternative steam engine placement and ensure it is correctly implemented.\n* Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler: Did not find any valid connections between source Prototype.OffshorePump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 and target Prototype.Boiler at x=0.5 y=0.0\n  - Ensure that the source and target entities are correctly connected and that the connections are not blocked.\n* Errors when checking entity status: list index out of range\n  - Ensure that list indices are within the valid range before accessing them.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables that have been assigned:\n- `storage_tank`: StorageTank entity\n- `chemical_plant`: ChemicalPlant entity\n- `oil_refinery`: OilRefinery entity\n- `boiler`: Boiler entity\n- `"}
