{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection System\n- **Coal Mining Drill** at position (52.0, -82.0)\n  - Operational and extracting coal.\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (52.5, -79.5)\n  - Positioned to move items into the coal chest.\n  - Status: Waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (52.5, -77.5)\n  - Collects coal from the inserter.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System\n- **Iron Ore Mining Drill** at position (-12.0, -51.0)\n  - Operational and extracting iron ore.\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -48.5)\n  - Positioned to move items into the iron ore chest.\n  - Status: Waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-8.5, -49.5)\n  - Collects iron ore from the inserter.\n\n### Iron Smelting System\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Operational and smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Status: Working with coal as fuel and iron ore as source ingredient.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to collisions or occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile for placement is free from other entities or items on the ground.\n- Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction or reference position to avoid collisions.\n- Check for existing entities like wooden chests or items on the ground that might block placement.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to interact with it.\n- Ensure that the entity type matches the expected type at the given position.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `place_entity_next_to` (Prototype, reference_position, direction): Handles entity placement next to a reference position. Ensure spacing and direction are correctly set to avoid collisions.\n  - `get_entity` (Prototype, position): Retrieves an entity at a specified position. Ensure the entity exists at the position before calling.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `coal_chest_position`: Position of the coal collection chest.\n  - `iron_ore_chest_position`: Position of the iron ore collection chest.\n  - `stone_furnace_position`: Position of the stone furnace for smelting."}
