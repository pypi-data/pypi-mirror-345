{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions(-16.5, 19.5), (-16.5, 18.5), (-16.5, 21.5), (-16.5, 20.5), (-15.5, 19.5), (-19.5, 22.5)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position(-18.0, -49.0) which is currently not receiving any ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace at position(5.0, -73.0) which is currently smelting copper ore into iron plates.\n\n### Research lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5) which is currently not in research progress.\n\n### Assembling machine for automation science pack at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5) which is currently not receiving electricity and cannot create automation science pack due to missing resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure you have the required crafting machine or furnace available to craft items. In this case, copper plates cannot be crafted without a furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. The error indicates that there was an attempt to insert copper ore into a furnace without having any copper ore in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when using electricity\n- Ensure that your electricity generation structures (like steam engines) are connected to a power network and have the necessary inputs (like water) to function properly. The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Errors with no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position(-18.0, -49.0) has no ingredients to smelt, which is causing it to be inactive."}
