{"content": "The attempt to check the crafting recipe for an Electric Furnace has produced errors, indicating that the recipe retrieved was for an **Electric Mining Drill** instead of the intended Electric Furnace. Additionally, there was a mistake in the `all()` function call, which caused a type error due to incorrect argument handling.\n\n### Current Findings:\n1. **Electric Furnace Recipe Retrieval**: The recipe retrieved was incorrect, showing the requirements for an Electric Mining Drill instead.\n2. **Error in Crafting Check**: The `all()` function was incorrectly structured, leading to a type error due to multiple arguments being passed instead of a single iterable.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Correctly Retrieve the Electric Furnace Recipe**: I will ensure to get the correct prototype for the Electric Furnace.\n2. **Check Required Materials**: Once the correct recipe is retrieved, I will verify if I have the necessary materials for crafting the Electric Furnace.\n3. **Attempt to Craft the Electric Furnace**: If materials are available, I will proceed with crafting.\n\nLet's proceed by correctly retrieving the Electric Furnace recipe and checking its requirements. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Retrieve the correct recipe for Electric Furnace\nelectric_furnace_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.ElectricFurnace)  # Ensure to get the Electric Furnace recipe\n\n# Print the Electric Furnace recipe to understand its requirements\nprint(f\"Current Electric Furnace Recipe: {electric_furnace_recipe}\")  # Display the Electric Furnace recipe details \n\n# List necessary materials for crafting Electric Furnace\nrequired_materials = {\n    \"Iron Plates\": 3,\n    \"Copper Plates\": 1,\n    \"Stone\": 1\n}\n\n# Check if I have the required materials\navailable_materials = inspect_inventory()  # Inspect the inventory to confirm contents\n\n# Verify availability of required materials\ncan_craft = (available_materials.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= required_materials[\"Iron Plates\"] and\n              available_materials.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0) >= required_materials[\"Copper Plates\"] and\n              available_materials.get(Prototype.Stone, 0) >= required_materials[\"Stone\"])\n\n# If there are sufficient materials, then craft Electric Furnace\nif can_craft:\n    print(\"Crafting Electric Furnace with available materials.\")\n    craft_item(Prototype.ElectricFurnace)  # Attempting to craft Electric Furnace\nelse:\n    print(\"Insufficient materials to craft Electric Furnace.\")  # Insufficient materials case", "summary_range": "[1-402]"}
