{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-63\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. It is currently not operational as the boiler is out of fuel and the steam engine reports no fluid input.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water. Status: `WORKING`.\n*   **Pipe Group** from Position(x=-8.5, y=-0.5) to Position(x=-4.5, y=0.5): Transports water to the boiler. Status: `FULL_OUTPUT`. Contains 6 pipes.\n*   **Boiler** at Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5): Heats water into steam using coal. Status: `NO_FUEL`. Steam output at Position(x=-6.5, y=2.5).\n*   **Pipe Group** from Position(x=-6.5, y=2.5) to Position(x=-2.5, y=6.5): Intended to transport steam to the steam engine. Status: `EMPTY`. Contains multiple pipes.\n*   **Steam Engine** at Position(x=0.5, y=6.5): Intended to generate power from steam. Status: `NOT_CONNECTED`, `NO_INPUT_LIQUID`.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position(x=17.5, y=1.5)\nExtracts coal and places it into a chest via an inserter chain. Currently inactive due to lack of power.\n*   **Electric Mining Drill** at Position(x=17.5, y=1.5): Mines coal. Status: `NO_POWER`. Drops coal at Position(x=17.5, y=3.5).\n*   **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=17.5, y=3.5): Intermediate storage for coal.\n*   **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=17.5"}
