{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace. The inserter is frequently repositioned and refueled to ensure proper alignment and operation.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or setup issues with the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collision with existing entities before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position if placement fails.\n\n### Errors in inserter alignment\n- Verify the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they correctly transfer items between entities. Frequent repositioning may indicate misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors in resource transfer\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly configured to pick up and drop items at the intended positions. Misalignment can prevent resources from reaching their destination.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
