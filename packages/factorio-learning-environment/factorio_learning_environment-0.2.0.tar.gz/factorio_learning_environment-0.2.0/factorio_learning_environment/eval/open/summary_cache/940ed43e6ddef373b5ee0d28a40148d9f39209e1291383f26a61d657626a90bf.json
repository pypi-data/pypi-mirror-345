{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal but output blocked due to no sink entity accepting output items\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal but lacking ingredients to smelt\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace, currently out of fuel and waiting for source items\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine, out of fuel and waiting for space in destination\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine, out of fuel and waiting for source items\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, not receiving electricity and with zero energy\n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide power to assembling machine and inserters, but power network is not effectively energizing the assembler\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, the assembling machine is not powered, and burner inserters lack fuel, causing production to stall. The burner mining drill\u2019s output is blocked due to no downstream entity accepting its output.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power despite pole connections\n- Ensure that electric poles are properly connected in a continuous power network that includes the assembling machine and all inserters.\n- Verify that poles have sufficient power supply and are not isolated.\n- Check that the assembling machine\u2019s connection points align with the electric poles\u2019 coverage.\n- Confirm the power network voltage and energy levels are adequate to power all connected entities.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters and other entities due to \"No coal to insert\"\n- Before inserting coal into burner inserters or other fuel-consuming entities, confirm that the player inventory contains sufficient coal.\n- Avoid attempting to insert coal multiple times without replenishing inventory, as repeated failures occur when inventory is empty.\n- Implement checks or inventory queries to ensure coal availability before insertion attempts.\n\n### Errors caused by burner inserters running out of fuel\n- Insert coal into burner inserters regularly to keep them fueled; otherwise, they will stop working and block item transfer.\n- Monitor fuel levels of burner inserters and automate or schedule refueling to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to output blockage from burner mining drill\n- Ensure that the output of the burner mining drill is connected to a valid sink entity (e.g., inserter or chest) to accept mined items.\n- Avoid situations where items accumulate on the ground blocking the drill\u2019s output, which halts mining.\n\n### Errors inserting items when no ingredients are available\n- Confirm that required input items (e.g., iron ore for the furnace) are present in inventory before attempting insertion.\n- Avoid insertion attempts when inventory lacks the needed items to prevent failed operations.\n\n### General tips to mitigate fuel and power related errors\n- Regularly harvest and maintain a stockpile of coal to fuel burner entities.\n- Consider transitioning to electric mining drills and inserters to reduce dependence on fuel.\n- Verify power network connectivity and energy availability frequently to prevent production halts.\n- Use inventory checks before insertion operations to avoid exceptions related to missing items.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
