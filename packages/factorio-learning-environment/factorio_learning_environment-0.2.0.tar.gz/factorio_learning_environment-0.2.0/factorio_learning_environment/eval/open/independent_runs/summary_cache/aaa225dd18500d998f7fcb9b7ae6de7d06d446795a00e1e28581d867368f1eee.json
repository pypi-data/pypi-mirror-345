{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Transfer System at Position (40.5, -83.5) to (42.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing 800 units of coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, currently operational.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal between chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) containing 119 units of coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled by coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt, with 31 iron plates in the result inventory.\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) fueled by coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt, with 27 iron plates in the result inventory.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) each containing 5 units of coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent stoppage in production. The chest at position (40.5, -83.5) is full, causing the burner mining drill and burner inserter to stop functioning properly.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production. Both furnaces at positions (61.0, -54.0) and (64.0, -53.0) are currently without ingredients to smelt.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or important variables have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
