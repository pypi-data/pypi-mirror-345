{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to a Transport Belt starting at (x=-12.5, y=-51.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) where iron ore is processed into iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the output belt\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill output to the furnace input\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction RIGHT\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction DOWN\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Blocked Output\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is emptied regularly to prevent mining stoppages.\n- Check that the furnace output belt is not blocked to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operation\n- Verify that inserters have enough space in their destination to avoid waiting states. Ensure that the destination entities (e.g., belts or chests) have available capacity.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the logs provided.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources such as 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
