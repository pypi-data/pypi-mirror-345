The second furnace remains idle with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. We should gather more iron ore to keep both furnaces operational.\n2. Once we have enough iron plates, we can start crafting additional entities, such as mining drills or more furnaces, to expand our production capabilities.\n\nLet's proceed to gather more iron ore from the nearest resource patch.\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1.
