Check inventory levels regularly to avoid failed insertions.\n\n### Errors when extracting resources\n- Ensure you are positioned correctly and have the necessary permissions to extract resources from entities. Double-check the entity status and inventory capacity.\n\n### Errors with full storage\n- Regularly check and clear storage chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full output chests. Ensure there is sufficient space in connected chests to continue operations.\n\n### Errors with insufficient ingredients in furnaces\n- Monitor the ingredient levels in furnaces to ensure continuous production. Refill ingredients promptly to avoid production stoppages."}
