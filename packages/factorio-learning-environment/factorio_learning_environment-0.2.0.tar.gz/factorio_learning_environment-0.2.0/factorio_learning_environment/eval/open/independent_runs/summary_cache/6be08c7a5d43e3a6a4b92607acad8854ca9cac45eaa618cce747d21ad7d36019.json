{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The generator is responsible for converting water into steam to produce electricity.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5). The lab is used for researching technologies, requiring automation science packs to function.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, including:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 33836, position -18.5, 16.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 33839, position -12.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 33840, position -8.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 33842, position -10.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 33843, position -7.5, 23.5)\nThis network facilitates the transportation of fluids between the offshore pump and the boiler.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of small electric poles located at positions (-19.5, 22.5), (-16.5, 19.5), and (-15.5, 19.5). This group provides electrical power to nearby entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to lab inventory access\n- Ensure that the entity being inspected has the correct attributes. The error indicates that the 'Position' object does not have a 'name' attribute. Verify that you are accessing the correct entity type when attempting to inspect inventory.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient resources\n- Ensure that all required resources, such as automation science packs for the lab, are available before attempting to perform actions that depend on them."}
