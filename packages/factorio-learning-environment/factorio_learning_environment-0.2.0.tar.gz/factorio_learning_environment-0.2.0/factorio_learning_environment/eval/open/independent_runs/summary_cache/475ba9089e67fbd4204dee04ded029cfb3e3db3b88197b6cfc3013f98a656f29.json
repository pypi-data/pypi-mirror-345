{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace is currently full with iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) with coal as fuel, facing downwards. The drill is connected to a transport belt and a burner inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) with coal as fuel, facing right. It is responsible for moving items from the mining drill to the transport belt.\n- BeltGroup consisting of transport belts connecting positions (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5), facilitating the movement of mined resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at the intended position before attempting placement. Check for obstructions or occupied tiles that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors when extending transport belts\n- Verify that the path for extending transport belts is clear and unoccupied. Ensure that the belt can be extended without obstruction.\n\n### Errors with output blockages\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from production entities like mining drills. This will prevent the output from being blocked.\n\n### Errors with full inventory\n- Regularly check and clear full inventories of entities such as furnaces and inserters to maintain production flow and prevent bottlenecks."}
