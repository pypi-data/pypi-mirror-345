{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to two wooden chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to wooden chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to wooden chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage. Includes a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) for transferring items.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Multiple wooden chests surrounding the furnaces for storing copper ore and copper plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chests at positions (-20.5, -63.5) and (-23.5, -61.5) for storing iron plates and iron ore, respectively.\n- Burner inserter at position (-19.5, -61.5) for transferring items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available before attempting to craft items. For example, ensure enough wood is available to craft additional chests.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Adjust spacing or direction if an entity already exists at the desired location.\n\n### Errors Related to Full Inventory\n- Before inserting items into an entity, check if the entity's inventory has enough space to accommodate the items. For instance, avoid inserting coal into a furnace if its inventory is already full."}
