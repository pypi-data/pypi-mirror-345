{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent attempted to place various entities such as furnaces, chests, and transport belts, but all placement attempts failed. Therefore, no structures have been established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the tile where you intend to place an entity is buildable. Check for any obstructions or restrictions before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Verify that the position is not occupied by another entity before placing a new one. Attempting to place entities in occupied spaces will result in failure.\n\n### Errors when supplying resources to non-existent or incorrectly placed entities\n- Confirm that the entity you are trying to supply resources to is correctly placed and exists on the map. Supplying resources to non-existent entities will result in errors.\n\n### Errors when using transport belts\n- Ensure that the starting position for placing transport belts is valid and not occupied. Verify that the entire path for the transport belt is clear before placement.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Regularly check for clear areas and ensure that the identified areas remain clear before attempting to place entities."}
