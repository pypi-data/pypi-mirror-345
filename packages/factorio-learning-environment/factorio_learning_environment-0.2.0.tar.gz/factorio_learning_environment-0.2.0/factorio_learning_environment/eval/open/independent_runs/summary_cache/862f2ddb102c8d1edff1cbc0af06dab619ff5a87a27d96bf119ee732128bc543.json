For example, avoid using callable syntax on objects that are not functions, such as 'Chest' objects.\n\n### Errors when using pickup_entity function\n- When using the pickup_entity function, ensure that the correct parameters are passed, such as specifying the entity type and position correctly.\n\n### Errors with full inventory or destination\n- Regularly check inventories and ensure that chests and other storage entities have space available to avoid mining or production halts.\n- Empty full chests to continue mining operations and avoid warnings like \"chest at drop position is full.\"\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces, are regularly refueled to maintain continuous operation."}
