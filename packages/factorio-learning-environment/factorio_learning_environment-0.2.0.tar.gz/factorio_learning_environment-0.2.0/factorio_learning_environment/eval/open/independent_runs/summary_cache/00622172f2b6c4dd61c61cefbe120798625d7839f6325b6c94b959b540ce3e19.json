{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection System\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) fueled by coal, working status.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) used to collect mined coal, contains 7 units of coal.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the mining drill to the wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) used for storing iron plates, currently empty.\n- **Transport Belt and Inserter System** facilitating movement of items between positions (x=3.5, y=0.5) and (x=5.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal, currently working with copper ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) transferring items from a stone furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) used for storing copper plates, contains 36 copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with entity retrieval by position\n- Verify the existence and type of an entity at a specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors such as \"No entity of type burner-mining-drill found at the specified position.\"\n\n### Errors with attribute access on Position objects\n- Avoid accessing non-existent attributes on Position objects. Ensure that the correct methods or properties are being accessed.\n\n### Errors with inventory inspection\n- Confirm that the entity exists and is of the correct type before inspecting its inventory. This will prevent errors like \"Could not inspect inventory of transport-belt.\"\n\n### Errors with inserter operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path and are not blocked by other entities or full inventories to prevent warnings such as \"inserter waiting for source items\" or \"transport belt at drop position is blocked.\""}
