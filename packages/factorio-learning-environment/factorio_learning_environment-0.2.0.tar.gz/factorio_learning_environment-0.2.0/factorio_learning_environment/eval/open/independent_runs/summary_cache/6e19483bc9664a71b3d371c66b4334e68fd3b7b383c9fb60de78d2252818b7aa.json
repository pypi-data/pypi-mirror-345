{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far from Player\n- Ensure that you are within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from the target position when placing entities. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place entities.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target tile is not occupied by another entity. Adjust the position, spacing, or direction to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Ensure that inserters are fueled and positioned to pick up and drop items correctly.\n\n### Errors with Resource Flow\n- Regularly check that chests and furnaces are receiving the necessary resources. If a furnace is not receiving ore, inspect the inserter setup and ensure that the chest contains enough resources.\n\n### Warnings about Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly empty chests to maintain continuous resource flow.\n\n### Warnings about Inserters Running Out of Fuel\n- Keep inserters fueled to ensure they continue to operate. Regularly check fuel levels and refuel as necessary to prevent interruptions in item transfers."}
