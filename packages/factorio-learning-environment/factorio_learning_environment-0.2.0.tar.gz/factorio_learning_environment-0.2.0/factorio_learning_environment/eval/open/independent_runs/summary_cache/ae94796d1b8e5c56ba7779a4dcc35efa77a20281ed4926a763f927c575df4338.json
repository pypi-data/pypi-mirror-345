Check the fuel inventory of each drill and refill as necessary.\n\n- **Errors when using inserters waiting for items:**\n  - Monitor the status of inserters that are waiting for source items. Ensure that the source chests or machines have sufficient items to avoid delays in operations.\n\n- **Errors when the Stone Furnace has no ingredients:**\n  - Regularly check the input materials for the Stone Furnace. Ensure that iron ore is available for processing to prevent the furnace from becoming idle.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity:**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check the surrounding area for existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No specific utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n  - `wood`: int"}
