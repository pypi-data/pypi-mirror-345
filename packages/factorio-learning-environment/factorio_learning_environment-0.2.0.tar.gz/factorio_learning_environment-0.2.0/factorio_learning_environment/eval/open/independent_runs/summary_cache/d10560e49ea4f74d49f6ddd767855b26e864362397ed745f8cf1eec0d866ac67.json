{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0) with fuel (coal: 10), not connected to any fluid system, warnings: no input liquid, no fluid present in connections.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5), not connected to any fluid system, warnings: no fluid present in connections.\n- Pipe at Position (-46.5, -123.5) as part of the fluid system.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with fuel (coal: 8), warnings: no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with fuel (coal: 45), warnings: no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Additional Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with fuel (coal: 35), warnings: no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5).\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5), not receiving electricity, connected to a small electric pole at Position (5.5, -60.5).\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with automation science pack input, not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups at various positions, all with status EMPTY, indicating no fluid is present.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, voltage is 0 indicating no power is being distributed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the target location before attempting to place a pipe. Adjust the position or remove the obstructing object.\n\n### Offshore Pump Connection Error\n- Verify that the offshore pump is properly connected to a fluid system. Check the alignment and connectivity of pipes and ensure there are no gaps in the fluid network.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole. Verify the electricity network is operational and poles are correctly placed to supply power.\n\n### Boiler and Offshore Pump Connection\n- Ensure that the boiler and offshore pump are correctly connected and aligned to allow fluid flow. Check for any missing connections or misalignments in the setup."}
