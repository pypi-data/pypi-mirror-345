{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Current status: No ingredients to smelt, with 5 iron plates in the result.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5)\n  - Fueled with coal, used to feed iron ore into the stone furnace.\n  - Current status: Waiting for source items, with a pickup position at (-2.5, 0.5) and a drop position at (-0.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to craft or place entities. For example, attempting to place a burner inserter or wooden chest without having them in inventory resulted in errors.\n\n### Errors When Crafting\n- Verify that you have all the required materials before crafting. For instance, attempting to craft a stone furnace without enough stone or a burner inserter without iron gear wheels led to assertion errors.\n\n### Errors When Using Inserters\n- Make sure there is space available at the destination for the inserter to drop items. The inserter was waiting for space in the destination, indicating a blockage that could be resolved by placing a storage chest or another sink object.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and that you have the entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. This was evident when trying to place a wooden chest without having it in inventory."}
