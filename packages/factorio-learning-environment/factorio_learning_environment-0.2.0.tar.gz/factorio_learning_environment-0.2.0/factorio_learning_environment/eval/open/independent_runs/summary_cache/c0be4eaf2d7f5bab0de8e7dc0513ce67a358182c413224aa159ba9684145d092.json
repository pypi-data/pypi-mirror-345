{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed. Multiple attempts were made to position and supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded due to inventory and crafting shortcomings. Although furnaces at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) were used for smelting processes (iron plate and copper plate production, respectively), these were retrieved for processing rather than built as new, connected structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect get_entities usage:\n  \u2013 Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and ensure that the number and type of arguments match the function\u2019s expected signature.\n  \u2013 When using get_entities, validate the return value to handle cases where it may be None before iterating.\n  \n\u2022 Lab placement failures:\n  \u2013 Verify that the lab item exists in inventory before attempting placement.\n  \u2013 Confirm successful crafting of a Lab prior to any placement operations.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient resource and sub-ingredient management in lab crafting:\n  \u2013 Ensure that all required precursor items (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, copper-plates, etc.) are available or can be produced with the available manufacturing and smelting capabilities.\n  \u2013 Monitor resource conversion processes closely to avoid shortages that prevent completion of the lab\u2019s crafting recipe."}
