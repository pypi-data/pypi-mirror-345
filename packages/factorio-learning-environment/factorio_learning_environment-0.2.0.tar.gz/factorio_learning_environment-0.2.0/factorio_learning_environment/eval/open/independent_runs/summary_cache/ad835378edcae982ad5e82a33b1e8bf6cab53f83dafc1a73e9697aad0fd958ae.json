{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nThere are currently no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have been unsuccessful, resulting in an empty map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is buildable before attempting to place an entity. Check for any obstructions or restrictions in the area.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into non-existent or misplaced entities\n- Verify that the target entity exists and is correctly placed before attempting to insert items. Ensure that the entity is within the correct proximity to accept the items.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Confirm that the position is clear and not occupied by another entity before placing a new entity.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operations\n- Ensure that the required resources are available in the inventory before attempting operations that consume resources, such as supplying coal to furnaces.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the intended positions for placing entities and ensure they are within the bounds of the map and free from any global build restrictions."}
