{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to collect iron ore from the drill.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) to collect coal from the drill.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting purposes.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) to transfer coal to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entities in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, make sure you have a burner mining drill or a wooden chest in your inventory before placing them.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required ingredients\n- Check that you have all necessary ingredients before crafting an item. For instance, ensure you have enough iron plates and iron gear wheels for crafting a burner mining drill, and gather raw resources like stone and wood as they cannot be crafted.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with collision\n- Verify that there is enough space and no collision with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider adjusting the placement direction or position to avoid conflicts with nearby structures, such as furnaces or chests."}
