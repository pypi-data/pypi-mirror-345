{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled intermittently with coal\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, currently fueled with coal but lacking ingredients\n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5) moving items between drill, furnace, assembling machine, and chest; all currently out of fuel\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, but not receiving power\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels\n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections, but power is not reaching the assembler or inserters\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by an electric pole. However, the assembling machine is not powered and several burner inserters are out of fuel, causing production halts.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power\n- The assembling machine 2 is still not powered despite electric poles being placed.\n- Verify that electric poles are correctly connected in a continuous power network covering the assembler and all inserters.\n- Check that the electric poles themselves are powered and that no gaps exist in the power grid.\n- Ensure the assembler\u2019s connection points align with poles and that no obstructions or incorrect pole types are used.\n\n### Errors due to burner inserters running out of fuel\n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5) report being out of fuel, causing them to stop moving items.\n- Regularly insert coal or other fuel into burner inserters to keep them operational.\n- Consider switching to electric inserters powered by the electric poles to avoid fuel management issues.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into inserters despite having coal in inventory\n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into burner inserters fail with \"No coal to insert from your inventory\" exceptions, even though coal was harvested and inventory shows coal.\n- This indicates a possible timing or inventory state synchronization issue; ensure coal is properly transferred to the player inventory before attempting insertion.\n- Avoid redundant or repeated insert attempts without confirming successful previous insertion.\n- Implement checks to verify inventory contents immediately before insertion calls.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage and no sink entity\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0, 71.0) and burner inserter at (23.5, 73.5) report output blocked by items on the ground due to no sink entity accepting outputs.\n- Confirm that inserters and chests are correctly positioned and connected to accept outputs from drills and assemblers.\n- Ensure inserters have fuel and are operational to move items away, preventing blockage.\n\n### General placement and fuel management tips (from previous report)\n- Confirm entity placement tiles are free and not occupied before placing inserters or assembling machines.\n- Verify inventory contains required entities before placement attempts.\n- Use inserters between furnaces and belts; do not connect belts directly to furnaces.\n- Regularly check power network connectivity and energy levels of electric entities to avoid production halts.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
