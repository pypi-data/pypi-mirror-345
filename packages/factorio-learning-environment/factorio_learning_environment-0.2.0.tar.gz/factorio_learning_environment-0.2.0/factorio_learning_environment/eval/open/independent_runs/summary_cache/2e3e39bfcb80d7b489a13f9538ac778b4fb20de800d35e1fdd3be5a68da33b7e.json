{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from the target position before placing any entity. Move closer to the intended placement location.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with potential collisions\n- Before placing an entity, check for any existing entities or obstacles that might block placement. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors when inserters are not correctly aligned or fueled\n- Verify that inserters are properly aligned with both the source and destination entities. Ensure that inserters are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when furnaces are not receiving ingredients\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly transferring materials from the chest to the furnace. Ensure that the chest contains sufficient resources for the inserter to transfer."}
