{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Structure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. \n  - Pickup position: (x=-16.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position to facilitate the transfer of items. Misalignment will result in failed item transfers and assertion errors.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Refueling\n- Verify that there is sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel an inserter. Lack of coal will prevent the inserter from operating.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to operate. Check the inserter setup and alignment to resolve any issues with ingredient transfer."}
