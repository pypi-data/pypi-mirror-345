{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), which is connected to a pipe system that transports water.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) which is currently out of ingredients to smelt.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 1.5) containing iron plates.\n- Furnace (position 10.0, 1.0) which is out of fuel and has iron ore as input.\n- Burner Inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) which is out of fuel and connects the lab and furnace.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 3.5) containing iron plates.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 5.5) which is empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any obstacles, including other entities or unplaceable terrain (like water).\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position. If an entity type is not found, check if it has been placed correctly or if it has been removed.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The issues with placing electric poles and retrieving the steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0) have been consistently reported across multiple steps. Ensure to check the environment and the existence of entities before attempting these actions again."}
