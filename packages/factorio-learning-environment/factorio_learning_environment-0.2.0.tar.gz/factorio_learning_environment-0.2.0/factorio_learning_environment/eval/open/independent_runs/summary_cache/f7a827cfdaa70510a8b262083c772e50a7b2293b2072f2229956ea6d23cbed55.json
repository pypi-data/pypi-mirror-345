{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the existing structures and error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at (0,0)\nConsists of three furnaces in a row:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0)\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) \n- Furnace 3 at (4,4)\nAll furnaces are processing copper ore into copper plates and are coal-powered\n\n### Automated Assembly Line at (6.5-16.5, 11.5)\nComplex production line consisting of:\n- Input chest at (6.5, 11.5) containing iron plates\n- Burner inserter at (7.5, 11.5) moving materials\n- Assembling machine at (9.5, 11.5) producing copper cables\n- Burner inserter at (11.5, 11.5) handling output\n- Three storage chests at (12.5, 14.5, 16.5, y=11.5) containing various materials including iron plates, copper cables and electronic circuits\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5 to -3.5, 24.5)\nSteam-based power plant consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting components\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at (-3.5, 24.5)\n- Connected to electrical grid with multiple poles\n\n### Research Facility at (0.5, 28.5-31.5)\nScience pack handling system with:\n- Storage chest at (0.5, 31.5) containing science packs\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 30.5) feeding lab\n- Lab (position implied from inserter configuration)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Blocked Output Errors\n- Clear blocked items from the ground regularly to prevent inserter jams\n- Ensure there is always a valid destination entity for inserter outputs\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels closely - there was one instance where coal ran out for furnace operation\n- Keep sufficient fuel in burner inserters and boilers to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Space Management\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to allow for inserter operation\n- Maintain clear paths for item transport between production facilities"}
