{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) facilitating transfer between entities\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-19.5, -61.5) facilitating transfer between entities\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (0.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Assembling Machine at position (2.5, 0.5) and inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) that puts into the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) to the assembling machine at position (2.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Entity Type Assertion\n- Ensure that the entity type matches the expected prototype before asserting. For example, verify that the entity is a 'BurnerInserter' before performing operations specific to that type.\n\n### Errors with Non-callable Objects\n- Avoid attempting to call objects that are not functions or callable entities. Ensure that the entity you are trying to interact with is designed to be callable.\n\n### Handling Full Inventory Warnings\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of entities like chests and furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all burner entities have a sufficient fuel supply to maintain continuous operation. Regularly refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces to avoid production stoppages.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items and that the source entities are not empty or blocked. Adjust the setup to ensure smooth item flow between entities."}
