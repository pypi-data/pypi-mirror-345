{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures present on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but no successful placements have been recorded. The map remains empty of any constructed structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest, Iron Chest, Burner Inserter, Stone Furnace, and Transport Belt**: Ensure that the placement area is not obstructed and that there are no hidden constraints or map-wide restrictions. Verify that the tile is suitable for the intended entity and that no other entities occupy the space.\n\n### Errors related to movement\n- **Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'**: This error suggests an incorrect handling of data types during movement operations. Ensure that indices used for accessing elements are integers and that the data structure being accessed supports integer indexing.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Global Constraints and Map Restrictions**: Before attempting to place entities, check for any global constraints or map-specific restrictions that might prevent placement. This will help in identifying potential issues beforehand and adjusting the strategy accordingly."}
