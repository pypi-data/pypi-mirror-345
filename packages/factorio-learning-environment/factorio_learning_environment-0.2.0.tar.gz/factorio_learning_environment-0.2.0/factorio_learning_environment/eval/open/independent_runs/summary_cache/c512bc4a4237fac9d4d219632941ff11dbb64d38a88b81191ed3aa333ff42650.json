{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\n- **Chest** at position (x=-27.5, y=-59.5) for storing mined resources\n- **Coal chest** at position (x=-28.5, y=-62.5) for storing coal used as fuel\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting or extracting coal\n- **Failed to insert coal**: Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the mining drill or chest.\n- **Failed to extract coal**: Verify that the coal chest contains coal before attempting to extract it.\n- **Failed to transfer coal**: Ensure the coal chest is not empty and the target chest has space before transferring coal.\n\n#### Errors related to mining drill operation\n- **Mining drill out of fuel**: Ensure the mining drill is fueled with coal to continue operation.\n- **Chest at drop position is full**: Empty the chest at (x=-27.5, y=-59.5) to allow the mining drill to continue mining.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **extract_coal()**: Attempts to extract coal from the coal chest. Fails if the coal chest is empty.\n- **insert_coal()**: Attempts to insert coal into the mining drill or chest. Fails if no coal is in the inventory.\n- **transfer_coal()**: Attempts to transfer coal from the coal chest to another chest. Fails if the coal chest is empty or the target chest is full.\n\n#### Variables\n- **coal_chest**: Position (x=-28.5, y=-62.5), type: Chest, contains coal.\n- **mining_drill**: Position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0), type: Burner Mining Drill, status: NO_FUEL.\n- **resource_chest**: Position (x=-27.5, y=-59.5), type: Chest, currently empty."}
