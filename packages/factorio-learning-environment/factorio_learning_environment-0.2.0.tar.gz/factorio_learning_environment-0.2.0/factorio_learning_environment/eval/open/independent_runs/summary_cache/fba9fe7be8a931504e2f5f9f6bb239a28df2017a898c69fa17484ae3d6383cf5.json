{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-14.5, 20.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-4.5, 22.5) and (-1.5, 22.5) (not connected)\n- Boiler at position (-14.5, 20.0) and (-11.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boilers\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnaces at positions (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), and (-13.5, -45.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5), and (-9.5, -43.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Transport Belts connecting furnaces, chests, and inserters\n\n### Belt Group\n- Connects various entities, facilitating the movement of iron plates between furnaces and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connections\n- Ensure that steam engines are correctly positioned and aligned with the boilers and connected using pipes or underground pipes. Verify the fluid connections to ensure steam engines receive the necessary input liquid.\n\n### Errors when Refueling Boilers\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to avoid failed refueling attempts. Regularly check and replenish coal stocks to keep boilers operational.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. Regularly transfer items from full chests to maintain production flow.\n\n### Errors when Using Pipes\n- Confirm that pipes and underground pipes are correctly placed and connected to form a continuous path between the offshore pump, boilers, and steam engines. Check for any missing or misplaced pipes that could disrupt the fluid flow."}
