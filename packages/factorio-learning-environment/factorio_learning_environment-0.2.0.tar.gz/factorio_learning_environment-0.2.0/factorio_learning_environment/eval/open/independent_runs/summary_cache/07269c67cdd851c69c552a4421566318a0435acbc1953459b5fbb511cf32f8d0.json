{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump (position -10.5, 25.5) is working and connected to pipes.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=63624, fluid=water, position -10.5, 23.5) is full output with several connected pipes.\n\n### Boiler at position(-34.5, 30.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -34.5, 30.0) is not connected and has no input liquid.\n\n### Steam Engine at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine (position -29.5, 30.5) is not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### Lab at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position x) is not powered.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at various positions.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using attributes that do not exist\n- Ensure that the attributes you are trying to access on an object exist. For example, the `PipeGroup` object does not have a `fluid_system` attribute. Check the documentation or the object definition before accessing properties.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect entities\n- When connecting entities, ensure that the positions are valid and that the entities can indeed be connected. For example, the connection attempt between the offshore pump and boiler failed due to invalid positions. Verify the coordinates and ensure they are within the connection range.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
