{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=3.0, y=1.0)\n\nThese furnaces are used for smelting copper ore into copper plates. However, they are currently out of fuel and have no ingredients to smelt, as indicated by their status.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Copper Cables\n- Ensure that you have the required sub-ingredients before attempting to craft an item. Copper cables require copper plates, which must be smelted in a furnace or crafted using a machine. Verify that you have the necessary copper plates in your inventory or that your furnaces are operational and producing copper plates.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert items into a furnace or any other entity, confirm that you have the required items in your inventory. This includes ensuring you have enough coal or copper ore before trying to insert them into a furnace.\n\n### Errors When Furnaces Are Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in your furnaces to ensure they are operational. If a furnace is out of fuel, it will not be able to smelt ores into plates. Keep a steady supply of coal or another fuel source to maintain continuous operation."}
