{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists solely of a stone furnace that now processes both iron ore and copper ore. It smelts copper ore into copper plates (as evidenced by the production and extraction of copper plates for further crafting) and continues to smelt iron ore into iron plates for pipe production and other needs.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 2.5)\nConsists solely of the wooden chest entity used for inventory storage and management, unchanged from previous reports.\n\n### Laboratory Complex with Associated Power and Connection Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (10.5, 10.5) used for research and associated inventory management.\n- SteamEngine at position (8.5, 10.5) serving as a power generator.\n- SmallElectricPole at position (12.5, 10.5) placed to create an intermediate connection.\n- Extra SmallElectricPole at position (10.5, 8.5) placed to further complete the connection network.\nThe small poles and steam engine are interconnected to maintain a stable power grid for the laboratory operations.\n\n### Boiler and Pipe Connection System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler placed at an alternate location (11.5, 14.0) used for fueling the boiler system with coal.\n- Pipe connection between the boiler and the SteamEngine (connection aimed from approximately (11.5, 12.5) to (8.5, 13.5)), enabled after crafting the required pipes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Furnace Extraction and Insertion Errors\n  - Ensure that inventory manipulation functions are called with proper object types. An extraction attempt on a string instead of an entity caused an AttributeError.\n  - Before inserting a new ore type into the furnace, clear the existing inventory to avoid conflicts between previously processed materials.\n\n\u2022 Tile Occupancy and Placement Collisions\n  - Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing entities. This is essential when placing small-electric-poles or boilers to avoid collision errors.\n  - Use alternate placement strategies (e.g., nearest buildable position) when the original target location is obstructed.\n\n\u2022 Connection and Linking Failures Between Entities\n  - When connecting power components, ensure that reference entities (e.g., small-electric-poles) exist at the expected positions to prevent nil index errors.\n  - For pipe connections, confirm that the necessary sub-ingredients are available prior to using connection functions. Addressing crafting shortages (such as insufficient iron-plates for pipe production) is crucial.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Prerequisites and Sub-Ingredient Shortages\n  - Maintain an adequate supply of required sub-ingredients (like iron-plates) to prevent crafting failures. Plan for smelting additional resources when necessary.\n  - Monitor inventory levels closely after extraction and insertion actions to support continuous crafting without interruption."}
