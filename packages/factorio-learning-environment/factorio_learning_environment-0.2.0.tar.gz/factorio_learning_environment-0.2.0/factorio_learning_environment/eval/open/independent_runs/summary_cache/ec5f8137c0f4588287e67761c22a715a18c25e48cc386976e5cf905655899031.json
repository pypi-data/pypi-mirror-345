For instance, empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n### Errors due to inserters out of fuel\n- Ensure inserters have sufficient fuel to maintain continuous operation. Regularly refuel inserters to avoid stoppages.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces having no ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to avoid downtime. Regularly check and supply necessary ingredients to furnaces."}
