{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis facility extracts iron ore from the mining drill, stores it in the chest, and then transfers it to the furnace for smelting into iron plates. The burner inserter facilitates the transfer of materials between the chest and the furnace.\n\n### Coal Processing Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis facility extracts coal from the mining drill, stores it in the chest, and then transfers it to the furnace for processing. The burner inserter aids in moving coal from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Always check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to insufficient items for insertion."}
