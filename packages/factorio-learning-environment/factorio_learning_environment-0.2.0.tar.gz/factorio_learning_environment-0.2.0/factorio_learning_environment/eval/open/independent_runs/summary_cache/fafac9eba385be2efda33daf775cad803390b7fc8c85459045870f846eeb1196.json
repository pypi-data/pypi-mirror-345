{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chest\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) for storing copper plates\n\n### Transport and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserters at positions (3.5, 6.5, and 8.5, 0.5) for moving items along the production line\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, 0.5) for intermediate storage of iron and copper plates\n- BeltGroup connecting various inserters and chests to facilitate item movement\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (chests or furnaces) connected to the inserters have sufficient items to transfer. Regularly check and refuel or restock these sources to keep the production line moving.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Verify that the destination entities (usually chests) have enough space to accommodate incoming items. Clear out or expand storage as needed to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors with Missing Wooden Chests\n- Before attempting to access or interact with a wooden chest, confirm its existence at the specified position. If missing, place a new chest or update the position reference.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Inserters and Belts\n- Regularly check and clear any blockages in the inserter and belt systems to ensure smooth item flow. This includes removing excess items from chests and ensuring belts are not obstructed."}
