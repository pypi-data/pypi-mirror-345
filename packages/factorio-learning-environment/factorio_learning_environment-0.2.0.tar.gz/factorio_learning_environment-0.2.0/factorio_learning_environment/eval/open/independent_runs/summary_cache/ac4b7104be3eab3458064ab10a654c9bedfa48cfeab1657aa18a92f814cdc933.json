{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Smelting: Iron ore (19 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5)\n  - Transfers iron plates from the furnace to the chest\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron plates (16 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (4.5, 0.5)\n  - Transfers iron plates from the belt to the chest\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied\n- Ensure there is sufficient space and no existing entities or obstacles at the target position before attempting to place a new entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities improperly\n- When connecting entities like belts, ensure that the connection is valid. Belts cannot connect directly to chests; use an inserter to facilitate the transfer of items into a chest.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Before attempting to place or craft items, ensure that the necessary items or resources are available in the inventory. For example, ensure you have burner inserters or transport belts before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Verify that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting transport belts requires iron plates, which should be available in sufficient quantity.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without required inventory\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the items you intend to insert into another entity. For instance, inserting iron ore into a furnace requires having iron ore in your inventory."}
