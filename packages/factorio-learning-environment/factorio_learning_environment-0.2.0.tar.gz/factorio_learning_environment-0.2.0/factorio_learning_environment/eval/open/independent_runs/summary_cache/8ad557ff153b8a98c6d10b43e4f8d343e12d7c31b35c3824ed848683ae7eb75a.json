Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring items effectively.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal when low.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. Running out of items like coal can disrupt operations.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting. Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly configured to transfer items from the chest to the furnace."}
