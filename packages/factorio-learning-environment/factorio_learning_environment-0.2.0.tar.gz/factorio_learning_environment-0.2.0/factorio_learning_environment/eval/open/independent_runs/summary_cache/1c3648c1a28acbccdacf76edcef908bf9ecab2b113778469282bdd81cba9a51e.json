{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line at (8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (x=8.5, y=13.5)\n- Output inserter (x=10.5, y=13.5) and chest (x=11.5, y=13.5)\n- Iron gear input inserter (x=7.5, y=16.5) and chest (x=7.5, y=17.5)\n- Copper plate input inserter (x=9.5, y=18.5) and chest (x=9.5, y=19.5)\n- Connected to electricity network\n\n### Power Generation System around (-4.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (x=-4.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler (x=-4.5, y=16.0) with coal fuel\n- Offshore pump (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Connected pipe networks for water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting various entities\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups:\n1. Setup at (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) with coal storage\n   - Inserter (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\n2. Setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest and inserter system (x=-27.5, y=-59.5)\n   - Stone furnace (x=-25.0, y=-59.0)\n   - Output inserter and chest system\n\n3. Setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Input chest and inserter system\n   - Stone furnace (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n   - Output inserter and chest containing iron plates\n\n### Transport Infrastructure\n- Belt system starting at (8.5, 11.5) running to (1.5, 16.5)\n- Multiple pipe networks for fluid transport\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a location\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, ensure proper spacing and direction\n- Consider using different directions or positions if initial placement fails due to collisions\n\n### Direction Errors\n- Use only valid direction enums (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) instead of invalid ones like NORTHWEST\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into containers\n- Craft necessary buildings (like stone furnaces) before attempting to place them\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Keep mining drills fueled to prevent \"out of fuel\" warnings\n- Ensure proper connection of fluid networks for boiler and steam engine operations\n- Check assembling machine input requirements are met to prevent ingredient shortages\n\n### Inserter Setup\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions are valid and unobstructed\n- Ensure proper spacing between inserters and their target entities"}
