{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and Steam Engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Storage and Logistics\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) storing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions, primarily empty, indicating potential future fluid transport routes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities without Required Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like electric poles. This will prevent connection failures due to missing items.\n\n### Errors with Power Network Connections\n- Verify that all components of your power network are properly connected and have the necessary input fluids. This includes ensuring that boilers have water and steam engines are connected to the power network.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full output destinations.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source to function correctly. Check the power network connections and resolve any disconnections."}
