{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and places it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace. The inserter is currently misaligned, causing issues with iron ore transfer.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. Misalignment will prevent the inserter from picking up items.\n- Double-check the inserter's drop position to ensure it aligns with the intended target (e.g., the furnace).\n\n### Errors when Refueling or Inserting Items\n- Verify that there are sufficient resources in your inventory before attempting to refuel or insert items into entities. Lack of resources will result in failed operations.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly transferring ingredients to the furnace. Misalignment or incorrect configuration can lead to the furnace not receiving the necessary materials for smelting."}
