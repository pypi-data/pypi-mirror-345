{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) and a Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) connected to a transport belt system for copper ore transportation.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-24.5, y=-65.5) and (x=-24.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-65.5) for copper ore movement.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal collection.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters\n- Ensure there is an unoccupied tile available before attempting to place an inserter. Check for existing objects that might obstruct placement.\n\n### Errors when no suitable position is found for placing entities\n- Verify that the target area is clear of obstacles and that the position is suitable for the entity type you are trying to place. Consider repositioning or clearing the area if necessary.\n\n### Errors related to fuel and ingredients\n- Regularly check the fuel status of drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process materials."}
