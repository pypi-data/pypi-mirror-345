{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace Processing Unit at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore and copper ore. (Current state: fuel remaining coal: 31, output available; continues to warn \u201cno ingredients to smelt\u201d.)\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects output from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (48.5, -81.5) that supplies items to subsequent connections. (Updated fuel status: 10 coal inserted; status remains waiting for source items.)\n- Belt group connecting the burner inserter to the chest comprising:\n  - Transport belt piece placed at position (49.5, -80.5) bridging the connection.\n  - Additional belt segment forming a continuous link from (x=49.5, y=-79.5) to (x=49.5, y=-81.5).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Connection Failures\n- Validate target positions for all placements and connections to ensure tiles are buildable and unoccupied, particularly in transport belt constructions.\n- Confirm connectivity between linked entities by verifying reference positions prior to initiating connection operations.\n\n### API Reference and Inventory Handling Consistency\n- Ensure proper import and definition of required API classes to prevent reference errors.\n- Check container inventories immediately after entity replacements or insertions to maintain accurate inventory tracking."}
