{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Transport Belts at positions (41.5, -84.5), (41.5, -83.5), and (41.5, -82.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (42.5, -80.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions for transport of materials\n\n### Coal Supply System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5)\n- BeltGroup for coal transport connecting positions (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5) and (54.5, -86.5) to (52.5, -82.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is a suitable and unoccupied position before attempting to place entities such as inserters and chests. Clear any obstructions or choose a different location.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that there is a valid sink entity or destination for outputs from drills and inserters to prevent blockage. Regularly check and clear any items blocking the output path.\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Verify that inserters have a clear path to pick up and drop items. Ensure that the entities they interact with are correctly positioned and not full."}
