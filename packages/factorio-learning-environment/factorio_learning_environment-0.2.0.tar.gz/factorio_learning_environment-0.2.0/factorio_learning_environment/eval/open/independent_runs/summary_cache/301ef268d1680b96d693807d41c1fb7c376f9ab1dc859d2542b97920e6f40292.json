{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Connected Pipes forming PipeGroup with steam and water systems\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) processing copper ore\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) moving items from Stone Furnace to Wooden Chest\n\n### Storage and Inventory Management\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) storing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science pack, currently not in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, inserting coal into a furnace failed due to lack of coal in inventory.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Power Network\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network. The connection of small electric poles failed due to missing items.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check fuel levels in entities like boilers and furnaces to avoid warnings such as \"out of fuel\" or \"no ingredients to smelt.\" Ensure that fuel is available and inserted timely to maintain operations.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement and Connection\n- Ensure that all entities are properly connected to their respective networks. For instance, reconnect pipes if a boiler is not connected properly to maintain the flow of resources."}
