{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed due to various constraints and issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another entity or restricted by the game settings before attempting to place an entity.\n- Verify that there are no global constraints or map-wide restrictions affecting the placement of entities.\n- Check for hidden constraints or persistent issues that may prevent the placement of specific entities like Wooden Chests, Iron Chests, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts.\n- Confirm that the game settings and restrictions allow for the placement of the intended entity type in the chosen location.\n\n### Errors related to incorrect data handling\n- Ensure that data types are correctly handled, such as using integer indices when required, to avoid errors like \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'\"."}
