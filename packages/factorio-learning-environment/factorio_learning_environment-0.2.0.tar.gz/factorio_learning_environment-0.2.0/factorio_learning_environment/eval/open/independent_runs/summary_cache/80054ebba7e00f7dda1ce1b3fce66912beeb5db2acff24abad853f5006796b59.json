{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is responsible for generating electricity, while the boiler heats water using fuel, and the offshore pump extracts water from the sea.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to offshore pump\n- Ensure that the positions of the boiler and offshore pump are correctly aligned and within the range for pipe connections. Check the distances and angles to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the intended placement area."}
