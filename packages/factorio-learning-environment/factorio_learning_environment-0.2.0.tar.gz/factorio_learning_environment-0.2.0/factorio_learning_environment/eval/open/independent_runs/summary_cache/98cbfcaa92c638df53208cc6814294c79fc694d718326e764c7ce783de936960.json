{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Line at y=0.0\nConsists of four stone furnaces in a row with partial automation:\n- Furnace at x=0.0 (contains coal, has 7 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=-1.5 y=0.5 for coal input\n  - Has burner inserter at x=0.5 y=-1.5 for ore input\n- Furnace at x=2.0 (contains coal, has 7 iron plates)\n- Furnace at x=4.0 (contains coal, has 15 iron plates)\n- Furnace at x=6.0 (contains coal, has 15 iron plates)\n\nAll furnaces are currently idle due to lack of ore input.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Resource availability errors\n- Check inventory for required resources before attempting to insert items into entities\n- Ensure you have both fuel (coal) and raw materials (ore) before setting up multiple furnaces\n- Consider harvesting more resources when inventory is depleted instead of continuing to place empty structures\n\n### Furnace efficiency\n- Avoid placing furnaces without having resources ready to fuel and supply them\n- Set up furnaces one at a time, ensuring each is properly supplied before moving to the next one\n- When extracting products from furnaces, immediately resupply them with raw materials to maintain continuous production\n- Monitor furnace warnings like 'no ingredients to smelt' and address them promptly to maintain production efficiency\n\n### Inventory management\n- Keep track of extracted items - logs show \"Total iron plates collected: 0\" despite extracting 44 plates\n- Verify successful extraction operations by checking inventory contents before and after extraction\n\n### Entity placement and retrieval errors\n- Verify that an entity exists at a position before attempting to interact with it\n- When trying to get an entity (like wooden chest), ensure it has been placed first\n- Double check coordinates when attempting to interact with entities\n\n### Automation setup\n- When setting up automation, ensure all required components (chests, inserters, etc.) are placed before attempting to configure them\n- Verify that inserters have proper pickup and drop positions that align with intended source and destination entities"}
