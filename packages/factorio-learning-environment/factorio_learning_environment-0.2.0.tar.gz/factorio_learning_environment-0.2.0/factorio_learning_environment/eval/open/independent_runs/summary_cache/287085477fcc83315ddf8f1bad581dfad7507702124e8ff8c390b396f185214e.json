{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working but the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). These furnaces are fueled by coal and are currently working to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to the chest being full.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials (iron ore) to avoid interruptions in smelting operations.\n\n### Coal Insertion Error\n- Always check your inventory for available coal before attempting to insert it into furnaces or drills. This will prevent errors related to insufficient coal supply.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int)`: Handles the insertion of items into entities. Ensure the inventory has the required items before calling this function to avoid insertion errors.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `furnace`: Represents a furnace entity for item insertion.\n  - `coal_to_insert`: Integer representing the quantity of coal intended for insertion.\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary representing the player's current inventory status."}
