{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities from positions (-4.5, 22.5) to (0.5, 22.5) and (-7.5, 24.5) to (1.5, 24.5)\n\n### Smelting Area\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates and copper plates\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to small electric poles and other entities\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack at position (not specified), status: no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Code Execution\n- Ensure that all necessary classes and modules are imported and defined before usage to avoid `NameError`. For example, the `Entity` class must be defined or imported before being referenced.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Before attempting to connect pipes, ensure that the path is clear of any blockages to prevent placement blockage errors. Check the surrounding area for any obstructions that might prevent successful connection.\n\n### Errors in Power Supply\n- Verify that all electrical entities, such as inserters, are connected to a power network to ensure they receive electricity. Check connections to small electric poles and ensure they are part of a complete circuit."}
