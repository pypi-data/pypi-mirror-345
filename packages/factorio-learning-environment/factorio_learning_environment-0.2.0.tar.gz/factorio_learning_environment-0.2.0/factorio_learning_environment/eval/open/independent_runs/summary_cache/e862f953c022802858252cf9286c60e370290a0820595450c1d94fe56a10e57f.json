{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Ore Processing Line at (-2.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-2.0, y=-76.0)\n- Iron chest (x=-1.5, y=-74.5)\n- Stone furnace (x=0.0, y=-77.0)\nThe mining drill is operational and connected to the chest which contains iron ore. An attempt was made to connect the chest to furnace with an inserter but failed.\n\n###Copper/Iron Processing Line at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-21.0, y=-73.0)\n- Iron chest (x=-21.5, y=-74.5)\n- Burner inserter (x=-20.5, y=-74.5)\n- Stone furnace (x=-19.0, y=-74.0)\nThe mining drill is currently out of fuel. The furnace contains some copper plates as output.\n\n###Standalone Furnace Group at (3.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (x=3.0, y=-73.0)\n- Stone furnace (x=5.0, y=-73.0)\nBoth furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to process.\n\n###Miscellaneous Components\n- Standalone burner inserter at (x=-1.5, y=-72.5), currently out of fuel\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Errors with inserter placement\n- The place_entity_next_to function requires proper parameter formatting\n- Ensure correct syntax when specifying source and target entities for inserter connections\n\n###Entity positioning issues\n- An inserter was placed incorrectly and had to be cleaned up\n- Verify the positioning logic before placing entities to ensure they can properly interact with connected structures\n\n###Fuel management issues\n- Multiple entities are running out of fuel (mining drill and inserter)\n- Implement regular fuel checking and refilling for all burner-type entities\n\n###Process flow issues\n- Several furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to process\n- Ensure proper connection and material flow between mining, storage, and processing structures"}
