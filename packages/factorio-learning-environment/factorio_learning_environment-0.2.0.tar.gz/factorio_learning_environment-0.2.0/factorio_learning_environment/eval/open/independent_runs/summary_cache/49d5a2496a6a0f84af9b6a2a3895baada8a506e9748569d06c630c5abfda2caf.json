{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0).\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected via transport belts to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Storage at Position (-23.5, -69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage at Position (-12.5, -54.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Small Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items to a Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups connecting various entities across the map:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5) and (-21.5, -67.5) to (-21.5, -69.5).\n- Additional BeltGroups connecting various positions, facilitating item transport across the facilities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connection\n- Ensure continuous placement of belts without gaps. Verify the alignment and connectivity of belts between positions (-20.5, -67.5) and (-21.5, -66.5) to avoid gaps.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for inserters contains items to be transferred. Check the inventory of source chests or belts feeding into inserters to ensure they are not empty.\n\n### Furnaces with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply lines feeding into furnaces to ensure they are stocked with raw materials."}
