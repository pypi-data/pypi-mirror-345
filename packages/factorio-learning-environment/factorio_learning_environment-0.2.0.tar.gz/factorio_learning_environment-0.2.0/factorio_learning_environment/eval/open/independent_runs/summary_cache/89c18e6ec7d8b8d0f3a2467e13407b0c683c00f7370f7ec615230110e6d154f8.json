{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures established on the map. The agent attempted to place several entities such as burner mining drills, stone furnaces, and assembling machines, but these actions were unsuccessful due to missing items in the inventory. Therefore, no structures have been successfully created or placed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory\n- Ensure that all required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities like burner mining drills, stone furnaces, or assembling machines. Craft or gather necessary resources in advance.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required resources\n- Before crafting items such as iron gear wheels, automation science packs, assembling machines, copper cables, or electronic circuits, verify that all required ingredients are available. Plan resource gathering and crafting activities to ensure all necessary components are on hand.\n\n### Errors when crafting requiring specific equipment\n- Crafting certain items, such as iron plates, requires specific equipment like a furnace. Ensure that the appropriate crafting machines or smelting facilities are available and operational before attempting to craft these items.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without availability\n- Check that the items you intend to insert into entities are present in your inventory. For example, ensure copper ore is available before attempting to insert it into a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placing the desired entity. If an entity cannot be placed, check the tile's status and ensure it is clear."}
