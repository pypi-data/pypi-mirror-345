{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the steam engine and boiler with positions ranging from (x=20.5, y=-10.5) to (x=20.5, y=-5.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=22.5, y=-4.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=20.0, y=20.0) with a drop position at (x=19.5, y=18.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) with a drop position at (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) that puts into the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace to the assembling machine with belts positioned from (x=10.5, y=4.5) to (x=7.5, y=6.5)\n\n### Iron Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- Inserter at position (x=7.5, y=5.5) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=8.5, y=5.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, the attempt to place a wooden chest at (19.5, 18.5) failed due to the absence of a wooden chest in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Make sure there is a sink entity or space available for the output of mining drills to prevent blockage. The burner mining drill at (x=20.0, y=20.0) is waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Errors due to fuel shortages\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers and burner mining drills to prevent them from stopping operations. The boiler at (x=20.5, y=-4.0) and burner mining drill at (x=-11.0, y=20.0) are out of fuel.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for production processes. The assembling machine at (x=10.5, y=0.5) is unable to create copper cable due to missing copper plates."}
