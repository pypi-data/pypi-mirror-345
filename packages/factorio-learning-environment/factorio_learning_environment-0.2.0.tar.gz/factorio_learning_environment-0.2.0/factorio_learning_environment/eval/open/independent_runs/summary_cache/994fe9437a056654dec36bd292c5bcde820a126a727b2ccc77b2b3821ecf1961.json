{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-39\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. The agent attempted to reconfigure the boiler fueling system but encountered issues. The original chest and inserter for coal were removed. A pipe segment connecting the boiler to the steam engine was also removed and attempts to replace it failed. Currently, the boiler is out of fuel and the steam engine is not receiving steam or connected to the power network.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water. Status: `WORKING`.\n*   **Pipe Group** from Position(x=-8.5, y=-0.5) to Position(x=-4.5, y=0.5): Transports water to the boiler. Status: `FULL_OUTPUT`.\n*   **Boiler** at Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5): Heats water into steam using coal. Status: `NO_FUEL`. Steam output at Position(x=-6.5, y=2.5).\n*   **Pipe Group** from Position(x=-6.5, y=3.5) to Position(x=-2.5, y=6.5): Intended to transport steam to the engine, but currently disconnected from the boiler output and empty. Status: `EMPTY`.\n*   **Steam Engine** at Position(x=0.5, y=6.5): Consumes steam to generate electricity. Status: `NOT_CONNECTED` (No input fluid, not connected to power network). Fluid input at Position(x=-2.0, y=6.5).\n*   **Electricity Poles** (various positions): Distribute power. Part of ElectricityGroup ID 148092, but currently has 0 voltage as the generator is offline.\n\n### Coal Mine at Position(x=17.5, y=1.5)\nThis structure mines coal and places it into a chest. It is currently not powered.\n*   **Electric Mining Drill** at Position(x=17.5, y=1.5): Mines coal. Status"}
