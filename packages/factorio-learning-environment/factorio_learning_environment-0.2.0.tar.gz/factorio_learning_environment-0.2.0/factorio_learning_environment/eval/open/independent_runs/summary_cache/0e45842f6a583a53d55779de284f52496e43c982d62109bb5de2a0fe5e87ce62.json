{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner mining drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is currently working and requires coal for operation.\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which is being used to store coal, but is currently full and needs to be emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n### Wooden chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which stores coal. The current inventory shows 82 coal remaining.\n\n### Stone furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently not operational due to lack of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when the wooden chest is full**\n  - The burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) cannot continue mining because the wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) is full. Regularly check and empty the chest to ensure continuous operation of the mining drill.\n  \n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Ensure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This will prevent unnecessary delays and ensure efficient resource gathering.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check the surrounding area to avoid conflicts with existing structures.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None invoked.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `coal`: int (total amount of coal collected)\n  - `wood`: int (total amount of wood collected)\n  - `iron-ore`: int (total amount of iron ore collected)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (total amount of iron plates collected)\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: dict (inventory of the wooden chest)"}
