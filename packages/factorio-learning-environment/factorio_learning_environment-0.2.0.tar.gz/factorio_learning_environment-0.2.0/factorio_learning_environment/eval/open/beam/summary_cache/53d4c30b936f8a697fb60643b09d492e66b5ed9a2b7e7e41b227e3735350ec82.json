{"content": "I can now analyze the interaction patterns and provide a report based on our attempts:\n\nANALYSIS REPORT:\n\n1. Current Inventory Status:\n- We consistently have: transport belts (39), burner inserter (1), stone furnace (1-2), coal (70), stone (5), iron plate (1)\n- We lack: burner mining drills, iron chests\n\n2. Map Analysis:\n- There's an iron chest at (-15.5, 21.5) containing 288 iron ore\n- Multiple furnaces and inserters are already placed on the map\n- Iron ore patch located at approximately (-19.5, 19.5)\n\n3. Attempted Actions & Outcomes:\n- Successfully placed burner inserters\n- Successfully added coal as fuel to inserters\n- Failed to place iron chests (not in inventory)\n- Failed to place burner mining drills (not in inventory)\n- Successfully placed transport belts\n\n4. Common Errors:\n- \"No iron_chest in inventory\"\n- \"No burner_mining_drill in inventory\"\n- \"No iron-ore to insert\"\n\n5. Successful Patterns:\n- Placing and fueling inserters works consistently\n- Transport belt placement is reliable\n- Coal insertion as fuel works well\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. Focus on Working with Available Resources:\n- Use the existing iron chest as a source\n- Utilize transport belts we have in inventory\n- Make use of our single burner inserter effectively\n\n2. Optimal Setup Pattern:\n```python\n# Place inserter\ninserter = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerInserter, Direction.UP, position)\n# Add fuel immediately\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n```\n\n3. Future Improvements:\n- Need to acquire burner mining drills\n- Need to acquire additional iron chests\n- Should establish a way to get more iron ore\n\n4. Best Practices:\n- Always check inventory before attempting placement\n- Verify entity positions before connecting them\n- Maintain fuel levels in burner devices\n- Use existing resources on the map rather than trying to place new ones we don't have\n\nThis analysis should help guide future automation attempts with the currently available resources.", "summary_range": "[1-2144]"}
