It currently shows warnings [\"out of fuel\", \"no input liquid\", \"no fluid present in connections\"] and has replaced the old boiler previously located at (x=-10.5, y=18.0).\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-10.5, y=22.5) which converts steam into electrical power; its warnings remain [\"not connected to power network\", \"no input liquid\", \"no fluid present in connections\"].\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) supplying water to the system.\n- Small Electric Pole (part of ElectricityGroup id=83) with supporting poles at positions (x=-7.5, y=15.5) and (x=-8.5, y=21.5) for power distribution.\n- Pipe Groups associated with the network:\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=259) at position (x=-10.5, y=16.5), status EMPTY.\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=260) at position (x=-12.5, y=18.5), status EMPTY.\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=263) at position (x=-8.5, y=20.5) carrying water, status FULL_OUTPUT.\nNote: Repeated reattempts to connect the new Boiler with the Offshore Pump have not yielded a valid fluid connection.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n- Crafting Dependencies:\n  \u2022 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-plate needed for crafting pipes) can be produced using available furnaces or crafting machines before initiating any craft operations.\n\n- Entity Placement and Spacing:\n  \u2022 Verify that the target tile for an entity placement is unobstructed and within the permitted build range. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions to avoid conflicts with existing entities (such as overlapping pipes).\n  \u2022 When a placement error cites \u201ctarget position is too far away,\u201d ensure the player is moved within the allowed proximity before attempting placement.\n\n- Undefined Entity References:\n  \u2022 Define and initialize all required variables (e.g. new_boiler, new_boiler_position) prior to performing operations like rotation or pipe connection to avoid reference errors.\n\n- Buildable Area Calculation:\n  \u2022 Use correct syntax when computing buildable areas; avoid invoking Position objects as callable entities.\n\n- Fluid Connection Issues:\n  \u2022 Ensure that fluid connection points between devices (such as between the Offshore Pump and the Boiler) are unblocked and properly aligned. Confirm that pipe routing and coordinate matching enable a valid fluid transfer.\n\n- Inventory Verification:\n  \u2022 Check that the necessary entities (for instance, a boiler) are present in the inventory before attempting placement, to prevent errors related to inventory shortages."}
