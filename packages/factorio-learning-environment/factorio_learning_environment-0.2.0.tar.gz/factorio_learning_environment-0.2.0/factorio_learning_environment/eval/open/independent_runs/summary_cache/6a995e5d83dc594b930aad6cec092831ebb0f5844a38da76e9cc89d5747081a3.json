{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone mine at position(-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position: -46.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position: -45.5, 1.5) to collect stone\n- Burner inserter (position: -46.5, 1.5) to feed stone into furnace\n- Stone furnace (position: -44.0, 2.0) to smelt stone into stone bricks\n- Wooden chest (position: -46.5, 2.5) to collect output from inserter\n- Transport belt (position: -45.5, 2.5) to transport stone from chest to furnace\n- Burner inserter (position: -43.5, 0.5) to input stones into furnace\n\n### Iron ore mine at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position: 16.0, 71.0)\n- Wooden chest (position: 15.5, 69.5) to collect iron ore\n- Stone furnace (position: -42.0, 0.0) to smelt iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Iron plate factory\nConsists of \n- Burner inserter (position not explicitly mentioned) to input iron ore into furnace at position (-42.0, 0.0)\n- Burner inserter (position not explicitly mentioned) to extract iron plates from furnace at position (-42.0, 0.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when attempting to insert items into a furnace when the required items are not available in the inventory\n  - Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace.\n* Errors when attempting to craft items without the required sub-ingredients\n  - Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. The required iron-plate amount for assembling-machine-1 is 9, and the required copper-plate amount for copper-cable is 5.\n* Errors when furnace is out of fuel or ingredients\n  - Ensure that the furnace has sufficient fuel and ingredients to operate. The furnace at (-42.0, 0.0) has been fueled with coal and has iron ore to smelt.\n* Errors when chest is full\n  - Ensure that the chest is emptied before continuing to mine or produce items. The chest at (-45.5, 1.5) is full and needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n* Errors when attempting to extract items that are not present in a chest or furnace\n  - Ensure that the required items are present in the chest or furnace before attempting to extract them.\n* Errors when entities are out of fuel\n  - Ensure that entities that require fuel have sufficient fuel to operate. The burner mining drill and burner inserter have been fueled with coal.\n* Errors when output is blocked\n  - Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output. The furnace is not receiving ingredients to smelt because the inserter is waiting for source items.\n* Errors when attempting to connect transport belts directly to entities that are not transport belts\n  - Ensure that transport belts are connected to other transport belts or to inserters that input or output items from the belt.\n* Errors when attempting to place entities at positions that are already occupied\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n* Errors when attempting to place entities too close to other entities\n  - Ensure that there is sufficient spacing between entities to accommodate the new entity.\n* Errors when placing entities too far away from the current position\n  - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before using them in the code. Check for typos and undefined names.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `drill`: likely an entity object representing the burner mining drill (type not explicitly mentioned)\n  - `chest`: likely an entity object representing the wooden chest (type not explicitly mentioned)\n  - `inserter`: likely an entity object representing the burner inserter (type not explicitly mentioned)\n  - `belt`: likely an entity object representing the transport belt (type not explicitly mentioned)\n  - `furnace`: likely an entity object representing the stone furnace (type not explicitly mentioned)\n* Utility functions:\n  - `place_entity(entity: Any, direction: Any, position: Any, exact: Any) -> Any`: Places an entity at a specified position.\n    - Failure mode: Could not place entity at target position due to being too far away or the position being occupied by another entity.\n    - Success mode: Entity is placed successfully at the target position.\n  - `get_entity"}
