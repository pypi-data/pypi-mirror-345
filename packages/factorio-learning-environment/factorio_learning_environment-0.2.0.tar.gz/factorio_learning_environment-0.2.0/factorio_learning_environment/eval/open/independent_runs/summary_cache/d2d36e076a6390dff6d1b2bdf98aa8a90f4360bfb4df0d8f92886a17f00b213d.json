{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Resource Redistribution System\n- Consists of a chest at position (x=61.5, y=-58.5) which is used for temporary storage of resources.\n- Another chest is located at position (x=77.5, y=-122.5) where resources are moved to when the first chest is nearly full.\n- This setup helps in managing overflow and ensures that resources are efficiently redistributed.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n- **Efficient Resource Management**\n  - Regularly monitor the capacity of storage chests to prevent overflow. Implement automated systems to redistribute resources when a chest is nearly full.\n  \n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'burner-mining-drill', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
