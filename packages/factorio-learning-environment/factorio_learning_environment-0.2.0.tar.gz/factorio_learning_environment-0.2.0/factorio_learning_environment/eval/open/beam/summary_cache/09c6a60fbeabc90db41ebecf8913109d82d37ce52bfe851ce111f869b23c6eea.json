{"content": "It seems like the execution is not providing further feedback beyond the initial print statement. This suggests that the script may not be reaching or executing subsequent lines, possibly due to an issue with how the environment is set up or how the script is interacting with it.\n\nHere are some steps to troubleshoot and refine the process:\n\n1. **Check Entity Detection**:\n   - Ensure that the `get_entities()` function is correctly identifying entities. If it returns an empty list, the script will not proceed past the assertion checks.\n   - Verify that the positions used in `get_entities()` are accurate and within the correct radius.\n\n2. **Debugging Output**:\n   - Add more print statements to confirm the script's progress through each step. This can help identify where the script might be halting.\n   - For example, print the length of the list returned by `get_entities()` to confirm if entities are being detected.\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - Ensure that exceptions are being caught and logged correctly. If the script is encountering an error before reaching the `try-except` block, it might not be logging it.\n\n4. **Environment Setup**:\n   - Double-check that the environment is correctly set up and that all necessary entities (assembling machines, furnaces, electric poles) are present and accessible.\n\n5. **Simplify the Process**:\n   - Temporarily simplify the script to focus on one task at a time (e.g., just checking power connectivity) to isolate where the issue might be occurring.\n\nHere is a simplified version of the script to help identify where the issue might be:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting diagnostics...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Check for Assembling Machine\n    assembling_machine_position = Position(x=4.5, y=0.5)\n    assembling_machines = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1}, assembling_machine_position, radius=1)\n    print(f\"Found {len(assembling_machines)} assembling machines.\")\n\n    if assembling_machines:\n        assembling_machine = assembling_machines[0]\n        print(f\"Assembling Machine Status: {assembling_machine.status}\")\n\n        # Check power\n        if assembling_machine.status == EntityStatus.NO_POWER:\n            print(\"Assembling Machine has no power.\")\n            electric_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole}, assembling_machine_position, radius=10)\n            print(f\"Found {len(electric_poles)} electric poles nearby.\")\n\n            if not electric_poles:\n                print(\"No electric poles found.
