{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS and warnings indicating lack of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) with a status of WORKING. It is currently refueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which has a coal inventory of 106. The drill has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors related to furnace ingredients**: \n  - Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate. The current status indicates NO_INGREDIENTS, which means the agent needs to provide iron ore for smelting.\n\n- **Errors when using the Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - The warning about the chest being full suggests that the agent should regularly check and empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue mining efficiently.\n\n- **Repeated insertion of items into the furnace**:\n  - Avoid repeatedly inserting items into the furnace without checking its status. If the furnace is already working or has no ingredients, it may lead to unnecessary actions.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - No specific utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus"}
