{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with coal inventory and iron ore inventory.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) with an inventory containing 50 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 3.5)) with an inventory containing 50 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 5.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 5.5)) with an empty inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities too far away\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing an entity is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required technology\n- Research the necessary technologies before attempting to craft items that require them. For example, the steel chest requires steel processing technology.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without enough resources\n- Gather the required raw resources before crafting items. For instance, ensure you have enough wood to craft a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without the required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure that all sub-ingredients for crafting an item are available in your inventory. If a recipe requires a raw resource, it must be gathered first.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities with no capacity\n- Check the inventory status of the entity you are inserting items into to ensure it has capacity to accept more items. \n\n### Errors related to insufficient science packs for research\n- Accumulate enough Automation Science Packs before attempting to research technologies that require them."}
