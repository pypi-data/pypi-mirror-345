{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, with burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) feeding the chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational.\n- Output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation persists.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, though output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), now connected to power network via small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5), but still lacking iron plates input.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), replaced after removal to free space.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) placed and fueled with coal, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine reports shortage of iron plates preventing crafting.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and output inserter setup but requires sufficient iron plate input to operate.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failure to place small electric poles near steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to existing pole at (0.5, 3.5).\n- Attempted placement of small electric pole next to steam engine failed with suggestion to increase spacing, change direction, or reference position.\n- To avoid these errors, always verify tile occupancy before placement and consider adjusting placement parameters to find free tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) now consistently fueled and operational.\n- Previous issues with inserters out of fuel or full inventory have been mitigated by inserting coal and managing inventories.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) connected to power but still unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates.\n- Input and output inventories of assembling machine remain empty, indicating lack of input materials.\n- Ensure sufficient iron plates are supplied to the assembling machine input chest to enable crafting.\n- Maintain power connection and clear output paths for smooth operation.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Power network connectivity improved with additional poles, including one at (25.5, 77.5) powering the assembling machine.\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items.\n- Verify all machines remain"}
