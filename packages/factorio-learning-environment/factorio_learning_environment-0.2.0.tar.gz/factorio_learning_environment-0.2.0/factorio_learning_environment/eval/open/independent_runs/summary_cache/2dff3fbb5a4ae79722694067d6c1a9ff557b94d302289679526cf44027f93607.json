{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting various positions, including (5.5, 18.5), (7.5, 19.5), (7.5, 18.5), (6.5, 18.5), and more, facilitating fluid transport\n- Small Electric Pole at position (3.5, 20.5) for power distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0), each fueled by coal\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storage\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for transferring materials between chests and furnaces\n\n### Research Lab at Position (Lab)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science packs input and connected to power source\n- Small Electric Pole as part of the Electricity Group for power distribution\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 11.5) and (5.5, 18.5), facilitating fluid transport across the map\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 14.5), (1.5, 2.5), (1.5, 6.5), and (1.5, 10.5) for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure the target position is unoccupied before placing a pipe. Remove any existing entity at the target position before attempting to place a new pipe.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. Ensure the distance is within the maximum allowable range.\n\n### Errors with Research Initiation\n- Ensure that all prerequisites for research are met and that the lab is properly connected to the power source with sufficient science packs.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Verify the steam engine is properly connected to the offshore pump and that there are no missing or misplaced pipes in the network.\n\n### Errors with Entity Retrieval\n- Ensure the correct entity type and position are specified when attempting to retrieve an entity. Verify that the entity exists at the specified location."}
