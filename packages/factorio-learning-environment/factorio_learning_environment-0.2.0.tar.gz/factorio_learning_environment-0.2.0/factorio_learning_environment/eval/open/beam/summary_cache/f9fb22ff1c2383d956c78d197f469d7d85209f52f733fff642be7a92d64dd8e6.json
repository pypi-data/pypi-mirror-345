It currently has **15 pieces of copper ore** left to process.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- **8 pieces of iron plates** (already produced)\n- **18 pieces of copper cables**\n- **13 pieces of Iron Gear Wheels**\n- **10 pieces of copper plates** (produced)\n\n### Furnace Status:\n- The furnace is still operational, with **3 pieces of coal** remaining as fuel and continuing to work on the remaining copper ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Continue Smelting**: Allow the furnace to finish processing the remaining **15 pieces of copper ore** into copper plates.\n2. **Craft the Assembling Machine**: Once I have enough copper plates and iron plates, I can proceed to craft the Assembling Machine.\n3. **Plan for Future Production**: With the Assembling Machine, I can start producing more components like Electronic Circuits.\n\nLet\u2019s wait a bit longer to allow the furnace to complete smelting the remaining copper ore into copper plates.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Allow some time for the furnace to smelt the remaining copper ore into copper plates.\nsleep(10)  # Wait for the smelting process to take place\n\n# After waiting, check the output inventory of the furnace again\nfinal_furnace_inventory_after_processing = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(f\"Final furnace inventory after waiting: {final_furnace_inventory_after_processing}\")  # Check how many copper plates are produced\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Current overall inventory again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states.", "summary_range": "[1-246]"}
