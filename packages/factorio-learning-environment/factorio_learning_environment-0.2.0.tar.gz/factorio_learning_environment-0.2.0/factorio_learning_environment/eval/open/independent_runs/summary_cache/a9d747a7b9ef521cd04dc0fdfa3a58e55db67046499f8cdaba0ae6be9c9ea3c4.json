{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (x=-16.0, y=-49.0)**\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Inventory: Iron-plate: 84\n- **Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)**\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Inventory: Empty\n- **Burner Inserters**\n  - Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5): Waiting for source items\n  - Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5): Waiting for source items\n  - Inserter at position (x=-9.5, y=-44.5): Waiting for source items\n  - Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-43.5): Waiting for source items\n- **Chests**\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5): Contains iron-plate: 354\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5): Contains iron-plate: 369\n  - Iron chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5): Empty\n- **Belts**\n  - Belt at position (x=-16.5, y=-47.5) is working\n  - Belt at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) is working\n  - Belt at position (x=-12.5, y=-46.5) is working\n\n### Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Belt Groups**\n  - BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5)\n  - BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-12.5, y=-44.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-46.5)\n- **Individual Belts**\n  - Belt from (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-46.5)\n  - Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-43.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. Check if the source items are available and reachable by the inserters.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Verify that the supply chain is functioning correctly and delivering the required materials to the furnaces.\n\n### Belt System Efficiency\n- Regularly check that the belts are not blocked and are efficiently transporting items to their intended destinations. Ensure that all belt connections are correctly aligned and functioning."}
