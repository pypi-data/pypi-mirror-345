{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore. It is fueled with coal and is currently operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore. It currently contains 5 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which is aligned to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is fueled with coal but is waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure that the player is within the maximum allowed distance (10 units) from the target position when placing entities. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with potential collisions\n- Verify that the target position for placing an entity is clear of other entities and obstacles. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors with inserter setup\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can effectively transfer items between entities. Make sure the inserter is correctly aligned with both the source and destination entities.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent disruptions in mining operations. Ensure that there is sufficient space in the chest for continued resource collection.\n\n### Insufficient fuel for operations\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Keep a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel entities as needed."}
