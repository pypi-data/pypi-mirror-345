Check for any obstructions or incorrect placements that may prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing lab\n- Make sure the target position for placing the lab is clear of any existing objects. Check the surrounding area to confirm that there is enough space to place the lab without obstruction.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target location."}
