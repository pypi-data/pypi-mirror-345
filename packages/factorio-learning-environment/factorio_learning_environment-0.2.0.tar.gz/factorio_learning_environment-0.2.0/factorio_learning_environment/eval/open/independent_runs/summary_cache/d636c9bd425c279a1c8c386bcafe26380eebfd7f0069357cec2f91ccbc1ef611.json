{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', currently not connected.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a status of 'out of fuel', connected to the steam engine via a pipe network.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), actively working and supplying water through a pipe network.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **PipeGroup** (fluid system 19483) starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), currently empty.\n- **PipeGroup** (fluid system 19494) starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), full and transporting water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** (id=36477) with poles at various positions including (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), and others, currently with no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler's steam output point and the steam engine. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that could prevent a successful connection.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of coal or other fuel types to prevent the boiler from running out of fuel.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Address the warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections' by ensuring that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and receiving steam.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: Attempts to connect two entities with a specified prototype (e.g., Pipe). Failed to connect the boiler's steam output point to the steam engine due to a nil value, indicating a possible misalignment or missing entity in the connection path.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **pipes**: List of pipe entities intended to connect the boiler to the steam engine. Ensure that all pipes are correctly placed and connected to facilitate fluid flow."}
