{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to check the current research status resulted in an error indicating that **no research is currently in progress**. This means I have not initiated any technological advancements that could potentially unlock new recipes.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 3 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 2 pieces of coal remaining for fuel\n- **5 pieces of iron ore**\n- **10 pieces of copper ore**\n- **18 pieces of iron plates** produced and available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The absence of ongoing research limits my ability to unlock new crafting recipes, which is crucial for progressing further.\n- I have a good amount of resources but no immediate way to utilize them effectively.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Initiate Research**: I need to explore available research options that can be initiated to unlock recipes. This may involve gathering specific resources or meeting certain criteria.\n2. **Gather More Resources**: Continue gathering iron ore and copper ore to ensure I have enough materials for crafting once research is completed.\n3. **Plan for Future Production**: Consider setting up additional production entities or enhancing existing ones to prepare for when recipes become available.\n\nLet\u2019s check the available technologies to see if there are any that I can initiate for research. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for available technologies that can be researched\navailable_technologies = get_available_technologies()\nprint(f\"Available Technologies for Research: {available_technologies}\")  # Print available technologies for research.", "summary_range": "[1-220]"}
