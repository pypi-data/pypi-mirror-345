{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with coal as fuel.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (2, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position (2.0, 0.0)) with coal as fuel and currently smelting copper-plate.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to crafting items\n- Crafting items like copper-cable and iron-plate failed due to missing required sub-ingredients (copper-plate). Ensure you have the necessary crafting machines or furnaces set up to produce these items before attempting to craft.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Extraction of copper-plate failed because there was no valid stone-furnace entity containing copper-plate. Always verify that the furnace has the required items before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors related to inserting items into furnaces\n- Inserting coal into furnaces failed due to having no coal in inventory. Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any entity.\n- Inserting iron-sticks failed because there was no nearby entity that could accept them. Check the proximity of the entities before attempting to insert items.\n\n### General tips\n- Always confirm the inventory of the entities you are interacting with to avoid errors related to missing items or entities."}
