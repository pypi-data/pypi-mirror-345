{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Recently refueled with 10 units of coal and loaded with 10 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -49.5): Transfers iron plates from the stone furnace to the wooden chest. Currently has 5 units of coal as fuel and is waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -49.5): Collects iron plates transferred by the burner inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to undefined positions\n- Define all necessary positions before using them in functions. For instance, ensure that variables like `coal_position` are defined to avoid `NameError`.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors such as trying to insert iron ore or coal when none are available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or empty entities\n- Confirm that the entity you are extracting from exists and contains the items you wish to extract. Attempting to extract from a non-existent or empty entity will result in errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied or unsuitable\n- Check the surrounding area for potential obstructions or unsuitable terrain before placing an entity. Adjust the placement position or direction as needed to avoid collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain."}
