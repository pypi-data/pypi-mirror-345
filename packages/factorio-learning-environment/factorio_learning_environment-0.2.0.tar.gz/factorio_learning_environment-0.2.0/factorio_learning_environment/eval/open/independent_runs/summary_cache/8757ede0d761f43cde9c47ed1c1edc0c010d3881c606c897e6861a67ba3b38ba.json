{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with inventory containing 800 coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5). It is currently waiting for space in the destination.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5). It is also waiting for space in the destination.\n- Additional Wooden Chests at positions (42.5, -83.5) and (43.5, -83.5) for expanded storage capacity.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt. It has a furnace result inventory containing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) storing stone-brick, wood, coal, and stone.\n\n### Additional Storage and Processing Area\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) and (62.5, -52.5) each containing coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt. It has a furnace result inventory containing iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., chest) has enough items available to meet the extraction request. If not, adjust the quantity to extract accordingly.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is unoccupied. If another entity is present, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n- Ensure that the inventory has sufficient items to place the desired entity. If not, gather or craft the necessary items before attempting placement.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Regularly check inventory capacity to ensure there is enough space for crafting new items. If the inventory is full, transfer or use items to free up space.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `extract_item`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from a source entity. Ensure the source has enough items to avoid extraction errors.\n  - `place_entity_next_to`: Places an entity next to a specified position with a given direction and spacing. Confirm the target position is unoccupied and the inventory has the required items.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `coal_extracted`: Represents the quantity of coal extracted from a chest.\n  - `new_chest`: Represents a newly placed wooden chest for expanded storage capacity."}
