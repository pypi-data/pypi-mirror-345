{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the above components\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for copper ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for producing copper cables\n- Inserter at Position (x=13.5, y=0.5) feeding the assembling machine\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Storage and Transport System\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storing resources\n- Belt Group for transporting items between structures\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe network is continuous and properly aligned to connect the offshore pump to the steam engine. Verify that all connection points are correctly positioned.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Maintain sufficient coal in your inventory to fuel boilers and furnaces. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors in Resource Availability\n- Ensure that all required resources are available for the assembling machine to produce items. Check the inventory and supply lines to prevent missing ingredients.\n\n### Errors in Electrical Connections\n- Verify that all electrical components are properly connected to the power grid. Ensure that poles and wires are correctly placed to provide power to all machines and inserters.\n\n### Inserter Placement and Power Issues\n- Position inserters correctly to ensure they can pick up and drop items as intended. Make sure they are connected to a power source to avoid operational interruptions."}
