Check for existing pipes or entities at the target positions before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. If the tile is occupied by another entity, remove the existing entity before placing a new one.\n\n### Errors related to boiler and offshore pump connections\n- Verify that the boiler is connected to a valid water source and that the offshore pump is functioning correctly. Check the fluid connections and ensure there are no blockages.\n\n### Errors when using existing pipes\n- If you encounter issues with existing pipes, consider removing and replacing them to ensure a clear connection path."}
