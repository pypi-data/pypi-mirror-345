{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) and (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with coal as fuel and producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with coal as fuel, currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System at Position (x=6.5, y=-60.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at Position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to:\n  - Small Electric Pole at Position (x=5.5, y=-60.5)\n  - Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (x=7.5, y=-61.5)\n  - Small Electric Pole at Position (x=7.5, y=-60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=7.5, y=-61.5) for storage.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=6.5, y=-59.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Laboratory at Position (x=6.5, y=-59.5)\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.5) not connected to the power network.\n- Boiler at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) with coal as fuel, not connected to fluid sources.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) not connected to fluid sources.\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions: (x=-8.5, y=22.5), (x=-9.5, y=22.5), (x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=23.5), (x=-6.5, y=22.5), (x=-7.5, y=22.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles forming electricity groups, currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free from other entities before placing a new entity. Attempting to place pipes or electric poles on occupied tiles will result in failure.\n\n### Errors when placing entities over water\n- Avoid placing entities like pipes over water as they cannot be placed due to footprint overlap.\n\n### Connection Errors for Power Network\n- Ensure there are no blockages between entities that need to be connected. Check for clear paths when connecting steam engines to small electric poles to avoid placement blockages.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Ensure all entities requiring power are connected to a functional power network. Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power grid and that all electric poles are correctly placed and connected."}
