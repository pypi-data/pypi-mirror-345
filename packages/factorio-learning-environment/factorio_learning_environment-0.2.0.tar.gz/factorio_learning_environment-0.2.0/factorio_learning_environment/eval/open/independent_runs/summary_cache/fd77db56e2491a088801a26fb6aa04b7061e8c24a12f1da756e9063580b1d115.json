{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5), boiler (position -24.5, -50.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not generating power due to connection issues and lack of input fluids. The boiler is connected to the steam engine via pipes but is failing to connect properly.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Lab at position(-10.5, -10.5)\nThe lab is currently found at position (-10.5, -10.5) but has no power.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly placed and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Check the coordinates for any overlaps or misalignments.\n\n### Errors related to power generation\n- The steam engine is not generating power due to connection issues and lack of input fluids. Verify that the boiler is properly connected and has a sufficient supply of water.\n\n### Errors when using attributes in code\n- Review the code for any incorrect attribute references. For example, 'Prototype.Water' does not exist; ensure to use the correct attribute names.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when the lab has no power\n- Connect the lab to a power source to ensure it operates correctly. Check the electrical connections in the vicinity."}
