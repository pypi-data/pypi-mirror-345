{"content": "The error indicates that I am still too far from the target position to place the stone furnace. The distance from my current position (0, 0) to the desired position (-15, 26) exceeds the maximum allowable distance of 10 units.\n\n### Summary of Attempts\n1. **Initial Movement**: Attempted to move to a position near the iron ore patch but did not get close enough to place the furnace.\n2. **Subsequent Movements**: Tried to move to a position that was still too far from the target placement location.\n3. **Placement Attempt**: Failed to place the stone furnace due to exceeding the maximum distance.\n\n### Tips for Avoiding Errors in the Future\n1. **Check Distances**: Always calculate the distance between the current position and the target position before attempting to place an entity. Ensure that it is within the allowable range.\n2. **Incremental Movement**: Move incrementally closer to the target position rather than making large jumps. This helps ensure that you remain within the placement range.\n3. **Use `nearest_buildable`**: Utilize the `nearest_buildable` function to find a valid position for placing the entity. This function will automatically consider the distance constraints.\n4. **Visualize Positions**: If possible, visualize the positions and distances to better understand where you can place entities relative to your current location.\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to catch placement errors and adjust the position accordingly before retrying.\n\n### Next Steps\nI will now move to a position that is definitely within the allowed range of 10 units from my current position to successfully place the stone furnace. Let's try moving to a position that is directly adjacent to where I want to place the stone furnace. \n\nI will move to (-5.0, 5.0) as a closer position. \n\nmove_to(Position(-5.0, 5.0))  # Move to a position that is within the range to place the stone furnace.", "summary_range": "[1-36]"}
