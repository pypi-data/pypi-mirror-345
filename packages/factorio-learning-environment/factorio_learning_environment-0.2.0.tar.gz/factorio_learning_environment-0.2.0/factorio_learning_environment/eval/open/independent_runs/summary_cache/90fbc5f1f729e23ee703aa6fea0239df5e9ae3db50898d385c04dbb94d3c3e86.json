{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0), refueled and actively smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0), refueled and actively smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0), refueled and actively smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Multiple chests for storage of iron ore and iron plates at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), (-13.5, -49.5), (-9.5, -49.5), and (-14.5, -47.5)\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution System at Position (47.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple iron chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for coal and iron plate storage\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring coal between chests\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for potential smelting operations\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for coal extraction\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter and Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all inserters have adequate fuel to operate. Regularly check and refuel burner inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Avoid overfilling chests, especially at drop positions of mining drills. Regularly clear out or transfer items from chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces are consistently refueled and supplied with raw materials to maintain continuous production. Regularly check furnace inventories for both fuel and input materials."}
