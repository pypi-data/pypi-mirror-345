{"content": "Ah, I see the issue. We need to check if the item name matches exactly how it appears in the inventory. Let's debug this:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Craft a stone furnace - note the item name is 'stone-furnace' in inventory\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\n\n# Verify the craft was successful\nnew_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory after crafting: {new_inventory}\")\n\n# Check if we have the furnace using the correct inventory key\nif 'stone-furnace' in new_inventory:\n    # Now place the furnace\n    move_to(Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0))\n    furnace = place_entity(\n        Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n        position=Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0),\n        direction=Direction.UP,\n        exact=True\n    )\n\n    # Add fuel to furnace\n    if furnace:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n        print(f\"Successfully placed and fueled furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n        # Now place inserter\n        move_to(Position(x=-10.5, y=28.5))\n        inserter = place_entity(\n            Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n            position=Position(x=-10.5, y=28.5),\n            direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n            exact=True\n        )\n        \n        if inserter:\n            # Add fuel to inserter\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n            print(f\"Successfully placed and fueled inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Verify final setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Final entity setup: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis should work better as we're:\n1. Using the correct inventory key ('stone-furnace')\n2. Verifying the craft was successful before attempting to place\n3. Moving to the correct position before placement\n4. Adding fuel after successful placement", "summary_range": "[1-560]"}
