{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing extracted copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) moving items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Processing\n- Wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) is empty.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Remove any existing entities at the target position before placing a new one.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory or destination\n- Regularly check and empty full chests to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of space in the destination.\n- Ensure furnaces have ingredients to smelt to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills and inserters to ensure they remain operational. Refill them as needed to avoid production stoppages."}
