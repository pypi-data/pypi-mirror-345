{"content": "The repeated failure to place the stone furnace suggests that I am still too far from the target position, despite my efforts to move closer. The error indicates that the distance from my current position (0, 0) to the desired placement position (-15.0, 26.0) exceeds the maximum allowable distance for placing entities.\n\n### Summary of Issues:\n1. **Distance Limitations**: The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units, and I have been attempting to place the furnace at positions that are significantly farther away.\n2. **Movement Strategy**: I need to adjust my movement strategy to ensure I am within the correct range before attempting to place any entities.\n\n### Tips for Future Actions:\n1. **Move Closer**: Always ensure that the movement command brings me within the 10-unit range of the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n2. **Incremental Movement**: Move incrementally toward the target position, checking the distance to ensure I am within the allowable range.\n3. **Use of `nearest_buildable`**: Consider using the `nearest_buildable` function to find a valid position for placing the stone furnace that is guaranteed to be within range.\n4. **Verify Positioning**: After moving, verify my current position relative to the target before attempting placement.\n\n### Next Steps:\nI will move to a position that is guaranteed to be within the 10-unit range of the stone furnace placement. I will choose coordinates that are closer to the origin, such as (x=-5, y=5), to ensure I am within the required distance.\n\nmove_to(Position(x=-5.0, y=5.0))  # Moving to a position that is much closer to the origin.", "summary_range": "[1-74]"}
