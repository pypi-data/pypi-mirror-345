{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) connected to a transport belt at position (41.5, -84.5)\n- Transport belts at positions (41.5, -84.5), (41.5, -83.5), (41.5, -82.5) directing items upwards\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5) transferring items from the transport belt to a wooden chest at position (40.5, -81.5)\n\n### Coal Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs at (50.5, -86.5) and outputs at (49.5, -86.5), inventory contains coal\n- BeltGroup with inputs at (54.5, -86.5) and outputs at (52.5, -82.5), currently empty\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0), currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients, but with a stock of iron plates\n\n### Miscellaneous Belt Systems\n- Multiple BeltGroups and individual belts connecting various positions, facilitating item transport across the map\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that the path for connecting transport belts is valid and clear of obstructions. Check that the belts are aligned correctly and that there is a continuous path between the intended start and end points.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source entity is producing or has produced items for the inserter to pick up. Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned with both the source and destination entities.\n\n### Errors when output is blocked by items on the ground\n- Regularly clear items blocking outputs to ensure continuous operation of drills and other production entities. Implement a system to automatically handle excess items if possible."}
