{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) which is currently working. It has a fuel inventory of 9 coal, a source inventory of 11 iron ore, and a result inventory of 70 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) fueled with coal, currently waiting for space in the destination. It is connected to a transport belt system.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) fueled with coal, currently waiting for source items. It is connected to the burner mining drill and transport belt system.\n- Transport Belt system starting at position (43.5, -82.5) and aligned correctly. It includes belts running from (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) in the right direction and from (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5) in the down direction.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chest\n- Ensure there is no obstruction or existing entity at the target position before attempting to place a Wooden Chest. Multiple attempts to place Wooden Chests at various positions such as (50.0, -79.5), (52.0, -79.5), and (43.5, -79.5) failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Verify that the target position for placing a Burner Inserter is free from obstructions and suitable for placement. Attempts to place Burner Inserters at positions like (49.5, -79.5), (51.5, -79.5), and (42.5, -79.5) were unsuccessful due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept outputs from the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage. The drill at position (42.0, -83.0) has its output blocked, indicating no sink entity is present to accept the output.\n\n### Chest is Full\n- Regularly check and clear the inventory of chests to avoid situations where inserters are unable to transfer items due to full chests. The burner inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) is currently unable to operate because the connected chest is full."}
