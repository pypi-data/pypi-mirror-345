{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) with iron plate output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0) with iron plate output.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) feeding copper ore to the line.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the furnaces.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) transferring items from belts to furnaces.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with iron plate output.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transferring items to storage.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) with iron plate output.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-61.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various parts of the production lines, facilitating the movement of resources and products across the facilities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Empty Belts\n- Ensure that resources are being fed onto the belts. Check the input sources to ensure they are operational and not blocked.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly check the supply lines to ensure that furnaces receive the necessary ingredients for smelting. Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned and operational.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that resources are flowing smoothly.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to maintain continuous operation. Consider automating fuel supply to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Full Furnace Fuel Source\n- Monitor the fuel levels in furnaces and ensure they are not overfilled. Adjust the fuel supply to match the consumption rate."}
