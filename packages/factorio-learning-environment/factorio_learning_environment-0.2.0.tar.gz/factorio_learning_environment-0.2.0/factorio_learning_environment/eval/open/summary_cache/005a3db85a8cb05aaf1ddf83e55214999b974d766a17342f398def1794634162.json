{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with frequent full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) receiving iron plates, with burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) feeding the chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace output persists, limiting throughput.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with stable power and inserter fueling, but output congestion remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Coal inserted regularly into boiler, maintaining operation.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and operational.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) currently empty.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine input and output inventories intermittently contain iron plates and iron gear wheels, but output chest remains empty.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and inserter setup with iron plate input, but no gear wheels are reaching the output chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Output chest empty despite assembling machine producing items\n- Attempts to extract iron gear wheels from output chest at (25.5, 82.5) repeatedly fail due to chest being empty.\n- Assembling machine inventories show presence of iron gear wheels, but output chest remains empty.\n- Possible causes include output inserter at (25.5, 83.5) not picking up assembled gear wheels or incorrect inserter configuration.\n- Verify output inserter placement and ensure it is correctly positioned to pick items from assembling machine output and place into output chest.\n- Confirm inserter is powered and operational, and output chest is accessible.\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace output belt\n- Electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked due to furnace output belt congestion.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept iron plates from furnace.\n- Consider adding more storage or faster belts to prevent backup.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous issues placing small electric poles near steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to tile occupancy remain relevant.\n- Always verify tile occupancy before placement and adjust position or direction to find free tiles.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) now receives iron plates and is crafting iron gear wheels.\n- Maintain sufficient iron plate supply and clear output paths for smooth operation.\n\nOverall, focus on resolving output inserter and chest transfer issues in the iron gear wheel assembly structure and clearing furnace output belt blockage to improve throughput.\n\n"}
