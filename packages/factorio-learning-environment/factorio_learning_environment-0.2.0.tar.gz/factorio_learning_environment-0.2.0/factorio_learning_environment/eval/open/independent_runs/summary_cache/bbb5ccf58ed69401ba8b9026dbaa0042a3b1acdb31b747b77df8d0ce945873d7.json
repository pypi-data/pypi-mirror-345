{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator near position (x=0.0, y=12.0)\n\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. Water is pumped from the lake by an offshore pump, heated into steam by two boilers, and then piped to four steam engines arranged in two columns. The steam engines are interconnected with pipes and connected to a central small electric pole, forming a functional power network. The boilers require manual coal insertion (refueled in steps 40, 43, 45, 46, 47).\n\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water. Connected via pipes to the boilers.\n*   **Boiler 1** at position (x=0.0, y=10.5): Heats water using coal. Steam output piped to Steam Engine 1.\n*   **Boiler 2** at position (x=0.0, y=13.5): Heats water using coal. Steam output piped to Steam Engine 2.\n*   **Steam Engine 1** at position (x=6.5, y=10.5): Consumes steam to generate power.\n*   **Steam Engine 2** at position (x=6.5, y=13.5): Consumes steam to generate power.\n*   **Steam Engine 3** at position (x=12.5, y=10.5): Consumes steam to generate power.\n*   **Steam Engine 4** at position (x=12.5, y=13.5): Consumes steam to generate power.\n*   **Pipe Network**: Connects the offshore pump, boilers, and steam engines.\n*   **Electric Pole Network**: Connects steam engines and distributes power.\n\n### Iron Plate Production near position (x=19.5, y=73.0)\n\nThis structure mines Iron Ore, smelts it into Iron Plates, and transports the plates onto a belt line ending in a collection chest.\n\n*   **Electric Mining Drill 1** at position (x=17.5, y=71.5): Mines Iron Ore. Drops ore onto the ground for Furnace 1. Connected to the electric network.\n*   **Electric Mining Drill 2** at position (x=20.5, y=71.5): Mines Iron Ore. Drops ore onto the ground for Furnace 2. Connected to the electric network.\n*   **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=18.0, y=74.0): Smel"}
