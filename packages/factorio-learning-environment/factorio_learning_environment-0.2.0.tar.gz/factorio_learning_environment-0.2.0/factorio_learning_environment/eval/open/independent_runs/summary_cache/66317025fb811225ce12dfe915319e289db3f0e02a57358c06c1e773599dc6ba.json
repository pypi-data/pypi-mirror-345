{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nThis structure is responsible for generating electricity using steam power. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5), currently working.\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0), currently working and fueled with coal.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5), currently working to supply water.\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, ensuring the flow of water and steam.\n\n#### Pipe Groups\n- **PipeGroup (Water)** at position (-8.5, 23.5), currently working, connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n- **PipeGroup (Steam)** at position (-5.5, 16.5), currently working, connecting the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n#### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group** with small electric poles at positions (-7.5, 19.5), (-7.5, 20.5), (-7.5, 21.5), (-7.5, 22.5), and (-6.5, 22.5), currently not plugged into the electric network.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are within a valid range and properly aligned. Check that there are no obstructions and that the correct type of pipe is used.\n\n#### Errors When Inserting Items\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like boilers. Keep track of your inventory to avoid such errors.\n\n#### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like electric poles. Craft or gather the required items if they are not available.\n\n#### Index Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- When accessing entities from a list or group, ensure that the index is within the valid range. Check that the list is not empty before attempting to access its elements."}
