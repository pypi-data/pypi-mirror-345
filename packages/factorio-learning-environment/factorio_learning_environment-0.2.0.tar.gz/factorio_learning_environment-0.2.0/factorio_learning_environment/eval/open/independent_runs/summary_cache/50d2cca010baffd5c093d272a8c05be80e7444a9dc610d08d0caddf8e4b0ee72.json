There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40000 units)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing entities or items on the ground that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the destination location is valid and unoccupied before moving an entity. Ensure that the entity can be placed at the new position without conflicts.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified location before attempting to retrieve it. Use appropriate methods to check for entity existence to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output of mining drills\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a furnace or chest, to accept the output from the mining drill. Clear any items blocking the output position to maintain continuous operation."}
