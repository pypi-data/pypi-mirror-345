{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -21.5, 28.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is currently not connected due to missing input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Lab at position(0, 0)\nConsists of a lab (position 0, 0) which is currently missing science packs for research.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups located at:\n- PipeGroup (position -12.5, 14.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -16.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -9.5, 19.5) - currently full of water\n- PipeGroup (position -13.5, 21.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are placed correctly and are within the connection range of the entities they are meant to connect. Check the positions of both the pipes and the entities to ensure they align.\n\n### Errors when using attributes of objects\n- Avoid using attributes that do not exist for certain object types. For example, the 'PipeGroup' object does not have a 'prototype_name' attribute. Always verify the available attributes for the object type you are working with.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position to avoid placement errors."}
