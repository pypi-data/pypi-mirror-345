{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been created on the map as of the latest execution steps. The entities on the map remain empty, indicating that no buildings or functional setups have been established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Wooden Chest Placement Errors**: Multiple attempts to place a Wooden Chest at various coordinates (e.g., x=100.0 y=-150.0, x=0.0 y=10.0, x=10.0 y=0.0) failed. Ensure the target tile is not occupied and is suitable for placement.\n- **Transport Belt Placement Error**: Attempt to place a Transport Belt at x=65.0 y=-105.0 was unsuccessful. Verify that the tile is clear and that the belt can be placed in the intended direction.\n- **Stone Furnace Placement Error**: Attempt to place a Stone Furnace at x=5.0 y=5.0 failed. Check that the area is not obstructed and is appropriate for furnace placement.\n- **Burner Inserter Placement Error**: Attempt to place a Burner Inserter at x=-50.0 y=50.0 was not successful. Confirm that the tile is free of obstructions and that the inserter can function as intended.\n\nTo avoid these errors, always verify the placement area is clear and suitable for the entity you intend to place. Consider using the map's visual indicators to confirm the availability of space before attempting to place any structures."}
