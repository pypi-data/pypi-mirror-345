{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\nThis facility is responsible for processing coal and iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Coal Processing Unit at Position (x=41.5, y=-80.5):**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0)\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-80.5)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\n- **Iron Ore Processing Unit at Position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5):**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-9.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters into Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity into a tile before attempting placement. If a wooden chest or another entity already exists at the intended position, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or altering the reference position.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place an entity. If an item is missing, craft or acquire the necessary item before proceeding with the placement.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to function. If inserters are waiting for source items, check the connected chests or belts to ensure they are not empty or blocked."}
