The last furnace at (1.0, 2.0) is out of fuel and cannot smelt anything.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. We need to wait for the new stone furnace to finish smelting the remaining iron ore into iron plates.\n2. After the smelting process is complete, we will check the inventory for the total number of iron plates.\n\nLet\u2019s wait for a short duration to allow the new stone furnace to smelt the remaining iron ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a short period to allow the new stone furnace to process the iron ore\nfor _ in range(10):  # Checking over 10 seconds\n    sleep(1)  # Waits 1 second between checks\n    new_furnace_status = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\n    \n    if new_furnace_status.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 1) >= 1:  # Check if any iron plates were produced\n        print(\"Iron plate(s) are ready for extraction from the new furnace.\")\n        break\nelse:\n    print(\"Smelting timeout - check fuel and inputs for the new furnace.\")  # If we didn't find iron plates after 10 seconds\n\n# Check for produced iron plates in the new stone furnace\nprint(f\"New Stone Furnace Inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory(new_furnace)}\") ", "summary_range": "[1-82]"}
