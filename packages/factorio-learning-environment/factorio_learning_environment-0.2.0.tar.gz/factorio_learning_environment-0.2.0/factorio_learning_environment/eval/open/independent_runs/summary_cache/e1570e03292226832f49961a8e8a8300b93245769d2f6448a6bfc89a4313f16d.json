{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities with fluid system ID 2406\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) for transferring materials\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) and Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) for storage\n- BeltGroup connecting these entities for efficient material transfer\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup with inputs at position (-11.5, -46.5) and outputs at position (-8.5, -43.5)\n- BeltGroup with inputs at position (-12.5, -44.5) and outputs at position (-11.5, -46.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, providing power to connected entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities have items available for the inserters to pick up. Check the status of the inserters and ensure they are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities.\n\n### No Research in Progress\n- Assign research tasks to labs to ensure continuous technological advancement. Make sure the lab is supplied with necessary science packs."}
