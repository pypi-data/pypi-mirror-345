{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been created on the map yet. The agent's attempts to place entities have been unsuccessful, as indicated by the logs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is buildable before attempting to place an entity. The logs indicate multiple failed attempts to place Wooden Chests and Transport Belts at various coordinates, such as (x=5.0, y=5.0), (x=10.0, y=10.0), and (x=0.0, y=0.0). Verify the buildability of the target location before placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check that the target tile is not occupied by another entity or object before placing a new entity. The logs show repeated failures to place Wooden Chests and Transport Belts at specific coordinates, suggesting that these tiles may be occupied or otherwise unsuitable for placement.\n\n### General Placement Strategy\n- Review the map layout and plan placements strategically to avoid repeated errors. Consider using a grid or marking system to track which tiles have been checked for buildability and occupancy.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in placing structures and utilizing resources effectively."}
