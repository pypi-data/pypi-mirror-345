Relocate the pipes to a suitable land area to avoid overlap with water.\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes Where Existing Objects Block Placement\n- Before placing pipes, check for existing objects that might obstruct placement. Clear the area or choose a different path for the pipes.\n\n### Offshore Pump and Boiler Connection Issues\n- Ensure that offshore pumps are correctly connected to the boilers. Check for warnings like \"No fluid present in connections\" and ensure proper alignment and connectivity between entities.\n\n### Handling Excess Offshore Pumps\n- Avoid placing multiple offshore pumps in the same location unless necessary. Remove excess pumps to prevent redundancy and resource wastage."}
