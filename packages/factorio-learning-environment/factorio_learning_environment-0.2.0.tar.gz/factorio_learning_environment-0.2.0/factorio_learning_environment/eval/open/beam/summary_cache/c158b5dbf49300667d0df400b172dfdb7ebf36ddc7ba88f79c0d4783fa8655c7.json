Here\u2019s the updated status:\n\n### Current Furnace Status:\n1. **First Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 9 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 10 (now available for processing)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 56 (total)\n   - Status: WORKING (currently processing)\n\n2. **Second Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 11 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 3 (available for processing)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 31 (total)\n   - Status: WORKING (currently processing)\n\n### Summary:\n- The first furnace is now processing the newly inserted 10 iron ore, which will increase its total production of iron plates.\n- The second furnace continues to operate with 3 iron ore available.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Monitor both furnaces as they process their respective iron ore.\n2. Once the first furnace completes its processing, we can check the total number of iron plates produced and gather more iron ore if needed.\n\nLet's wait briefly to see how many iron plates are produced by both furnaces after a short pause.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the furnaces to process their iron ore\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration if needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-104]"}
