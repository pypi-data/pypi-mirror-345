{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates and coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) to the Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) with a warning for output blockage due to lack of a sink entity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) for storing mined copper ore.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal collection.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transferring items between the Stone Furnace and Wooden Chest.\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities for item transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities at specific positions\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity type matches.\n\n### AttributeError due to NoneType object\n- Verify that all variables are properly initialized and assigned before using them in operations. Ensure that entities are correctly placed and connected before attempting to access their attributes.\n\n### Output blockage warnings\n- Ensure that there is a valid sink entity (e.g., a chest or conveyor belt) to receive the output from mining drills to prevent blockage and ensure continuous operation."}
