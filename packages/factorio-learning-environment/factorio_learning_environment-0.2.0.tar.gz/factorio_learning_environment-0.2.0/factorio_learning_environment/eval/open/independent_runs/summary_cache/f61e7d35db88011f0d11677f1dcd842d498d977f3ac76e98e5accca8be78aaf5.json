{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroups connecting these entities:\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with fluid system 6848\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=23.5) with fluid system 6855\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-1.5, y=22.5) with fluid system 6852\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-3.5, y=24.5) with fluid system 6850\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=13.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5) for transferring materials between furnaces\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at position (electrical_id=3889) for conducting research, currently missing science packs\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), and (x=1.5, y=6.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure the target position for placing a pipe is not already occupied by another entity. Remove any existing entity at the target position before attempting to place a new pipe.\n\n### Incorrect Use of Entity References\n- When checking the type of an entity, ensure the correct reference is used. Use `entities.Lab` instead of `Lab` to avoid `NameError`.\n- Avoid using incorrect data types such as lists when checking for entity types to prevent `AttributeError`.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status of entities like furnaces and labs to ensure they have the necessary inputs and are functioning correctly.\n- Maintain a clear inventory to avoid confusion and ensure efficient resource management."}
