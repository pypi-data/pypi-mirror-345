{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Automation at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace positioned at (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting operations; updated state shows fuel reserve {'coal': 14}, energy level 1600.0, an internal ingredient inventory containing {'iron-ore': 5}, and a result inventory with {'iron-plate': 9} indicating ongoing smelting progress.\n- Wooden Chest positioned at (-13.5, -49.5) serving as storage.\n- Burner Inserter positioned at (-12.5, -49.5) responsible for transferring items between the furnace and the chest; rotated to face DOWN with a pickup position of (-12.5, -50.5) and a drop position of (-12.5, -48.5), maintaining a fuel reserve of {'coal': 4}.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Placement Conflicts Due to Insufficient Spacing\n- Verify target positions for placement are unoccupied; adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if adjacent entities cause conflicts.\n\n### Stale Entity Data Management\n- Confirm entity data synchronization after operations; use validation commands or refresh requests to retrieve current entity states.\n\n### Inconsistent Extraction and Insertion Practices\n- Ensure proximity to the target entity and availability of desired items before executing extraction or insertion operations; verify that correct entities are passed as arguments and that quantities in inventories meet process requirements.\n\n### Timing and Production Output Verification\n- Allow sufficient time for processes to update; incorporate delays or status checks between actions to confirm updated production outputs.\n- When output inventories do not reflect expected quantities (e.g., insufficient iron plates), review and adjust waiting periods or process triggers to ensure complete smelting before extraction."}
