{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) delivering iron ore to a stone furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) configured to deliver iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Additional Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items, possibly for further coal processing or transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity available to accept the output from inserters to prevent blockage. For example, the burner inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) is blocked due to no sink entity in place.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. The chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function correctly. The inserters at positions (-11.5, -48.5), (-8.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -46.5) are waiting for source items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
