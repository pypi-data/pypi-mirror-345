{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) to another Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System at position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) dropping iron ore into a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting to transfer items from the Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or belts) have items available for the inserters to pick up. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain to avoid inserters waiting unnecessarily.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty chests that are part of the mining and processing systems to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Specifically, the chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) needs to be monitored and emptied to continue iron ore mining.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n- `wood`: int = 10\n- `coal`: int = 690\n- `iron-ore`: int = 937\n- `iron-plate`: int = 1065\n\nThe report is based on the logs from steps 656 to 663, summarizing the current state of the structures and providing tips for error mitigation."}
