{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nUse-case: Processes iron ore into iron plates. Recently, the furnace was resupplied with 10 units of iron ore; however, it continues to exhibit a warning state (NO_INGREDIENTS) and now faces smelting delays.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities with insufficient inventory\n- Verify that the required item exists in the inventory before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when operating furnaces without consistent ingredient supply\n- Ensure a continuous supply of ore to the furnace to avoid warning states such as NO_INGREDIENTS, which can disrupt the smelting process.\n\n### Errors when experiencing smelting timeouts\n- Allocate sufficient processing time for furnaces to complete smelting, and verify that the furnace\u2019s operational parameters allow for the expected rate; consider checking the fuel levels or any blockages that might cause delays.\n\nPrevious errors have been carried forward."}
