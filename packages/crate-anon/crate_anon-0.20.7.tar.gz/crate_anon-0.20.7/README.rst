Purpose
-------

Create and use de-identified databases for research.

- Anonymises relational databases.

- Extracts and de-identifies text from associated binary files.

- Performs some specific preprocessing tasks; e.g.

  - preprocesses some specific databases (e.g. Servelec RiO EMR);
  - drafts a "data dictionary" for anonymisation, with special knowledge of
    some databases (e.g. TPP SystmOne);
  - fetches some word lists, e.g. forenames/surnames/eponyms.

- Provides tools to link databases, including via Bayesian personal identity
  matching, in identifiable or de-identified fashion.

- Provides a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, including built-in
  NLP, support for external tools, and client/server support for the Natural
  Language Processing Request Protocol (NLPRP).

- Web app for

  - querying the anonymised database;
  - providing a de-identification API;
  - managing a consent-to-contact process.
