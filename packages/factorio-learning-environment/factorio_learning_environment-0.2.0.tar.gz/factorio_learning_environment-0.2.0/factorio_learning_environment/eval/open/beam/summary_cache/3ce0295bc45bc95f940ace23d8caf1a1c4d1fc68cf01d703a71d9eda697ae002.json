{"content": "I notice from the entity status that we have two key issues:\n\n1. The mining drill at (-15.0, 23.0) has no fuel\n2. The mining drill at (-11.0, 25.0) has a blocked output belt\n\nLet's fix the first issue by adding fuel to the mining drill:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory first\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Add fuel to the mining drill that's out of fuel\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0), quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to mining drill\")\n\n# Verify the mining drill's status\ndrill = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\nif drill:\n    print(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\n\n# Check final inventory\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should get the first mining drill working again. After this succeeds, we can address the blocked belt issue at the second mining drill.\n\nLet me know if you need any adjustments to this solution.", "summary_range": "[1-672]"}
