Direct connections between belts and furnaces are not supported.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Ensure that all inserters and assembling machines are connected to a power network with sufficient electricity to function. Check the connections and ensure that the power poles are correctly placed to supply power to all necessary entities."}
