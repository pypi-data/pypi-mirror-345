{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-2, -76)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-2.0, y=-76.0) mining iron ore\n- Mining drill's drop position is at (x=-1.5, y=-74.5)\n- Currently waiting for space in destination\n\n###Copper Production Line at (-21, -73)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-21.0, y=-73.0) mining copper ore\n- Iron chest (x=-21.5, y=-74.5)\n- Burner inserter (x=-20.5, y=-74.5) moving items from chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace (x=-19.0, y=-74.0) smelting copper plates\n\n###Unused Furnace Group at (3, -73)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (x=3.0, y=-73.0)\n- Stone furnace (x=5.0, y=-73.0)\nBoth furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n\n###Isolated Inserter at (-1.5, -72.5)\n- Single burner inserter with no fuel and no connected entities\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing entities that interact with each other (like drills and furnaces), ensure the drop position of one entity aligns with the input position of the other\n- Verify entity positions before placement to ensure they can properly interact with existing structures\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner inserters to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel\n- Remove blocking items or entities before attempting to place new structures\n- Ensure there's a proper output destination for mining drills to prevent them from getting blocked\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- When creating production lines, ensure all entities are properly connected (miners to furnaces, inserters between entities)\n- Avoid placing isolated entities that cannot interact with other structures\n\n### Entity Retrieval Errors\n- When using get_entity(), ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to access it\n- Validate entity positions before performing operations on them"}
