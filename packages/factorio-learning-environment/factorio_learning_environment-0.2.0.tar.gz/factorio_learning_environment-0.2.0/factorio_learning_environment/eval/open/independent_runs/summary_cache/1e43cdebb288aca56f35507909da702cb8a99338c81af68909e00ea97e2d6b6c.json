It currently has coal as fuel and 100 iron plates as the result.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting items into a furnace**: Ensure that the second argument passed to the `insert_item` function is an Entity or EntityGroup. The error occurred because a Position was passed instead. Verify that the correct entity reference is used when attempting to insert items.\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**: Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `insert_item(entity: Entity, position: Position, quantity: int)`: This function failed due to an incorrect argument type being passed.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `extracted_ore: int` - Assigned the value of 9 after extraction.\n  - `inserted_ore: Entity` - Expected to be an Entity but received a Position, causing an error."}
