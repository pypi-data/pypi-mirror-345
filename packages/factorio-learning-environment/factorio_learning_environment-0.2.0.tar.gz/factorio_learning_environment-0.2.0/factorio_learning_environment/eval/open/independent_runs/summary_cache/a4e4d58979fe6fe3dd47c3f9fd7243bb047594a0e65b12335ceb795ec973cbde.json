Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (8 units), Iron Plate (3 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (15 units)\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (6 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Connected to:\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as mining drills and inserters, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation. Monitor coal inventory closely and harvest more coal when necessary.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and clear out the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent mining interruptions. Ensure there is enough space in the chest for mined resources.\n\n### Errors with Iron Plate Production\n- Verify that the furnace is consistently supplied with iron ore and coal to avoid production halts. Ensure inserters are correctly aligned and operational to transfer materials efficiently."}
