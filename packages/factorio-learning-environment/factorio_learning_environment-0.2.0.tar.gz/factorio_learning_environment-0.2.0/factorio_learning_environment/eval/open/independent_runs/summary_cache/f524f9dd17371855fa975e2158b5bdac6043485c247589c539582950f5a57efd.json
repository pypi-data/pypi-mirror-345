{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or changing the reference position if there is a collision with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position and the drop position aligns with the furnace's position to facilitate proper transfer of items.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly aligned and operational to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace."}
