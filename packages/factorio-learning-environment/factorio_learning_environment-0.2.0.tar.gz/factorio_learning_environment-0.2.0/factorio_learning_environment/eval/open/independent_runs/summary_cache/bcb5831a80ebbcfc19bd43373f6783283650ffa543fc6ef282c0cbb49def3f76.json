{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a Pumpjack (position: x=17.5, y=40.5)\n\n### Water Supply at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an Offshore Pump (position: x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when using undefined variables\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before using them. For example, the error in steps 1 and 2 was caused by using an undefined variable 'entity'.\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied or unplaceable positions\n  - Ensure that the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity. For example, the error in step 7 was caused by trying to place a boiler at a location that was either occupied or unplaceable.\n* Errors when entities are not connected to power network\n  - Ensure that entities requiring power are connected to a power network. For example, the pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5) is not connected to a power network.\n* Errors when entities are not connected properly\n  - Ensure that entities are connected properly. For example, the offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) is not connected.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
