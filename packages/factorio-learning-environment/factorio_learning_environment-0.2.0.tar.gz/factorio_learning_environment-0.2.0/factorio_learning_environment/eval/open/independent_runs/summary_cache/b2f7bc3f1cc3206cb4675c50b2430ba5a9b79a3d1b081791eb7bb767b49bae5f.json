{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. All attempts to create and supply a Lab (intended for Automation Science Pack research) at (0.5, 2.5) have failed, and no alternative building complexes have been added.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities Misuse \u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional parameters when calling get_entities. Always confirm the function\u2019s signature before use.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Issues \u2013 Repeated lab crafting failures stem from missing sub-ingredients (such as iron\u2010gear\u2010wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) and insufficient intermediate products (iron-plate, copper-plate). Also, lab placement attempts fail when no lab is present in inventory. Ensure that all prerequisites are met and the lab is available before placement.\n\u2022 Iteration on NoneType \u2013 Filtering operations on a None value (for example, when existing lab entities are expected) cause TypeErrors. Apply fallback measures (e.g., substituting with an empty list) to prevent iterating over None."}
