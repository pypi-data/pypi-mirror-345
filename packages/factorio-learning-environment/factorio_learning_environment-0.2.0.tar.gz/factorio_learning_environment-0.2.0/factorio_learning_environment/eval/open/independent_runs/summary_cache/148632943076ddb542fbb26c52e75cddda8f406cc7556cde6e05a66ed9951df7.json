{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Production Line at (-73.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron ore:\n- First stone furnace at position (3.0, -73.0)\n- Second stone furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational, containing coal as fuel and have iron plates as output. Each furnace currently has:\n- First furnace: 27 coal units as fuel, 13 iron plates as output\n- Second furnace: 23 coal units as fuel, 13 iron plates as output\nCurrently waiting for new ingredients to smelt\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (-21.0, -73.0) targeting copper ore deposit\n- Stone furnace at (-19.0, -74.0)\n- Iron chest at (-21.5, -74.5) to collect copper ore from drill\n- Burner inserter at (-20.5, -74.5) moving items from chest to furnace\nCurrent status:\n- Mining drill has 6 coal units as fuel\n- Furnace has 14 coal units as fuel and 75 copper plates\n- Inserter has 18 coal units as fuel\n- System is operational with proper material flow\n\n###Iron Mining and Smelting Setup at (-76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (-2.0, -76.0) targeting iron ore deposit\n- Iron chest at (-2.5, -77.5) to collect iron ore from drill\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, -77.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-1.5, -77.5) moving items from chest to furnace\nCurrent status:\n- Mining drill has 7 coal units as fuel\n- Furnace has 18 coal units as fuel and 9 iron plates\n- Inserter has 19 coal units as fuel\n- System is operational with iron ore flowing\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Entity Placement Spacing Issues\n- When placing a furnace near a mining drill, ensure there is adequate clear space at the drop position\n- Check if the target location for furnace placement is actually empty and accessible\n- Consider the tile dimensions of both the mining drill (2x2) and furnace (2x2) when planning placement\n\n###Inventory Management\n- Always check inventory before attempting to insert items\n- Ensure you have the required items (like coal) before attempting insertion operations\n\n###Inserter Setup Issues\n- Ensure there is proper space for inserters to drop items at their destination\n- Check that the destination entity can accept the items being inserted\n- Verify the inserter's drop position aligns with a valid input position of the target entity"}
