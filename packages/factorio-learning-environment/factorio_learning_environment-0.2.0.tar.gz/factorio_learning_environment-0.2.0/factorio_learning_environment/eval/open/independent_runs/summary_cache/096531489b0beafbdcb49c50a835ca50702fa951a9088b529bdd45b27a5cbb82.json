Always retrieve the current valid fluid_system (currently [37260]) from the boiler or offshore pump before initiating a connection.\n- Rigid Pipeline Stabilization:\n  \u2022 A fixed 10-second delay for pipeline stabilization leads to premature connection attempts. Use dynamic connectivity checks to confirm PipeGroup readiness.\n- Persistently Failed Steam Engine Connection:\n  \u2022 Continuous failures to connect the steam engine indicate misalignment or mismatched connection configurations. Reassess spatial arrangements and verify fluid system compatibility prior to connection."}
