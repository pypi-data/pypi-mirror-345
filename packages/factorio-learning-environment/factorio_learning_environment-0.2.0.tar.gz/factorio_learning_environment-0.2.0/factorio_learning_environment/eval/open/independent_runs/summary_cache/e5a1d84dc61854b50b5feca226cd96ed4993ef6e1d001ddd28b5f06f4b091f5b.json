{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine, including:\n  - Pipe at Position (x=1.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe-to-ground at Position (x=16.5, y=17.5)\n  - Various connecting pipes forming PipeGroups for steam and water transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and that there is a clear path between them. The repeated failure to connect pipes from Position (x=1.5, y=21.5) to Position (x=17.5, y=20.5) indicates a possible obstruction or mismatch in entity types.\n\n### Errors when Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Before attempting to place a small electric pole, verify that there is an available and suitable position for placement. This will prevent errors related to finding a suitable position.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(start: Position, end: Position, prototypes: Set[Prototype])`: Attempts to connect entities between two positions using specified prototypes. Failure mode includes inability to connect due to incompatible entities or obstructions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of pipe connections attempted between specific positions.\n- `inventory`: Dictionary tracking current inventory items and their quantities."}
