{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-11.5, 69.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 69.5)\n- Boiler at position(-6.0, 71.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, 75.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups for water and steam\nThe system is fully operational with the steam engine working and the boiler now fueled with coal.\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at Position(27.5, 85.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 at position(27.5, 85.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 at position(30.5, 85.5)\n- Small electric pole at position(29.5, 83.5)\n- Both drills are operational and connected to power, mining iron ore at a rate of approximately 84 iron ore per minute.\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at Position(28.0, 88.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 at position(28.0, 88.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone furnace 2 at position(31.0, 88.0) with coal fuel\n- Burner inserter 1 at position(28.5, 89.5) with coal fuel\n- Burner inserter 2 at position(31.5, 89.5) with coal fuel\n- Wooden chest 1 at position(28.5, 90.5) storing iron plates\n- Wooden chest 2 at position(31.5, 90.5) storing iron plates\nThe smelting area is operational, producing approximately 38 iron plates per minute, which are being stored in the wooden chests.\n\n### Assembly Area at Position(33.5, 98.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at position(33.5, 98.5)\n- Small electric pole at position(32.5, 96.5)\nThe assembling machine is set to produce iron gear wheels but is currently lacking iron plate inputs.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small electric poles connecting the steam engine to the mining drills and assembling machine\n- Electricity group with ID 3016 spanning from the steam engine to the production areas\nThe power network is operational with sufficient voltage (3297956) to power all connected electric entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where others already exist\n- Check if an entity already exists at the target position before placing a new one\n- Remove existing entities first if you need to replace them\n- Example: \"Could not place transport-belt at (30.5, 87.5), entity already exists at the target position\"\n\n### Errors when placing entities too close to other structures\n- Ensure there is enough space around the target position for the new entity\n- When placing belts near furnaces, leave at least one tile of space\n- Example: \"Could not find a suitable position to place transport-belt at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way\"\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Ensure inserters have enough space for their base and arm movement\n- Check that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are valid and accessible\n- When placing inserters near assembling machines, ensure they are positioned correctly relative to the machine's input/output points\n- Example: \"Could not place burner-inserter at (32.5, 98.5), Could not find a suitable position to place burner-inserter at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way\"\n\n### Errors when placing entities on invalid terrain\n- Check the terrain before placing entities to ensure it's not water or otherwise unplaceable\n- Scout the area first to find suitable placement locations\n- Example: \"Cannot place burner-inserter at the target location - something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable (water)\"\n\n### Errors when connecting entities that are too far apart\n- When connecting entities with belts or pipes, ensure there is a valid path between them\n- Use intermediate belts to create a valid path when connecting distant points\n\n### Errors when connecting fluid entities\n- Ensure boilers and steam engines are properly connected with pipes\n- Make sure connection points are not blocked and are properly aligned"}
