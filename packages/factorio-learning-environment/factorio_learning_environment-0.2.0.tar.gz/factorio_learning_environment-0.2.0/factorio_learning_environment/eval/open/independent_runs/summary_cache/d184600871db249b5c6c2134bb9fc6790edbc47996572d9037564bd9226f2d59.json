{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=-0.5 to x=0.5, y=6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine at position (x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Pipe groups connecting the offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-2.5, y=2.5) for feeding coal to boiler\n- Coal storage chest at position (x=-2.5, y=1.5)\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (x=16.0, y=9.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=16.0, y=9.0)\n- Wooden chest for coal collection at position (x=17.5, y=8.5)\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting (x=15.5, y=70.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (x=15.5, y=70.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (x=16.0, y=74.0)\n- Inserter at position (x=15.5, y=72.5) to move ore from drill to furnace\n- Inserter at position (x=16.5, y=75.5) to move plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest for iron plate collection at position (x=16.5, y=76.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting the components to power\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting (x=-46.5, y=76.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (x=-46.5, y=76.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (x=-46.0, y=80.0)\n- Inserter at position (x=-46.5, y=78.5) to move ore from drill to furnace\n- Inserter at position (x=-45.5, y=81.5) to move plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest for copper plate collection at position (x=-45.5, y=82.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting the components to power\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Assembly (x=26.5, y=76.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (x=26.5, y=76.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Inserter at position (x=24.5, y=76.5) to feed iron plates into assembler\n- Small electric poles connecting the components to power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where another entity already exists\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target position is already occupied\n- Increase spacing parameter when using place_entity_next_to function if the default spacing results in collisions\n- Consider using different directions when the default direction causes placement on an occupied tile\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts directly from chests\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a chest as a source\n- Always use an inserter to take items from a chest, then use the inserter as the source entity for belt connections\n\n### Errors when connecting from inserters with blocked drop positions\n- Ensure the drop position of an inserter is clear before trying to connect transport belts from it\n- Check if the drop position is already occupied by another entity (like a chest)\n- Reposition the inserter or the blocking entity to resolve the conflict\n\n### Errors with mining drill output\n- Several mining drills have \"output blocked\" warnings\n- Ensure there's a proper entity (like an inserter or belt) positioned to receive the output from mining drills\n\n### Errors with furnaces not smelting\n- Furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Ensure the input inserters are properly positioned and have power\n- Check that ore is being successfully transported from mining drills to furnaces"}
