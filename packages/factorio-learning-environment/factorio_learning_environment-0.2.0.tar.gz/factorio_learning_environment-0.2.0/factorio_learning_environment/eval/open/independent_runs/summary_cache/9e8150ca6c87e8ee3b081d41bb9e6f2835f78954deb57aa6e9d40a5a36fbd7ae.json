{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map as all attempts to place entities have failed. The agent's inventory includes items like burner mining drills and stone furnaces, but none have been successfully placed on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities is not occupied and is suitable for the specific entity type. The agent frequently encountered issues with placing Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces at various locations.\n\n### Errors due to unbuildable spots\n- When attempting to place a Burner Mining Drill, ensure that there is a viable buildable spot. The agent repeatedly failed to find a suitable location due to the BuildingBox size. Consider adjusting the BuildingBox size or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes.\n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. The agent encountered a `NameError` due to an undefined variable 'furnace'.\n\n### Errors with moving to positions\n- When moving to a new position, ensure that the indices used are integers. The agent faced exceptions due to using string indices instead of integers.\n\n### Errors with API usage\n- Review API documentation to ensure correct usage. The agent encountered errors related to incorrect API calls, such as using string indices where integers were expected.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in placing structures and managing resources on the map."}
