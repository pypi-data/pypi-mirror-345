{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=54.5, y=-84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-15.5, y=-64.5) transferring iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore and copper plates.\n\n### Iron Ore and Plate Storage Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Function Argument Usage\n- Ensure that all required positional arguments are provided when calling functions. For example, the error in line 13 indicates a missing argument in the function `_modifier()`.\n\n### Inserter Source Item Errors\n- Ensure that inserters have a supply of source items to transfer. The error at position (x=-16.5, y=-69.5) suggests checking the supply to the inserter.\n\n### Inserter Destination Errors\n- Ensure that there is a valid nearby entity to accept items from inserters. The error in line 42 indicates a failure to find a nearby entity to accept iron plates.\n\n### Belt Placement and Removal\n- Avoid placing unnecessary belts, and ensure alignment when placing belts. The removal of unnecessary belts in multiple positions highlights the need for careful belt placement.\n\n### Inserter Output Blockage\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to drop items and that the destination is not blocked. The warning at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) indicates an output blockage.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Supply\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The warning at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) indicates a lack of ingredients for the furnace to process."}
