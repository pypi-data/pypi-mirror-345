{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) collecting copper plates\n\n### Iron Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- 4 Stone furnaces in a row at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- 4 Input burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5)\n- 4 Output burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- 4 Input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) containing coal\n- 4 Output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- 3 Burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), and (-6.0, -59.0)\n- 3 Output wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Drill Output Issues\n- When placing mining drills, ensure there is a valid output entity (like a chest or furnace) exactly at the drill's drop position to prevent \"output blocked\" warnings\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep machines fueled - multiple drills are showing \"out of fuel\" warnings\n- Consider setting up automated fuel delivery systems for longer-term operation\n\n### Entity Placement\n- When building production lines, verify exact positions of all components before placement\n- Ensure drop positions of mining drills align perfectly with input positions of furnaces or chests\n- Double check that inserters can reach both their pickup and drop positions when placing them"}
