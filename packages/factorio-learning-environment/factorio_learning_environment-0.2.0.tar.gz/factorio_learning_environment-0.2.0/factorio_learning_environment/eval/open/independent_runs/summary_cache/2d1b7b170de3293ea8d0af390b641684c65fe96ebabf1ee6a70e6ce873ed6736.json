{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of 4 stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) \n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients but have coal fuel\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around y=24, consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) connected via pipes to pump\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5) connected via pipes to boiler\n- Small electric poles connecting power to other structures\nSystem is partially working but boiler needs fuel\n\n### Research Lab\nLab structure at (10.5, 0.5) with:\n- 2 automation science packs loaded\n- Connected to power network\n- Currently not researching due to no power\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with crafting items requiring machines\n- Items like copper plates, iron plates need furnaces for smelting\n- Cannot craft these directly from inventory\n- Need to place ore and fuel in furnaces first\n\n### Errors with missing ingredients\n- Check recipe requirements before attempting to craft\n- Ensure all required raw materials are gathered first\n- For example, wood needs to be harvested before crafting wooden poles\n\n### Errors with placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required entity in inventory before trying to place it\n- Check entity placement requirements (water for pumps etc)\n\n### Errors with connecting entities\n- Need to have connection items (like pipes) in inventory before connecting structures\n- Ensure entities are within connection range\n\n### Errors with machine operation\n- Machines need proper inputs to function:\n  - Furnaces need both fuel and ore\n  - Boilers need fuel and water\n  - Labs need power and science packs\n\n### Programming/API Errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations on model attributes directly\n- Need to access the actual numeric values first"}
