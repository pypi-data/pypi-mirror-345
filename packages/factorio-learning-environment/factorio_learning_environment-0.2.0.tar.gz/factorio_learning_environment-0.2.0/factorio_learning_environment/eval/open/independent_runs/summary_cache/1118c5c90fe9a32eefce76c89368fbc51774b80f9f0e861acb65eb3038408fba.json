{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Setup (around x=41, y=-82)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Multiple storage chests:\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for immediate drill output\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) with coal storage\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -84.5) with coal storage\n\n### Coal Transport System (around x=43, y=-81)\n- Chest output inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from wooden chest to belt\n- Belt system consisting of:\n  - Belt at (43.5, -80.5)\n  - Belt at (43.5, -81.5)\n  - Belt at (43.5, -82.5)\n  - Belt at (44.5, -82.5)\n- Furnace input inserter at (45.5, -82.5)\n\n### Smelting Setup (around x=46, y=-81)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Output storage chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other objects\n   - Pay attention to entity sizes - some entities like furnaces occupy 2x2 tiles\n   - Ensure proper spacing between belts and inserters\n\n2. Transport System Issues\n   - Ensure belt paths are properly connected without gaps\n   - Check that inserters have correct pickup and drop positions\n   - Monitor for belt blockages and chest capacity issues\n\n3. Resource Flow Problems\n   - Clear blocked transport belts to maintain resource flow\n   - Empty full chests to prevent mining stoppage\n   - Ensure proper fuel distribution to all burner entities\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- transport_belt: TransportBelt\n- storage_chest: Chest\n- furnace: Furnace\n\nEntity States:\n- WORKING: Entity is functioning normally\n- WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Output is blocked\n- WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Input is empty\n- NO_INGREDIENTS: Missing required materials\n- NORMAL: Default operational state"}
