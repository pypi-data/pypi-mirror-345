{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Currently smelting iron ore to produce iron plates\n\n### Additional Iron Smelting Facility at Position (3.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 0.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Currently smelting iron ore to produce iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Actively mining iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) to collect iron ore\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-18.0, -72.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-18.0, -72.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Actively mining iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-18.5, -73.5) to collect iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Setup at Position (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-28.0, -61.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Actively mining copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-28.5, -62.5) to collect copper ore\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-4.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-4.0, -53.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Actively mining iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-4.5, -54.5) to collect iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, a stone furnace must be crafted or available in the inventory before placement.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient smelting output\n- Ensure that the furnace has completed smelting before attempting to extract items. Verify the smelting process and wait until the required number of iron plates are produced.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Make sure the entity contains the expected items before attempting extraction. Check the furnace's contents to confirm the presence of iron plates before extracting.\n\n### Assertion errors due to unmet conditions\n- Verify that the conditions for assertions are met before executing them. For example, ensure that the required number of iron plates is smelted before asserting their count.\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Ensure all sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates must be smelted before crafting a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, ensure you have coal before inserting it into a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is limited, so ensure you are within range.\n\n### Assertion errors due to incorrect inventory counts\n- Double-check inventory counts before making assertions. Ensure that the expected number of items is present in the inventory before asserting their count.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Remove any existing entities from the target position before placing a new one.\n\n### TypeError due to incorrect function arguments\n- Verify the function signature and ensure that the correct arguments are passed. For example, check that the 'position' argument is expected by the function being called.\n\n### Errors due to relocation of mining drills to non-minable areas\n- Ensure that the area where a mining drill is placed contains minable resources. Check the resource availability before placing or relocating mining drills.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract from an empty entity\n- Ensure that the entity has the items you intend to extract. For example, verify that the chest contains iron ore before attempting to extract it.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items not present in the inventory\n- Ensure that the items you are trying to insert into an entity are available in your inventory. For example, make sure you have coal before attempting to insert it into a burner mining drill."}
