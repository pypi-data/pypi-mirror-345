Remove any existing entities before attempting to place a new pipe.\n- Verify that you have the necessary pipes or pipe-to-ground in your inventory before attempting to reconnect pipes.\n- Move closer to the target position when placing pipes if the distance is too far; the maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors in Research Initiation\n- Ensure that the research technology is correctly specified and available before attempting to initiate research.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items\n- Double-check the attribute names when crafting items. For example, use the correct attribute 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround' if applicable.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, make sure the target tile is unoccupied and within the allowable placement distance."}
