Ensure that the entity exists at the specified coordinates before attempting to access it.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The same errors regarding electric pole placement and steam engine retrieval have occurred multiple times. It is advisable to check the map for potential obstructions and confirm the existence of entities at the specified positions before executing commands."}
