{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts were made to create a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded because no Lab item was available in inventory and crafting efforts did not yield a completed Lab. In addition, while existing furnaces (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron smelting and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper smelting) were retrieved and utilized in processing resources, these installations were not constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Issues\n  - When retrieving entities, ensure that the function is invoked with the correct parameters. Passing unsupported keywords (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or unexpected positional arguments leads to TypeError; verify the proper function signature before calling.\n\n\u2022 Handling Empty or Invalid Returns\n  - Check whether retrieval functions (like get_entities) return a valid list before iterating over their results. Using None without validation can result in a \u201cNoneType\u201d error; apply a fallback to an empty list as needed.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Resource Shortages\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), confirm that the Lab is actually available in the inventory.\n  - For Lab crafting, ensure that all required sub-components (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables along with their dependent resources such as iron-plates and copper-plates) are sufficiently available or producible.\n  - Review the production sequence for intermediate items so that resource shortages do not inhibit Lab crafting."}
