{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (40.5, -80.5)\n- Iron Chest at Position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (43.5, -80.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (41.5, -79.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (41.5, -78.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (41.5, -77.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-9.5, -49.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\n- Iron Chest at Position (-14.5, -47.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-14.5, -46.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-14.5, -45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items\n- Ensure you are within range of the target entity before attempting to extract items. This includes coal from the coal chest at (41.5, -80.5) and iron ore from the ore chest at (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### Errors When Transferring Items to Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients before attempting to transfer items. This includes ensuring iron ore is available for furnaces at positions (43.0, -82.0), (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0).\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations. This includes the chest at the drop position (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### Undefined Variables in Code\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use to avoid errors such as \"name 'new_coal_storage_2' is not defined\"."}
