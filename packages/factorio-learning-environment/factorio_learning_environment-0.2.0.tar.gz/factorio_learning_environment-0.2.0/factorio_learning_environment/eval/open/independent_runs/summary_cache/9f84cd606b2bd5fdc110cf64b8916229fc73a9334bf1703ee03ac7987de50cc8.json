The lab at position (5.5, -12.5) is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Errors when inspecting electric connections\n- Verify that the object being inspected has the correct attributes. The error indicates that the 'ElectricityGroup' object does not have an 'energy' attribute. Check the object structure and ensure you are accessing the correct properties.\n\n### Errors when connecting structures\n- Double-check the connections between entities to ensure they are properly linked to the power grid. The steam engine and offshore pump are currently not connected.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. This applies to all structures that may overlap with existing entities."}
