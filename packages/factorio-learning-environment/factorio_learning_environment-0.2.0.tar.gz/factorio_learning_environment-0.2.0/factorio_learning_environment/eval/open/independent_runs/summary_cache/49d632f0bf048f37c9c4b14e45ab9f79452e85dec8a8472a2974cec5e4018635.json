{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(12.93, 10.71)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric pole (position x1)\n- Electricity group (position x=12.93, y=10.71)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-28.5, -61.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1)\n- Furnace (position y1)\n\n### Iron plate mine at position(-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x2)\n- Furnace (position y2)\n\n### Stone furnace factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position x=0.0, y=0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Stone furnace (position x=2.0, y=0.0) - Status: WORKING\n- Stone furnace (position x=2.0, y=2.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Lab at position(10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position x=10.5, y=10.5) - Status: NO_POWER\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when trying to access a non-existent entity\n- Verify the position of the entity before attempting to access it. For example, the lab at position (6.0, 0.0) does not exist.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Ensure that all electric entities are properly connected to the electric network to avoid power-related issues. For example, the lab at position (10.5, 10.5) is currently without power."}
