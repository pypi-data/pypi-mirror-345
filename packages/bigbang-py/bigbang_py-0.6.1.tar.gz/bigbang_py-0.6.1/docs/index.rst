Welcome to BigBang's documentation!
===================================

``BigBang`` is a toolkit for studying processes of open collaboration and deliberation, especially with respect to the production of digital infrastructures, to make them more transparent and accountable. This is achieved by utilising public communication channels and documents to reveal which actors are leading, following, or left out. It enables the analysis and visualisation of relationships, discourses, time series and knowledge networks.

``BigBang`` is a community of researchers sharing code and best practices. ``BigBang`` comes with a large directory of `examples <https://github.com/datactive/bigbang/tree/main/examples>`_ showcasing what kind of questions can be answered through the communications data. These examples are designed as tutorial and support data science and research pedagogy.
