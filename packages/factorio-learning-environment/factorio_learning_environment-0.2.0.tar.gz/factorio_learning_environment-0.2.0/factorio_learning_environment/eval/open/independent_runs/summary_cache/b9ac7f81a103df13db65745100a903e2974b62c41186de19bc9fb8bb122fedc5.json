For example, wood must be gathered before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. For instance, ensure no existing object is in the way when placing a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Make sure that all electrical entities are connected to a power source and receiving electricity. Check connections between power poles and ensure the generator is operational."}
