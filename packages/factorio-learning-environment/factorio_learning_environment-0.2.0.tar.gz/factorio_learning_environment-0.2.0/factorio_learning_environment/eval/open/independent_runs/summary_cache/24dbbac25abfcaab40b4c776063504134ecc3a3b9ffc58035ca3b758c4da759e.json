{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of four stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) \n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have coal fuel but currently have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipe network between pump and boiler\n- Connected pipe network between boiler and steam engine\n- Small electric pole at (6.5, 24.5)\nThe system is partially working - pump is operational but boiler needs fuel and steam engine is not fully connected to power network.\n\n### Research Lab Area\nLab placed at (10.5, 0.5) with:\n- 2 automation science packs loaded\n- Connected to power network via electric poles\n- Currently in working status\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory requirement errors\n- Check if required items are in inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Ensure you have crafted prerequisite items before attempting to craft complex items\n- Raw resources like wood need to be gathered, they cannot be crafted\n\n### Crafting system errors\n- Items like iron plates and copper plates must be smelted in furnaces, they cannot be directly crafted\n- Ensure all ingredients for complex recipes are available before attempting to craft\n\n### Power system errors\n- Ensure all power system components are properly connected\n- Boilers need constant fuel supply to operate\n- Steam engines need to be connected to power network via electric poles\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- When placing connected entities (like pipes), ensure you have enough of the connecting pieces in inventory\n- Check entity dimensions and space requirements before placement\n\n### Recipe requirement errors\n- For complex items requiring multiple ingredients, ensure you have crafted all prerequisite items\n- Some items require specific machines (like assembling machines) to be crafted"}
