{"content": "# The nearby entities information indicates that there is a stone furnace present at the position, which has fuel (coal) but is currently showing a status of \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" and has warnings about lacking ingredients to smelt.\n#\n# However, this information does not directly relate to the harvesting issue, as the furnace is not involved in the harvesting process itself. It does suggest that the furnace is not currently operational due to a lack of input materials, but this is separate from the inability to harvest resources.\n#\n# Given the persistent failures to harvest resources and the lack of any apparent issues with the inventory or nearby entities, it may be necessary to consider the following:\n1. **Re-evaluate the harvesting method**: Ensure that the correct harvesting method is being used and that the position is indeed valid for harvesting.\n2. **Check for any environmental constraints**: There may be game-specific rules or environmental factors affecting harvesting that are not immediately apparent.\n3. **Restart the harvesting process**: Sometimes, resetting the environment or re-initializing the harvesting process can resolve unexpected issues.\n\nTo proceed, I will attempt to reset the harvesting process by moving away from the current position and then returning to see if it resolves the issue.\n\n# Moving away from the current position to reset the harvesting context.\nmove_to(Position(x=-20.0, y=20.0))  # Move to a different position away from the resource patch.", "summary_range": "[1-172]"}
