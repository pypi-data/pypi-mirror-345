{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 22.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 22.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 17.5)\n\n### Coal Extraction and Storage\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0)\n\n### Inserter Operations\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position (19.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position (20.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are properly aligned and positioned to connect the boiler at position (-3.5, 22.0) to the steam engine at position (-0.5, 17.5). Verify that there are no obstructions and that the correct type of pipes are being used.\n\n### Errors When Accessing Non-Existent Entities\n- Verify the existence of entities before attempting to interact with them. For example, ensure that a lab exists at the specified position (25.0, 25.0) before trying to access it.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Not Present in Inventory\n- Confirm that the items you wish to insert, such as automation science packs, are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity."}
