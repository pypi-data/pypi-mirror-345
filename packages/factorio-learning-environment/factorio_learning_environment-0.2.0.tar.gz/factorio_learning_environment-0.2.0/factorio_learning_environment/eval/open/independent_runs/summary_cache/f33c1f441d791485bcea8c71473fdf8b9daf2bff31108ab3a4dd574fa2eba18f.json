This structure supports resource preparation for subsequent crafting efforts.\n\n### Copper Plate Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of a furnace at (-27.0, -60.0) that processes copper ore and coal into copper plates. These copper plates serve as the basis for producing copper cables for further manufacturing.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Correct API usage for entity retrieval:\n  - When calling get_entities, ensure that the parameters match the function signature. Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as 'radius') or supplying extra positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting and placement pitfalls:\n  - Confirm that the lab item exists in the inventory before attempting placement at a specified location.\n  - Verify that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available prior to initiating lab crafting.\n  - Implement robust fallback checks to handle cases where entity-retrieval functions return None, thus preventing iteration over a NoneType.\n\n\u2022 Resource preparation and dependency management:\n  - Ensure prerequisite smelting operations are completed to generate sufficient base materials.\n  - Validate overall resource availability to avoid cascading failures in crafting complex items like the lab."}
