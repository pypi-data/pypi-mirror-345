{"content": "Ah, I see the error. We need to check our inventory first and collect more coal before setting up the mining drills.\n\n```python\n# First check our current inventory\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Collect more coal\ncoal_pos = nearest(Resource.Coal)\nmove_to(coal_pos)\ncoal_collected = harvest_resource(coal_pos, quantity=50)\nassert coal_collected > 0, \"Failed to collect coal\"\n\n# Now let's try setting up our mining drills again\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# Place first mining drill\ndrill1 = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, position=iron_pos)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill1, quantity=5)\n\n# Place second drill nearby\ndrill2 = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    reference_position=drill1.position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n    spacing=1\n)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill2, quantity=5)\n\n# Print final state\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(\"Mining setup:\")\nprint(get_entities())\n```\n\nKey Lessons Learned:\n1. Always verify inventory before attempting to use items\n2. Maintain sufficient fuel (coal) supplies for burner-based equipment\n3. Resource collection should be done in batches to ensure enough materials\n4. Use assertions to catch failures early\n5. Structure code in logical steps:\n   - Collect resources\n   - Craft items\n   - Place/setup automation\n   - Fuel equipment\n\nPattern for Automation Setup:\n```python\n# Resource Collection Pattern\ndef collect_resources(resource_type, quantity):\n    pos = nearest(resource_type)\n    move_to(pos)\n    collected = harvest_resource(pos, quantity)\n    assert collected > 0, f\"Failed to collect {resource_type}\"\n    return collected\n\n# Equipment Setup Pattern\ndef setup_burner_equipment(equipment_type, position, fuel_quantity):\n    equipment = place_entity(equipment_type, position)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, equipment, quantity=fuel_quantity)\n    return equipment\n```\n\nThese patterns help ensure reliable automation setup and resource management.", "summary_range": "[1-10]"}
