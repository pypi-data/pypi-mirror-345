{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nThis facility is responsible for extracting iron ore and converting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Drops iron ore into a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Warning: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: Coal (11 units)\n    - Status: Working\n    - Ingredients: Iron ore (6 units)\n    - Produces: Iron plates (81 units)\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: Coal (15 units)\n    - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n    - Produces: Iron plates (77 units)\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: Coal (20 units)\n    - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n    - Produces: Iron plates (66 units)\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of several chests used for storing resources and products:\n\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Position (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5)\n  - Status: Normal, Inventory: Empty\n  - Position (4.5, -58.5)\n    - Inventory: Iron ore (5 units)\n  - Position (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5)\n    - Inventory: Empty\n  - Position (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5)\n    - Inventory: Iron plates (1600 units each)\n    - Warning: Chest is full\n  - Position (-7.5, -50.5)\n    - Inventory: Iron plates (315 units)\n\n- **Iron Chests**:\n  - Position (-6.5, -50.5)\n    - Inventory: Empty\n  - Position (-5.5, -50.5)\n    - Inventory: Iron plates (790 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Warnings for Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for collecting resources or products are regularly emptied to prevent production halts. Specifically, the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) needs to be emptied to allow the mining drill to continue operation.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Regularly supply stone furnaces with the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to maintain continuous production. Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) are currently not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_chest_position: Tuple[float, float] = (4.5, -58.5)`\n- `furnace_positions: List[Tuple[float, float]] = [(-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0)]`\n- `iron_plate_inventory: Dict[str, int] = {'iron-plate': 3869}`\n\nThese variables represent the positions of key entities and the current inventory status of iron plates."}
