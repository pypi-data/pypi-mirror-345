{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a report summarizing the structures and error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex at (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill and stone furnace setup for copper/iron mining\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing iron and copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving items from furnace to chest\n- Additional furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n\n### Large Iron Mining Operation at (-10.0, -59.0)\nConsists of three mining drills in sequence:\n- Mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0) with transport belts\n- Mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0) with chest and inserter system\n- Mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0) with transport belt connections\n- Collection chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters managing item movement between components\n\n### Main Smelting Facility at (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces in sequence at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chest system with wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chest system with wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserters managing input and output for each furnace\n- Transport belt system connecting mining operation to smelting facility\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Connection Errors\n- When connecting transport belts between distant points, ensure there is a valid path between start and end positions\n- Check if the target position for belt connection is within reach and accessible\n\n### Inserter Operation Issues\n- Clear space in destination chests when \"waiting for space in destination\" warning appears\n- Ensure proper fuel supply for burner inserters to maintain continuous operation\n- Place appropriate destination entities for inserters to prevent \"output blocked\" warnings\n\n### Mining System Blockages\n- Monitor and empty full chests regularly to prevent mining system blockages\n- Maintain fuel supply in mining drills to prevent \"out of fuel\" status\n- Ensure proper connection between mining drills and their output systems\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Keep furnaces supplied with both fuel and ingredients to prevent \"no ingredients to smelt\" status\n- Ensure output paths from furnaces are clear to maintain continuous operation"}
