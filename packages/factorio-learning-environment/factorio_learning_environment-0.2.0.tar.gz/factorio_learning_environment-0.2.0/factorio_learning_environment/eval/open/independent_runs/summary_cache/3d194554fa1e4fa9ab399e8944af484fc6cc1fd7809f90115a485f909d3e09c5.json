{"content": "## REPORT\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items, connected to a stone furnace and transport belts.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) working, connected to a stone furnace and transport belts.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items, connected to transport belts.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) waiting for space in destination, connected to transport belts and a wooden chest.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for space in destination, connected to transport belts and an iron chest.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-9.5, y=-44.5) waiting for source items, connected to transport belts.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-43.5) waiting for source items, connected to transport belts.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) containing iron plates.\n- **Transport Belts**:\n  - Multiple belts connecting the furnaces, inserters, and chests, facilitating the movement of items across the facility.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of items to pick up. Check the connections and supply lines to ensure they are not interrupted.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination for the inserters is not full. Consider adding more storage or processing capacity to prevent blockage.\n\n#### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from inserters. This can be achieved by connecting the inserter to a chest or another processing unit that can handle the output."}
