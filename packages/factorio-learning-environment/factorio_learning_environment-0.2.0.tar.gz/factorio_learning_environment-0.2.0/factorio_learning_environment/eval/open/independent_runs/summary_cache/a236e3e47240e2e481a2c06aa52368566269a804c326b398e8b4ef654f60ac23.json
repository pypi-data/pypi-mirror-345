{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=27.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=27.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED and warnings ['no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections']\n- Steam engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED and warnings ['not connected to power network', 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections']\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) and another at position (x=0.5, y=30.5), both with status WORKING\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pumps and the boiler, with multiple pipe groups at various positions, some of which are EMPTY and others WORKING\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS and warnings ['no ingredients to smelt']\n- Inserters at positions (x=17.5, y=0.5) and (x=16.5, y=0.5) with status NO_POWER and warnings ['inserter waiting for source items', 'not connected to power network', 'not receiving electricity']\n- Wooden chests at positions (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=18.5, y=0.5) with status NORMAL\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, with some groups having fluid status WORKING and others EMPTY.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Callable Objects\n- Avoid using parentheses with objects that are not callable, such as positions. Use methods or properties like `.center` without parentheses if applicable.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the positions for connecting pipes are correctly aligned and within range. Check that the entities being connected are compatible and that there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors in Repeated Connection Attempts\n- If repeated attempts to connect pipes fail, verify the configuration and positioning of all involved entities. Consider repositioning entities to ensure proper alignment and connectivity.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Power\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power network. Check that the power poles are properly connected and that the inserters are within range of power supply.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Verify that fluid systems have a clear and unobstructed path between the source (offshore pump) and the destination (boiler). Ensure all pipes are properly connected and that there are no gaps in the fluid network."}
