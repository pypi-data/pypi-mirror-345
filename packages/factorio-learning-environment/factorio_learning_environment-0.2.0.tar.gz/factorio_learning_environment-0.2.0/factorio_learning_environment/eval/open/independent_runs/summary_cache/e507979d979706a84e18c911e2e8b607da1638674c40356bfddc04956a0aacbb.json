{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -49.0) and (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT, indicating it is producing iron plates but its output is currently blocked.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS, indicating it lacks the necessary ingredients to continue production.\n\n### Iron Plate Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace at (-16.0, -49.0) and a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt from position (-16.5, -48.5) to (-16.5, -46.5) facilitating the movement of items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace at (-14.0, -49.0) and a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt at position (-14.5, -46.5) connecting to a wooden chest at (-13.5, -46.5).\n\n### Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) holding iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) holding iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple transport belts connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of items across the facility.\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs facilitating the transport of iron plates, consisting of 5 belts in working status and 2 belts in empty status.\n\n### Inserter Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Burner Inserters at various positions (e.g., (-13.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), (-14.5, -43.5)) waiting for source items or space in the destination, indicating a need for better resource flow management.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that all entity types such as 'Inserter' and 'BurnerInserter' are correctly defined and available in the current context before using them.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Verify the presence of entities like 'stone-furnace' and 'transport-belt' at specified positions before attempting to interact with them.\n- Ensure that you are within the maximum allowable distance (10 units) from the target position when placing entities like transport belts to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Resource Flow\n- Regularly check the upstream supply for inserters waiting for source items to ensure continuous production and avoid bottlenecks.\n- Address blockages in the transport system to prevent inserters from waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of necessary items like transport belts to avoid running out during critical operations.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency and effectiveness of the production facility can be significantly improved."}
