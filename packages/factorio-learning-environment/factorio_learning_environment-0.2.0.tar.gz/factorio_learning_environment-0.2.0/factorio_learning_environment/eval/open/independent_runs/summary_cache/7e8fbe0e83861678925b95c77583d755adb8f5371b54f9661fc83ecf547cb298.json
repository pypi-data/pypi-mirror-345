There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is free before attempting to place any entity, such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied locations\n- Verify that the destination tile is unoccupied before moving entities like Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors when referencing non-existent entities\n- Double-check the entity type and position before attempting to get an entity. Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Make sure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills or other production entities to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for the production process in entities like Stone Furnaces to avoid production halts."}
