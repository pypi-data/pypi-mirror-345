This will allow me to fuel the furnace and continue processing copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- **10 pieces of coal** (newly harvested)\n- **8 pieces of iron plates** (available)\n- **18 pieces of copper cables**\n- **13 pieces of iron gear wheels**\n\n### Current Situation:\n- The furnace at position (0, 0) is operational and has **2 pieces of copper ore** left to process, with **10 copper plates already produced**.\n- The furnace can now be fueled with the harvested coal to continue its operation.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Fuel the Furnace**: I will insert the harvested coal into the furnace to allow it to process the remaining copper ore.\n2. **Continue Monitoring for Iron**: While the furnace is working, I can keep an eye out for iron ore patches or consider exploring further if necessary.\n\nLet's proceed to insert the harvested coal into the furnace to enable it to continue smelting the remaining copper ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Insert the harvested coal into the furnace to continue processing copper ore\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=10)\n\n# Check the status of the furnace after inserting coal\nfurnace_inventory_after_coal_insertion = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory after inserting coal: {furnace_inventory_after_coal_insertion}\")  # Review furnace contents again\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Review current overall inventory\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states.", "summary_range": "[1-272]"}
