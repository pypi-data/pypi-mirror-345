{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), which store extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), which transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), which smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), which stores produced iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), which is responsible for moving iron plates from the furnace to a storage chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), which stores the transferred iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all inserters have a sufficient supply of fuel to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from stopping.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space\n- Ensure that the destination of inserters is not full to avoid them waiting for space. Regularly transfer items from destination chests to prevent overflow.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source of inserters has sufficient items to transfer. Regularly supply source chests with necessary items to keep inserters operational.\n\n### Mining Drill Fuel Management\n- Ensure that mining drills have a sufficient supply of fuel to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check and refuel mining drills to prevent them from stopping.\n\n### Inventory Management for Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that you have the required items in your inventory. Regularly monitor inventory levels to avoid insertion errors."}
