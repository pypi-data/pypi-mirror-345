One steam engine was successfully crafted (Step 418) and initially placed at Position(x=8.5, y=17.5); however, multiple pipe connection attempts from the Boiler failed. Subsequent manual repositioning efforts\u2014aiming for Position(x=8.5, y=21.0)\u2014also encountered placement failures (either due to absence in inventory or due to target area obstructions), leaving the new engine\u2019s integration unresolved.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Crafting Failures for Steam Engines\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all required sub\u2010ingredients (such as iron plates and iron-gear-wheels) are available before commencing a steam engine craft. Verify that production chains and inventory levels for these intermediate items are sufficient to meet recipe demands.\n  \n\u2022 Pipe Connection Failures\n\u2003\u2013 When errors occur during pipe connections (e.g. failure to connect the Boiler at Position(x=8.0, y=20.5) with a nearby steam engine), check that both entities\u2019 connection points are clear, aligned, and within the allowable range. Also confirm that the pipe inventory is adequate and the surrounding area is free of obstructions.\n\n\u2022 Manual Placement and Repositioning Errors\n\u2003\u2013 Before issuing manual placement commands, verify that the targeted steam engine is present in the inventory and that the designated area is unoccupied. Obstructions or pre\u2010existing objects at the target coordinates can prevent successful placement.\n\n\u2022 Null Object and Attribute Errors in Connection Calculations\n\u2003\u2013 Errors such as \"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'position'\" indicate that an expected entity or its attribute is missing or uninitialized. Ensure that all relevant entity objects have been properly instantiated and that their positional data is valid prior to calculating pipe routing or connection requirements."}
