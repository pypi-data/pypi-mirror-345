{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (11, 20)\n- Boiler at position (10, 21)\n- Offshore Pump at position (9, 20)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (15, 25)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (15, 25) and a Furnace at position (16, 25)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (15, 26) and a Furnace at position (16, 26)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (15, 27) and a Furnace at position (16, 27)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (20, 30)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20, 30) and a Furnace at position (21, 30)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20, 31) and a Furnace at position (21, 31)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (25, 35) and a Furnace at position (26, 35)\n- Assembling Machine at position (27, 35) and Inserter at position (28, 35) that puts into the Assembling Machine\n- Belt group connecting the Furnace at position (26, 35) to the Assembling Machine at position (27, 35)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with Incorrect API Usage\n- Verify the API documentation to ensure correct function calls and parameters are used.\n\n### Errors in Conveyor Belt Direction\n- Double-check the direction of conveyor belts to ensure they are aligned with the intended flow of materials.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity(entity_type: str, position: Tuple[int, int]) -> bool`: Attempts to place an entity of the specified type at the given position. Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise. Common failure mode: Attempting to place on an occupied tile.\n- `extract_items(entity_id: int) -> List[Item]`: Extracts items from the specified entity. Ensure proximity to the entity to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_position: Tuple[int, int]`: Tracks the agent's current position on the map.\n- `inventory: Dict[str, int]`: Maintains a count of items in the agent's inventory.\n- `energy_level: int`: Represents the current energy level available for operations."}
