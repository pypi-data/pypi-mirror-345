{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully established on the map. The agent made repeated attempts to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) to enable the supply of Automation Science Packs for research. Despite several recovery updates and fallback approaches, none of these Lab placements succeeded due to missing inventory and resource dependencies. Although existing smelting facilities (an iron furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)) were accessed and used for processing resources, no new building structures were directly created by the agent in these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Invocation Errors\n  - When calling get_entities, avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. using \u201cradius\u201d) and verify that the number and type of arguments match the API\u2019s expected signature.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Iteration Issues\n  - Ensure that the required Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting to place one at (0.5, 2.5).\n  - When filtering for Lab entities, confirm that the returned collection is not None (or apply a fallback to an empty list) to prevent iteration errors.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages\n  - Verify that all sub-components needed for Lab crafting\u2014such as iron-gear-wheels and electronic-circuits (which depend on sufficient quantities of iron-plates, copper-plates, and copper-cables)\u2014are available.\n  - Reassess resource processing steps to guarantee that prerequisite smelting and crafting operations are completing successfully prior to initiating Lab production."}
