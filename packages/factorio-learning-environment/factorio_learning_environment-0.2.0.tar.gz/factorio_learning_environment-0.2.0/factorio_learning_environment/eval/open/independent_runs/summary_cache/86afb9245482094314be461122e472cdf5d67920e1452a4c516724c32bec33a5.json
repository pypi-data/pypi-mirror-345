{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled with coal and producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) fueled with coal and producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 1.5) transferring items between furnaces.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 1.5) transferring items between furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Raw Materials\n- Ensure all required raw materials are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, wood must be gathered directly as it cannot be crafted.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider adjusting the position or direction if placement fails.\n\n### Errors Due to Undefined Variables\n- Ensure that variables are properly defined before use. Double-check spelling and initialization of variables like `first_chest`.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Confirm that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before inserting it into an inserter.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. If an entity is not found, ensure the position is correct and the entity exists."}
