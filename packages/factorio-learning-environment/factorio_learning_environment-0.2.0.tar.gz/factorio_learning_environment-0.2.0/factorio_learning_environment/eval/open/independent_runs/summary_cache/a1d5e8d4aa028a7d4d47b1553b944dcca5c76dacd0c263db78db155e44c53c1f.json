{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone mine at position(-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill at position(-46.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest at position(-45.5, 1.5)\n\n### Stone furnace at position(-43.0, 2.0)\nConsists of \n- Stone furnace at position(-43.0, 2.0)\n\n### New Stone mine at position(-47.5, 4.5)\nConsists of \n- Electric mining drill at position(-47.5, 4.5)\n- Small electric pole at position(-47.5, 6.5)\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 0.0)\nConsists of \n- Boiler at position(0.5, 0.0)\n- Steam engine at position(5.5, 0.5)\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Electricity network connecting small electric pole to steam engine\n\n### New Steam Engine at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of \n- Steam engine at position(2.5, 0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when accessing entities that do not exist on the map\n  - Ensure that the required entities exist on the map before attempting to access them.\n  - For example, attempting to access a Steam Engine when none are present on the map will result in an error.\n* Errors when accessing an empty list\n  - Check if the list is empty before attempting to access its elements. \n* Errors when getting an entity that does not exist at a specific position\n  - Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to access it.\n* Errors when nearest entity is not found\n  - Ensure that the required entity exists on the map before attempting to access the nearest one.\n* Errors when placing entities too far away\n  - Make sure to move to the target position before attempting to place an entity. \n  - The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n* Errors when crafting items without required resources or machines\n  - Ensure that you have the required resources and machines before attempting to craft an item.\n  - Stone-brick requires a furnace to be smelted.\n* Errors when crafting items that are raw resources\n  - Stone is a raw resource that must be gathered first.\n* Errors when furnace is not fueled\n  - Ensure that the furnace is fueled before attempting to smelt items.\n* Errors when chest is full\n  - Ensure that the chest is emptied before continuing to mine resources. For example, the warning in step 71, 87 and 88 occurred because the chest at (-45.5, 1.5) was full.\n* Errors when Burner Mining Drill is out of fuel\n  - Ensure that the Burner Mining Drill is fueled before continuing to mine resources.\n* Errors when researching a technology that is already researched\n  - Check the current research status before attempting to research a technology.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at a position occupied by another entity\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place an entity. For example, the error in step 85 occurred because there was an existing object in the way.\n* Errors when using non-existent technology or prototype\n  - Ensure that the technology or prototype exists before attempting to use it.\n* Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n  - Check if the inventory is full before attempting to insert items.\n* Errors when connecting entities without valid connections\n  - Ensure that the source and target connection points are not blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source. For example, the error in step 84 occurred because there were no valid connections between the boiler and steam engine.\n* Errors when using invalid EntityGroup\n  - Ensure that the EntityGroup is valid before attempting to use it. For example, the error in step 93 occurred because ElectricityGroup is not a valid EntityGroup.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nThe following variables have been assigned:\n- `stone`: count of stone resources (type: int)\n- `stone-brick`: count of stone-brick resources (type: int)\n\nThe following function has been defined:\n- `get_entities(entities: List[Prototype]) -> List[Entity]`: Returns a list of entities on the map that match the given prototype. \n  - Failure mode: IndexError when the list is empty.\n  - Success mode: Returns a list of entities when the list is not empty.\n- `get_entity(prototype: Prototype, position: Position) -> Entity`: Returns an entity on the map that matches the given prototype and position.\n  - Failure mode: Exception when the entity does not exist at the specified position. For example, the error in step 90 occurred because there was no Steam Engine at the specified"}
