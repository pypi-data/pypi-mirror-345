Consolidate on a unified, validated fluid_system identifier to ensure candidate pipe groups are consistently recognized.\n\n\u2022 Repeated Unsuccessful Candidate Searches:\n  - Multiple successive searches within a 15-tile radius returned 0 candidate pipe groups. Integrate a pre-check for candidate availability before initiating connection attempts to avoid redundant operations.\n\n\u2022 Expected Candidate Not Found:\n  - Even when using an expected working candidate (fluid_system 157497), no matching pipe group was found. Verify that the candidate\u2019s configuration, spatial parameters, and fluid system alignment are accurate prior to connection execution."}
