{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Ore Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) that moves items into the Stone Furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storage\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Coal Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) that moves items into a Wooden Chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -77.5) for storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Frequent Lack of Ingredients in Stone Furnace\n- Ensure a consistent supply of iron ore to the Stone Furnace to maintain continuous operation. Consider automating the supply chain to prevent frequent manual intervention.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Frequent Lack of Fuel in Mining Drills\n- Regularly check and replenish the fuel in mining drills to maintain their operational status. Automate fuel supply if possible.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int, current inventory count is 20\n- `iron-ore`: int, current inventory count is 2\n- `iron-plate`: int, current inventory count is 12"}
