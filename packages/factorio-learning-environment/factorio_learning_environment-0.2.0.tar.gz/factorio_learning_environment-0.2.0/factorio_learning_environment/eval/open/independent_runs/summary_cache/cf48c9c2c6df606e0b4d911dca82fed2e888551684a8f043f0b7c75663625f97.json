{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- A stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no fuel or ingredients to smelt, indicating it is inactive.\n\n### Lab Structure\nConsists of:\n- A lab with input of 10 automation-science-packs, currently with no power and engaged in automation research.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Sub-Ingredients\n- Ensure you have all necessary sub-ingredients before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates are required for crafting iron gear wheels and electronic circuits, and cannot be crafted without a furnace or crafting machine.\n\n### Errors When Extracting from Non-Existent Entities\n- Verify the existence of the target entity before attempting to extract items. For instance, ensure a valid stone furnace is present and contains the desired item before extraction.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Lack of Crafting Machines\n- Remember that certain items like iron plates require a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace. Ensure these machines are available and operational.\n\n### Errors in Locating Entities\n- Confirm the presence of entities such as steam engines on the map before attempting to locate or interact with them. This will prevent errors related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Insufficient Resources\n- Gather or craft all missing resources before proceeding with crafting complex items like labs. This includes ensuring adequate quantities of sub-components like iron gear wheels and electronic circuits."}
