{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Connected via pipe network (positions omitted for brevity)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Lab with no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity contains the item you wish to extract. For example, attempting to extract copper plates from a furnace that does not contain them will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Verify that the item you are trying to insert is available in your inventory. Attempting to insert copper ore when none is available will cause an error.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-consuming entities, such as boilers and burner mining drills, have sufficient fuel to operate. Lack of fuel will halt operations.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters, are connected to a power network to function correctly. Lack of power will prevent them from operating."}
