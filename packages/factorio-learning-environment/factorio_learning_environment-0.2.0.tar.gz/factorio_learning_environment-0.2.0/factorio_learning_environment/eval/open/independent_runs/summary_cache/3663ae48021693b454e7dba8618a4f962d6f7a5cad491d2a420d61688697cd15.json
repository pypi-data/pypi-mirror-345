{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has attempted to place various entities, but none have been successfully placed due to errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position is buildable before attempting to place any entity. This includes checking for obstacles, terrain suitability, and other environmental factors that might prevent placement.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities in occupied tiles\n- Verify that the tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. This includes ensuring there are no existing entities or environmental restrictions at the target location.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for entity operation\n- Before placing entities that require resources to function (e.g., furnaces needing coal), ensure that you have the necessary resources available and accessible for the entity to operate correctly.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure they are within the permissible build area. Avoid placing entities at extreme or invalid coordinates that might be outside the map or in restricted zones.\n\n### Inventory management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the required items for construction and operation of entities. Keep track of your resources to avoid running out during critical operations."}
