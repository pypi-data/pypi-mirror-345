{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with coal as fuel and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) which is currently empty.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) that processes copper plates.\n- Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) that stores copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when crafting items without the necessary machines**\n  - Ensure that you have the required crafting machine or furnace available before attempting to craft items. In this case, copper plates cannot be crafted without a furnace.\n  \n- **Errors when inserting items into entities that cannot accept them**\n  - Make sure the target entity (like a furnace) is capable of accepting the item you are trying to insert. If the furnace is full or has no ingredients, it cannot accept more items.\n  \n- **Errors when extracting items from a furnace that has no ingredients**\n  - Check the furnace status before attempting to extract items. If the furnace has no ingredients, it will not produce any output.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `craft_item(item_type: Prototype, quantity: int) -> None`\n    - Failure: Cannot craft items without the required machine.\n  \n  - `insert_item(item_type: Prototype, target_entity: Entity, quantity: int) -> None`\n    - Failure: Cannot insert items into entities that cannot accept them.\n  \n  - `extract_item(item_type: Prototype, source_entity: Entity, quantity: int) -> None`\n    - Success: Successfully extracts items from the furnace if it has items to extract.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `furnace_inventory: Inventory` - Represents the current inventory of the furnace.\n  - `final_inventory: Inventory` - Represents the player's final inventory after actions.\n  - `chest_inventory: Inventory` - Represents the current inventory of the chest."}
