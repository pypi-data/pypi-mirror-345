{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler with coal fuel at (-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups carrying water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting power to machines\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at (8.5, 13.5)\n- Input system for iron gears:\n  - Wooden chest at (7.5, 10.5) containing iron gears\n  - Burner inserter at (8.5, 10.5)\n- Input system for copper plates:\n  - Wooden chest at (8.5, 7.5) containing copper plates\n  - Burner inserter at (8.5, 8.5)\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter at (10.5, 13.5)\n  - Wooden chest at (11.5, 13.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining/smelting setups at different locations:\n1. Setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n2. Setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\n3. Setup at (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a position\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and direction\n- Consider alternative directions or increased spacing when initial placement fails\n- Verify the target area is suitable (not water or blocked by other entities)\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure fuel is available for burner-type entities\n- Keep track of input materials needed for assembling machines\n- Monitor chest inventories to maintain proper material flow\n\n### Space Management\n- Place appropriate sink objects at output positions when inserters are blocked\n- Ensure proper clearance around assembling machines and furnaces\n- Consider the full dimensions of larger entities (like assembling machines) when planning layouts\n\n### Power System\n- Maintain fuel levels in boilers\n- Ensure proper connection of power poles to all electrical entities\n- Monitor steam and water flow in the power generation system"}
