{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures built on the map. The logs indicate that the agent attempted to place various entities, but none were successfully placed. The map remains devoid of any constructed entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is buildable before attempting to place an entity. Verify that the area is clear and suitable for construction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without available resources\n- Verify that the necessary resources are available and that the entity is correctly placed to receive resources. For example, ensure coal is available and supplied to a furnace if one is placed.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on occupied tiles\n- Check that the tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Attempting to place an entity on a tile that is already occupied will result in failure.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the agent\n- Move closer to the intended placement location to ensure that the entity can be placed successfully. Being too far from the target area can prevent successful placement.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Double-check the environmental settings and ensure that the game environment is responsive and correctly initialized to avoid placement errors."}
