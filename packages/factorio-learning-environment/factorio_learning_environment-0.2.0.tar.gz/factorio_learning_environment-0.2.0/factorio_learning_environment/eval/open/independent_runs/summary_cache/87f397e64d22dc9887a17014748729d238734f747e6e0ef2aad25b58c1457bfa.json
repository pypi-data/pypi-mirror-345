{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The execution logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully placed. The map remains empty of any constructed structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place a Wooden Chest**: Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placing a wooden chest. Attempted placements at positions such as x=40.5 y=-82.5, x=50.0 y=-90.0, x=0.0 y=0.0, and x=100.0 y=-150.0 were unsuccessful.\n- **Cannot place a Transport Belt**: Verify that the tile is clear and appropriate for a transport belt before placing. Unsuccessful placements were attempted at x=45.0 y=-85.0 and x=65.0 y=-105.0.\n- **Cannot place a Stone Furnace**: Check that the location is suitable for a stone furnace. An attempt to place at x=5.0 y=5.0 failed.\n- **Cannot place a Burner Inserter**: Ensure the tile is appropriate for a burner inserter. An attempt to place at x=-50.0 y=50.0 was unsuccessful.\n\n### General Tips\n- Before placing any entity, confirm that the tile is not occupied by another entity or obstructed by terrain features.\n- Consider the proximity to resources and other structures when placing entities to optimize the layout and efficiency of your base."}
