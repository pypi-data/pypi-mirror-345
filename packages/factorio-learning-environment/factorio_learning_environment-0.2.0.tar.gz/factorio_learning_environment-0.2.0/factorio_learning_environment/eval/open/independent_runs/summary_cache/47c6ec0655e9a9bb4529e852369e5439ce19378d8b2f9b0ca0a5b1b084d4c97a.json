Regularly check your coal reserves and replenish them as needed.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests connected to production lines. Empty the chests regularly to prevent production halts due to full storage.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly check and supply the required raw materials to maintain continuous production."}
