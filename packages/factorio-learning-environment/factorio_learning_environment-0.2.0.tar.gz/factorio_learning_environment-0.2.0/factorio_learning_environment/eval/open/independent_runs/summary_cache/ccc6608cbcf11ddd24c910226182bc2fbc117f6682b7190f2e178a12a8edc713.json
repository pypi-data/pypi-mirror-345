{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (38.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (38.0, -83.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest (39.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n- Burner inserter (40.5, -83.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt system connecting to furnaces\n\n### Iron Ore Mining System at (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest (-13.5, -50.5) for ore storage\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - One at (-14.5, -51.5) for fuel management\n  - One at (-12.5, -50.5) moving ore to belt system\n- Transport belt connection to smelting area\n\n### Iron Smelting System\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\n- Storage chests:\n  - Two chests at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) containing iron plates\n  - Coal storage chest at (49.5, -80.5)\n  - Mixed storage at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Belt system:\n  - Main belt line at y=-81.5 from x=44.5 to x=47.5\n  - Two belt groups:\n    - One connecting mining to smelting (255 belts)\n    - One auxiliary group (5 belts)\n\n### Output Collection System\n- Burner inserter (40.5, -86.5) moving items to wooden chest (41.5, -86.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always check and clear existing entities before placing new ones\n- Common error with burner inserters at (45.0, -81.0) and (45.0, -80.5)\n- Remove blocking objects before attempting placement\n\n2. Belt System Issues\n- Clear blocked belts before modifications\n- Ensure transport belts are in inventory before placement attempts\n- Verify belt connections and flow direction when rebuilding\n\n3. Resource Management\n- Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow\n- Keep track of inventory resources before crafting/placing\n\n4. System Blockages\n- Regular monitoring of belt blockages needed\n- Clear jammed belts to maintain system flow\n- Check warning messages on inserters for blocked outputs\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  Success: When target location is clear\n  Failure: When location is blocked or missing resources\n\nImportant Variables:\n- input_inserter1: BurnerInserter\n- belt1: TransportBelt\n- Current inventory: Dict[str, int]\n- Entity positions: Position(x: float, y: float)"}
