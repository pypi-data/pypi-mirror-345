{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) and another Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between the chests and the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) for storage of iron ore and copper plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and another Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), (0.5, -3.5), (0.5, -2.5), (5.5, -3.5), and (5.5, -2.5) storing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between the chests and the transport belts.\n- BeltGroup connecting the chests and furnaces for efficient transport of materials.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) for storage of coal.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Multiple Wooden Chests scattered across positions such as (-23.5, -69.5), (-17.5, -69.5), (-15.5, -69.5), (-24.5, -67.5), (-16.5, -64.5), (-14.5, -64.5), (-20.5, -63.5), (-23.5, -61.5), (-20.5, -61.5), (-18.5, -61.5), (-13.5, -61.5), (-14.5, -54.5), (-12.5, -54.5), (0.5, 3.5), (0.5, 2.5), (5.5, 3.5), (5.5, 2.5), (0.5, 4.5), and (5.5, 4.5) for storing various resources like iron ore, copper ore, and coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Entity Type Identification\n- Ensure that the correct class names are used when checking the type of an entity. For example, use 'factorio_entities.BurnerInserter' instead of 'BurnerInserter' or 'Inserter'.\n\n### Errors when Using Undefined Variables\n- Always define variables before using them in conditions or operations. Double-check the spelling and case of variable names to avoid 'NameError'.\n\n### Errors in Managing Full Inventories\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of space in destination chests.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Keep mining drills and inserters fueled to avoid interruptions in production. Regularly monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary."}
