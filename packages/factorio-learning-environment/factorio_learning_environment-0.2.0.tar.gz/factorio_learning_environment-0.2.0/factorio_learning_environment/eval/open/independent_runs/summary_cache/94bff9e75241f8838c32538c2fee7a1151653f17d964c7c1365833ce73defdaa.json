{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-11.5, -3.5) - Newly placed but unconnected\n- **Boiler** at (-8.5, 0.0) - Connected to pump via underground pipes but still not operational (no fluid flow)\n- **Pipe Network**:\n  - Underground pipes connecting pump to boiler (system 14455/14457)\n  - Status: EMPTY (fluid not flowing)\n\n### New Power Plant (Added)\n- **Boiler** at (35.5, 47.0) - Fueled with coal but no water input\n- **Steam Engine** at (38.5, 46.5) - Connected to boiler but not operational\n- **Pipe Network**:\n  - Pipes connecting boiler to steam engine (system 14475)\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Unchanged)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Unpowered\n- **Oil Refinery** at (24.5, 44.5) - Unpowered\n- **Chemical Plant** at (31.5, 46.5) - Now powered but missing input resources\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Unchanged)\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at (34.5, 20.5) - Unpowered\n- **Transport Belt System** moving coal (status: WORKING)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Construction (Updated)\n- Offshore pump placement failures (-9.5,-1.5) - Verify water source exists before placement\n- Steam engine placement collisions (-5.5,0.0) - Clear target area completely before placement\n- Pipe connection failures (-9.5,-0.5) - Implement proper clearance checks for pipe routes\n- Fluid system validation needed - Check all connection points are unobstructed\n\n### Inventory Management (New)\n- Solar panel placement failure (30.5,45.5) - Verify inventory before placement attempts\n- Offshore pump placement failure (34.5,45.5) - Track entity counts in inventory\n\n### Construction Sequence (Updated)\n1. Verify water source availability\n2. Check inventory for required entities\n3. Clear target placement area\n4. Validate all connection points\n5. Confirm fluid system integrity after placement\n\n### Entity Persistence (New)\n- Chemical plant retrieval failure (31.5,46.5) - Implement entity existence verification\n- Steam engine retrieval failure (-5.5,0.0) - Add error handling for missing entities\n\n### Best Practices (Updated)\n- Always verify inventory before placement operations\n- Implement complete clearance checks for pipe routes\n- Add validation for entity persistence after placement\n- Verify all connection points are unobstructed\n- Check fluid system integrity after construction"}
