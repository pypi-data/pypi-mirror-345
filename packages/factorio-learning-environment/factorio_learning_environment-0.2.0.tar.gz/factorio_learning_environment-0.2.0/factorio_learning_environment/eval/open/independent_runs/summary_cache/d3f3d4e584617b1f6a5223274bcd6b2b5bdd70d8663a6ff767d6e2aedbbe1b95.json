{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0)**: Fueled with coal, currently contains 19 iron plates, but has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0)**: Fueled with coal, currently contains 19 iron plates, but has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5)**: Contains coal.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5)**: Contains coal.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5)**: Contains coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)**: Fueled with coal, actively mining coal and transferring it.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5)**: Fueled with coal, waiting for source items, positioned to transfer items from the mining drill to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5)**: Contains coal.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5)**: Currently empty, refilled periodically.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., mining drill or chest) has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be achieved by checking the inventory of the source entity and ensuring it is not empty.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly supply the furnaces with the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to maintain continuous production. This can be done by setting up a reliable supply chain or manually inserting the ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities present on the map, including their positions, statuses, and inventories."}
