{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) connected to pipe at (-8.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 3.5) with fuel inventory (43 coal)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 3.5) producing 13500.0 kW\n- Connected pipe network from (-8.5, -0.5) to (-5.5, 3.5)\n- Power network with poles including at (0.5, 6.5) and (-2.5, 5.5)\n\n### Oil Extraction and Storage System at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) working at 100% efficiency\n- Storage tanks at:\n  - (22.5, 40.5) containing 29.08 crude oil\n  - (27.5, 40.5) containing 10.66 crude oil \n  - (32.5, 40.5) containing 3.50 crude oil\n  - (37.5, 40.5) - newly added\n  - (42.5, 40.5) - newly added\n- Connected pipe network spanning from (18.5, 38.5) to (30.5, 41.5)\n- Power network with poles including at (15.5, 39.5) and (32.5, 45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Prototype reference errors\n- When referencing entity dimensions, use correct prototype names (occurred when trying to access Prototype.Pumpjack instead of Prototype.PumpJack)\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Verify inventory contains required items before placement (occurred when trying to place steel-chest without having one)\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones (occurred when placing wooden-chest at occupied position (32.5, 45.5))\n\n### Fluid system monitoring\n- Avoid accessing stale entity data when checking fluid boxes (occurred when checking offshore pump status)\n- Ensure proper fluid measurement methods are used (storage tanks don't have 'contents' attribute)\n\n### Power network considerations\n- When extending power networks, ensure sufficient pole spacing and clear paths\n- Verify power connections after placement to confirm operational status\n\n### Factory maintenance\n- Monitor boiler fuel levels regularly (current: 43 coal remaining)\n- Check pipe connections periodically for optimal fluid flow\n- Expand storage when tanks reach 80% capacity\n\n### API usage\n- The nearest() function doesn't accept 'position' keyword argument - check correct parameter usage\n- Storage tanks don't have 'contents' attribute - use appropriate fluid measurement methods"}
