{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Ore Mining Section**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) extracting iron ore.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) waiting to transfer items.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5) for storing output.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Coal Extraction Section**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) waiting to transfer items.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-77.5) for storing output.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) has the necessary ingredients to operate. Regularly check the supply chain to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- The Burner Mining Drills at positions (x=52.0, y=-82.0) and (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) have warnings about output being blocked. Ensure there is a sink entity or storage available to accept the output from these drills to prevent operational halts.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- The Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) and another at (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) are waiting for source items. Verify that the supply chain is not disrupted and that the source items are available for pickup.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int, current inventory count is 70.\n- `iron-plate`: int, current inventory count is 212."}
