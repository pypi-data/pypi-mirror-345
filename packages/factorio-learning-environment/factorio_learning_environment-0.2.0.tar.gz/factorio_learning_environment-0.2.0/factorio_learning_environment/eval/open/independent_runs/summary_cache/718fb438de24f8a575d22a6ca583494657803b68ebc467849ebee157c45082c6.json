Verify the presence of coal in the target entity.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Before attempting to refuel entities like boilers or mining drills, confirm that the coal is available in the inventory or storage chests. Ensure the correct entity is targeted for refueling.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Verify that all power-generating entities are properly connected to the power network. Ensure that steam engines have a fluid connection and are linked to the power grid with electric poles.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests and other storage entities to prevent overfilling, which can halt production processes."}
