{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) for extracting resources, connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted resources.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) for transferring resources from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) for moving iron ore from the chest to the furnaces.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) for moving iron plates from the furnace to the storage chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing produced iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination storage for the inserter is not full. Regularly transfer items from the destination to prevent blockage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source for the inserter has items available for transfer. Regularly supply the source with necessary items to maintain a steady flow.\n\n### Errors when Attempting to Insert Items with Insufficient Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, verify that you have the required items in your inventory."}
