{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not operational due to lack of fuel and ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (chest) to the destination (furnace). Frequent repositioning indicates misalignment.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace has both fuel and ingredients (iron ore) to function. Ensure the inserter is correctly set up to supply the furnace with iron ore.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can stop the mining drill from depositing more iron ore. Regularly extract items to free up space.\n\n### Errors when Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup and ensure it is operational and correctly transferring iron ore to the furnace. Frequent checks indicate persistent issues with the setup.\n\n### Errors with Resource Availability\n- Maintain sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel entities as needed. Running out of coal can disrupt operations."}
