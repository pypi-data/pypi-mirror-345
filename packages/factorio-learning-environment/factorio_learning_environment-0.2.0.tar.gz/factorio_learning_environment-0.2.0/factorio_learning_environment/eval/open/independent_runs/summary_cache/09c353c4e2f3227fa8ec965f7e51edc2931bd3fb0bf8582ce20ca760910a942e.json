Multiple attempts to craft or place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) did not succeed, leaving the research support structure unavailable. Although the logs refer to smelting operations using a furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0), these are only referenced for resource processing and are not newly created building structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Errors for Entity Retrieval\n  - Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) and ensure that the parameters passed match the defined function signature for get_entities.\n  - Confirm whether the API expects positional parameters or a specific mapping, so that calls do not result in \u201c0 positional arguments but 3 were given.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Error Handling for Null Entity Returns\n  - Before iterating over results (such as labs), verify that the returned value is not None. Default to an empty list if no entities are found to prevent \u201c\u2018NoneType\u2019 object is not iterable\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Failures\n  - Ensure that all sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) are sufficiently available and that any required processing (smelting or crafting intermediate components) is completed before initiating Lab production.\n  - Confirm that the lab exists in inventory before attempting placement to avoid errors like \u201cCould not place lab \u2026 No lab in inventory.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Fallback Mechanism Improvements\n  - When a fallback is used (for example, converting a None result to an empty list), implement robust checks to ensure that subsequent operations can safely proceed without relying on missing entities."}
