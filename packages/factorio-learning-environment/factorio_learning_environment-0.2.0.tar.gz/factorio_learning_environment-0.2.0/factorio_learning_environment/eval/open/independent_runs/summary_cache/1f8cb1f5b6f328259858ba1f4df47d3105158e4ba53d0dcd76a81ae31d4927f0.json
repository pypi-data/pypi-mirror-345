{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new persistent structures have been successfully created by the agent so far. Multiple attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) (whose intended use is to receive Automation Science Packs for research) failed because the required Lab item was not in inventory and due to subsequent resource shortages. \n\u2022 Pre\u2010existing smelting units were used during recovery updates. For example, an alternative furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) was employed to increase the iron-plate count, and a copper furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) was used for copper plate production. These machines were retrieved from the map rather than constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities Usage Errors\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, adhere strictly to its defined signature. Passing unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. \"radius\") or using extra positional parameters leads to type errors. Verify the expected parameters before invoking this API.\n\u2022 Entity Retrieval and Iteration Failures\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the result of get_entities is not None before iteration. Check returned values to avoid TypeError when attempting to iterate over a NoneType.\n\u2022 Lab Placement Errors\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the Lab item is available in the inventory prior to attempting its placement. Conduct an inventory check to prevent placement failures.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that all prerequisite sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available in sufficient quantities before initiating Lab crafting. Establish a production plan for these intermediate products so that crafting attempts do not fail due to missing resources.\n\u2022 Fallback Strategy Considerations\n\u2003\u2013 When employing fallback approaches (for example, reattempting to craft a Lab if entity retrieval returns None), ensure that both the inventory and production requirements are met. Consistently update resource counts to eliminate repeated crafting or placement errors."}
