{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with connections to multiple pipes, currently out of fuel.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with connections to pipes, currently not connected due to no input liquid.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) supplying water, connected to pipes.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Pipe Group** for water transport, starting from offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and extending through various positions.\n- **Pipe Group** for steam transport, starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) and extending through various positions.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at various positions, including (x=3.5, y=20.5) and (x=14.5, y=20.5), currently with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Entity Class\n- Ensure all classes and entities used in code are defined or imported correctly. For example, the `AssemblingMachine` class was not defined, leading to a `NameError`.\n\n### Connection Failures\n- When connecting entities like boilers to steam engines, ensure that all necessary components (e.g., pipes) are correctly placed and connected to avoid failures.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Always check inventory for the required fuel before attempting to refuel entities like boilers to prevent exceptions due to lack of resources.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `powered_entities`: List intended to store entities like `AssemblingMachine`, `Lab`, and `ElectricMiningDrill`, but faced a `NameError` due to undefined class.\n- Inventory variables such as `wooden-chest`, `burner-inserter`, `small-electric-pole`, and others with their respective quantities are maintained in the agent's inventory."}
