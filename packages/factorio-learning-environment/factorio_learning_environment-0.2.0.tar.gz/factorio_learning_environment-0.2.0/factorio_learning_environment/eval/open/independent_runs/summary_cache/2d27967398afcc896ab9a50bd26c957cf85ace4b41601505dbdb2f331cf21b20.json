{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at position (2.0, -63.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (2.0, -63.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it at position (2.5, -61.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, -61.5): Collects iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, -61.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (4.0, -63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates. Currently out of fuel and has a full furnace source.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (6.0, -63.0): Secondary furnace with no ingredients to smelt and low fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -61.5): Stores iron ore transferred by the inserter.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has produced the required item (e.g., iron plates) before attempting to extract. The furnace at (4.0, -63.0) was empty when extraction was attempted.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has space in its source inventory before inserting items. The furnace at (4.0, -63.0) was full, causing insertion failures.\n\n#### Errors with fuel management\n- Ensure furnaces and mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. The furnace at (4.0, -63.0) is out of fuel, and the burner inserter is waiting for source items due to insufficient fuel.\n\n#### Errors with inserter operations\n- Ensure the inserter has a valid source and destination. The burner inserter at (3.5, -61.5) is waiting for source items and has a full chest at its drop position.\n\n#### General tips\n- Regularly check the status of entities (e.g., fuel levels, inventory space) to avoid operational errors.\n- Address warnings such as \"out of fuel,\" \"furnace source is full,\" and \"no ingredients to smelt\" promptly to maintain production efficiency."}
