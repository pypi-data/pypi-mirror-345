{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=1.0, y=1.0) and (x=3.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=3.0, y=1.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=4.5, y=1.5) that picks up from the furnace at (x=3.0, y=1.0) and drops at position (x=5.5, y=1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=6.5, y=1.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) and Belt at (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), outputs to Belt at (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5)\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), outputs to Belt at (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inserter Operation\n- Ensure that the burner inserter is correctly positioned and fueled to prevent it from waiting for source items. Regularly check the inserter's status and warnings to address any issues promptly.\n\n### Errors Due to Blockages\n- Regularly inspect the production line for any blockages and clear them to maintain a smooth flow of materials. This will prevent interruptions in production and ensure efficient operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure furnaces are consistently refueled and supplied with raw materials to avoid warnings such as 'out of fuel' or 'no ingredients to smelt'. Regular checks will help maintain continuous production."}
