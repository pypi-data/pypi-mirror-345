{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Storage and Processing at x=-13.5 y=-51.5\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at x=-13.5 y=-51.5 for iron ore storage\n- Furnace at x=-15.0 y=-51.0 for smelting iron ore\n- Furnace at x=-13.0 y=-50.0 for smelting iron ore\n\n#### Coal Storage at x=41.5 y=-80.5 and x=43.5 y=-80.5\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at x=41.5 y=-80.5 for coal storage\n- Wooden chest at x=43.5 y=-80.5 for coal storage\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting into a full inventory\n- Ensure the target inventory has space before attempting to insert items. For example, the wooden chest at x=-13.5 y=-51.5 was full when attempting to insert iron ore.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert without having the item in inventory\n- Verify that the required item is in your inventory before attempting to insert it. Multiple attempts to insert iron ore failed because the agent did not have any in its inventory.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use inserters to transfer items from chests to belts. Attempting to connect belts directly to wooden chests at x=41.5 y=-80.5 and x=43.5 y=-80.5 resulted in an error.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(Position, Position, Prototype)`: Attempts to connect entities with belts. Failed when trying to connect a chest directly to a belt.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `furnace_1`: Represents a furnace entity, likely used for smelting iron ore.\n- `new_chest_position_1`: Represents the position of a newly placed wooden chest at x=41.5 y=-80.5.\n- `belts`: Represents transport belts, used for connecting entities."}
