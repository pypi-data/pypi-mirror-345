{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill (x=41.0, y=-86.0)**: Out of fuel, waiting for coal.\n- **Burner Mining Drill (x=43.0, y=-86.0)**: Active, mining coal. Connected to a wooden chest at (x=43.5, y=-84.5).\n- **Wooden Chest (x=43.5, y=-84.5)**: Collecting coal from the mining drill. Currently full with 124 coal.\n- **Burner Inserter (x=41.5, y=-83.5)**: Transfers coal from the belt to a wooden chest at (x=41.5, y=-82.5).\n- **Wooden Chest (x=41.5, y=-82.5)**: Collecting coal from the inserter. Contains 727 coal.\n\n#### Smelting Setup at Position (x=43.0, y=-79.0)\n- **Stone Furnace (x=43.0, y=-79.0)**: No ingredients to smelt. Fueled with 10 coal.\n- **Burner Inserter (x=43.5, y=-80.5)**: Waiting for iron ore to feed into the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter (x=44.5, y=-78.5)**: Waiting for items to transfer from the furnace to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest (x=43.5, y=-76.5)**: Empty, intended to collect smelted items.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at Position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n- **Stone Furnace (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)**: No ingredients to smelt. Fueled with 10 coal.\n- **Burner Inserter (x=-16.5, y=-50.5)**: Waiting for iron ore to feed into the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter (x=-14.5, y=-52.5)**: Waiting to extract smelted iron plates from the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest (x=-13.5, y=-51.5)**: Empty, intended to collect smelted iron plates.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)**: No ingredients to smelt. Fueled with 12 coal.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors Related to Missing Inventory Items\n- **Missing burner mining drill**: Ensure you have the required materials (iron plates) to craft a burner mining drill before attempting to place it.\n- **Missing stone furnace**: Gather stone from resource patches before attempting to craft a stone furnace.\n- **Missing wooden chest**: Gather wood from trees before attempting to craft a wooden chest.\n\n#### Errors Related to Placement\n- **Placing entities too far away**: Move closer to the target position before placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n- **Occupied tiles**: Ensure the target tile is free of obstacles (e.g., water, other entities) before placing an entity.\n- **Incorrect inserter placement**: When placing inserters, ensure the spacing and direction do not conflict with existing entities. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary.\n\n#### Errors Related to Smelting and Mining\n- **No ingredients to smelt**: Ensure the furnace has both fuel (coal) and the required raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to start smelting.\n- **Mining drill out of fuel**: Regularly check and refuel mining drills with coal to keep them operational.\n- **Chest full**: Empty chests connected to mining drills to allow continuous mining.\n\n#### Errors Related to Crafting\n- **Crafting without a crafting machine**: Use a crafting machine (e.g., assembling machine) or furnace to craft items that require sub-ingredients (e.g., iron plates).\n- **Missing raw resources**: Gather raw resources (e.g., stone, wood) before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n#### General Tips\n- **Plan ahead**: Ensure you have all required materials and resources before starting a new construction or crafting task.\n- **Check inventory**: Regularly monitor your inventory to avoid running out of essential items.\n- **Clear obstacles**: Before placing entities, ensure the target area is free of obstacles or unplaceable terrain."}
