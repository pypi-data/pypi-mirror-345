{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) - no fuel\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) with 4 coal and 20 iron plates\nSystem not operational due to lack of fuel in drill\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting System at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) - no fuel\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) with 2 coal and 14 copper plates\nSystem not operational due to lack of fuel in drill\n\n### Power Generation System at (-14.5, 19.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) - working and producing water\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) - has coal but no water input\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 12.5) - not properly connected\n- Multiple disconnected pipe groups scattered across the map\nSystem not operational due to connection issues\n\n### Research Lab System\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs (10)\nCurrently not operational due to no power\n\n### Unused Smelting Area\nGroup of 4 unused furnaces at:\n- (0.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 4.0)\n- (4.0, 4.0)\nAll have fuel (23 coal each) but no ingredients\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nElectric pole network (Group ID 4752) connecting various areas but currently not operational (0 voltage)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Place steam engine directly adjacent to boiler's steam output point (-14.5, 17.0)\n- Ensure steam engine is placed with correct orientation (facing UP)\n- Remove all existing pipe groups before attempting new connections\n- Create direct connections without intermediate pipes\n\n### Entity Placement Spacing\n- Verify target location is clear of other entities before placement\n- Consider the full dimensions of steam engine (3x5 tiles) when planning placement\n- Leave appropriate spacing between boiler and steam engine for connections\n\n### Distance Management\n- Move closer to target location before placing entities\n- Stay within 10 tiles of placement location\n- Position player between connection points when creating pipe networks\n\n### Pipe System Issues\n- Remove all existing pipe groups before creating new connections\n- Create single, direct connections rather than complex networks\n- Ensure connection points are not blocked by other entities\n- Verify fluid flow direction when connecting entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Maintain fuel levels in production entities\n- Current inventory shows excessive pipes (2156) while lacking other resources\n- Consider crafting essential items instead of accumulating basic materials\n\n### Power System Setup\n- Complete power generation setup in this order:\n  1. Place boiler\n  2. Place steam engine in correct position and orientation\n  3. Create water connection from pump to boiler\n  4. Create steam connection from boiler to engine\n- Verify all connections before adding more components"}
