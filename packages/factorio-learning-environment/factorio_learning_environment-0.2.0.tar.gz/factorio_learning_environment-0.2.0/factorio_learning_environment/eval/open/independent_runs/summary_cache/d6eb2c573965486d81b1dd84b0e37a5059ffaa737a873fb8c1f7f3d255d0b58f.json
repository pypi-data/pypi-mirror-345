{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities for fluid transfer\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with a fuel inventory of coal\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with a fuel inventory of coal\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a fuel inventory of coal\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for item transfer\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-50.5, -122.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-47.5, -122.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT\n- Multiple other PipeGroups with status EMPTY, indicating potential for future fluid connections\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles spanning positions from (3.5, -57.5) to (11.5, 21.5), currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure that the position where you intend to place a pipe is valid and that the pipe entity is available in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to both the boiler and the power network. Ensure that the boiler is receiving water and fuel to generate steam.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check that the inserter is within the range of an active power pole and that the electricity network is operational. Ensure that the power network is connected to a power source that is generating electricity."}
