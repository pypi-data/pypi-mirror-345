{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), extracting iron ore and transferring it to:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), intended to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), which is currently not receiving iron ore for smelting.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid placement issues.\n\n### Errors with inserter setup\n- Verify the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring items effectively.\n\n### Furnace not receiving ingredients\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly configured to transfer items to the furnace. Make sure the inserter is powered and has a clear path to move items from the chest to the furnace."}
