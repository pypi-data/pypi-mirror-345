{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components, including PipeGroups at positions (x=-0.5, y=11.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5), and (x=-6.5, y=25.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnaces at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=10.0, y=0.0), (x=13.0, y=0.0), and (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5) for transferring items between entities\n\n### Lab Facility\n- Lab at position (x=1.5, y=14.5) with input for automation science packs, currently not conducting research\n\n### Electrical Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), and (x=3.5, y=20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Undefined Variables\n- Ensure that all variables and entities are correctly defined and imported before use. For example, use `entities.Furnace` and `entities.Lab` instead of undefined `Furnace` and `Lab`.\n\n### Errors When Attempting to Locate Non-Existent Entities\n- Verify the existence and correct positioning of entities like Labs before attempting to interact with them. Ensure the Lab is placed at the intended coordinates before using `get_entity`.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel or Ingredients\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to avoid status warnings like \"NO_INGREDIENTS\".\n\n### Errors When Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have a continuous supply of source items to prevent them from idling. Regularly supply the necessary materials to keep production lines active."}
