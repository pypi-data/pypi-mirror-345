{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipes at positions (-8.0, 24.5), (-7.0, 24.5), and (-6.0, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 26.0)\n- Steam engine at position (35.5, 27.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Burner inserters positioned to transfer items between chests and furnaces\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5), and (8.5, 1.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities across the map, ensuring fluid transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure that the target tile is free from obstructions before attempting to place a pipe. Clear any existing objects in the way.\n\n### Offshore Pump Connection Issues\n- Verify that the offshore pump is properly connected to the pipe network. Ensure that there are no breaks in the pipe connections leading from the pump.\n\n### Boiler Verification Failures\n- Confirm that the boiler is correctly connected to both the water source and the steam engine. Check for any missing or misplaced pipes.\n\n### Inserter Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Before inserting items into a furnace or other entities, ensure there is sufficient space in the target inventory to accommodate the items.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Insufficient Materials\n- Make sure you have all the necessary materials in your inventory before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Steam\n- Check the entire steam production chain from the offshore pump to the steam engine for any disconnections or blockages. Ensure all pipes are correctly placed and connected."}
