{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) that is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) which is supposed to smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position. Misalignment will prevent the inserter from transferring items effectively. Verify the coordinates of both the inserter and the chest to ensure they match.\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- When placing an inserter, ensure there is no collision with existing entities. If an error occurs, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid conflicts with nearby entities.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly positioned and fueled to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the inserter is operational and aligned correctly.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory Resources\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required resources are available in your inventory. If resources are insufficient, gather more before proceeding with the operation."}
