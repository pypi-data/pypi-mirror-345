{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Production Line at (-73.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron ore:\n- First stone furnace at position (3.0, -73.0)\n- Second stone furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational, containing coal as fuel and have iron plates as output. Each furnace currently has:\n- 23 coal units as fuel\n- 13 iron plates as output\nCurrently waiting for new ingredients to smelt\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (-21.0, -73.0) targeting copper ore deposit\n- Stone furnace at (-19.0, -74.0)\n- Iron chest at (-21.5, -74.5) to collect copper ore from drill\n- Burner inserter at (-20.5, -74.5) moving items from chest to furnace\nCurrent status:\n- Mining drill has 15 coal units as fuel\n- Furnace has 17 coal units as fuel and 25 copper plates\n- Inserter has 19 coal units as fuel\n- System is operational with proper material flow\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Raw Resource Gathering Issues\n- Remember that some items like wood cannot be crafted and must be gathered from the environment\n- Verify resource availability before attempting to craft items that require raw materials\n\n###Output Blockage Issues\n- Ensure there is a valid sink entity to accept output before starting operations\n- Clear any items blocking the ground where outputs need to be dropped\n- Verify the entire production chain has proper connections before starting operations\n- When setting up mining drill and inserter combinations, ensure the inserter's pickup position matches the drill's drop position\n- Fix misaligned inserter pickup/drop positions that don't match the production flow\n\n###Entity Reference Errors\n- Ensure the correct format when referencing entity positions (use Position objects where required)\n- Double check coordinate values when getting entity references\n- Use proper type annotations when working with lists or collections of entities\n\n###Resource Management Tips\n- Keep track of essential resources like coal in inventory\n- Plan ahead to ensure you have all necessary materials before starting new construction\n- When setting up mining operations, always ensure you have all required items in inventory before attempting to place them\n- Verify inventory contains required items before attempting placement\n\n###Inserter Placement and Rotation Issues\n- Verify the drop position of mining equipment before placing inserters\n- Ensure inserter's pickup position aligns with the mining drill's drop position\n- Double-check inserter rotation to ensure proper material flow direction\n- Ensure there is enough space between mining drill and furnace for inserter placement\n- Avoid placing multiple inserters at the same position coordinates\n\n###Operating Equipment without Fuel\n- Always insert fuel into new inserters immediately after placement\n- Keep coal in inventory for fueling new equipment\n- Check fuel levels of existing equipment regularly\n\n###Item Pickup Errors\n- Verify items are actually present at the pickup location before attempting to pick them up\n- Check if items are being blocked or consumed by other entities before attempting pickup\n- Ensure the pickup position matches exactly where items are being dropped\n\n###Alignment and Distance Issues\n- The distance between mining drill's drop position and furnace/inserter setup must be properly calculated\n- When cleaning up misaligned setups, ensure new placements are properly positioned relative to existing structures\n- Consider the entire production line layout before placing individual components"}
