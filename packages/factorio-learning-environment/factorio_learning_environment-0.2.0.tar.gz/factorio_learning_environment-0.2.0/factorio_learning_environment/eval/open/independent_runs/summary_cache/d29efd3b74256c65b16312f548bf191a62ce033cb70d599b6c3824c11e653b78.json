{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (40.0, -84.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -83.5) receiving items from the burner mining drill.\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring items from the wooden chest to another destination.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) transferring iron plates from the chest at position (56.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (56.5, -83.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt group connecting positions (50.5, -86.5) to (52.5, -83.5) for transporting coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output Blockage\n- Ensure that the output of the mining drill is not blocked by items on the ground. Regularly clear any items that may obstruct the output.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path and are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Check that the source and destination entities are correctly aligned with the inserter's pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended entity."}
