{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping due to lack of storage space. This will ensure continuous operation of your mining drills.\n\n### Errors when furnaces lack ingredients\n- Monitor the status of furnaces to ensure they have the necessary ingredients for smelting. Use inserters effectively to maintain a steady supply of raw materials to furnaces."}
