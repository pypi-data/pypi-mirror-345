{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. The agent made repeated attempts to deploy a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but none of these attempts resulted in an entity being placed. Although existing furnaces (an alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were referenced during smelting operations, no new structures have been built.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 When using get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Use only supported parameters. Avoid specifying unexpected keywords (for example, do not use a \u201cradius\u201d keyword) or extra positional arguments that conflict with the function\u2019s signature.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm the expected input format before calling the API to prevent type errors.\n\n\u2022 When processing entity collections:\n\u2003\u2013 Always check that the return value is iterable (i.e. not None) before attempting to iterate over it to avoid \"'NoneType' object is not iterable\" errors.\n\n\u2022 For Lab crafting and placement:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all prerequisite components (such as iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) are available and producible through appropriate smelting or crafting chains before initiating Lab production.\n\u2003\u2013 After crafting, verify that the Lab item is present in the inventory and that the target placement position is valid and unoccupied so placement can succeed."}
