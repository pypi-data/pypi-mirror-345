{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(1.7, 2.3)\nConsists of steam engine (position not specified), boiler (position not specified), and offshore pump (position not specified). This structure is responsible for generating electricity to power other entities on the map.\n\n### Lab at position(5.0, 5.0)\nThis structure is currently not powered and is set to research automation. It is connected to the Electricity Group at position(1.7, 2.3).\n\n### Copper plate furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position(0.0, 0.0)) that is currently full of fuel but has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron plate furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position(5.0, 5.0)) that is currently full of fuel but has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to Electricity Group\n- Ensure that the Electricity Group is properly initialized and that all entities connected to it have the necessary attributes. In this case, the error was due to attempting to access a non-existent attribute 'energy' on the ElectricityGroup object.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
