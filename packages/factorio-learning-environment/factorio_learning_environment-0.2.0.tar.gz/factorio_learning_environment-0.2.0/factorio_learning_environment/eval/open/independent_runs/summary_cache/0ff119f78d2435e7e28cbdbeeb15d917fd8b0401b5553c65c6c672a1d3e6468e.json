{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace Array at position(1, 1) and (3, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input, producing iron plates.\n- Stone furnace (position (3.0, 0.0)) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input, producing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace has enough capacity to accept the items before inserting. Check the status of the furnace to avoid overloading.\n\n### Errors when extracting from furnaces\n- Be aware of the furnace's output capacity. If the output is full, extraction will not succeed. Monitor the inventory of the furnace before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
