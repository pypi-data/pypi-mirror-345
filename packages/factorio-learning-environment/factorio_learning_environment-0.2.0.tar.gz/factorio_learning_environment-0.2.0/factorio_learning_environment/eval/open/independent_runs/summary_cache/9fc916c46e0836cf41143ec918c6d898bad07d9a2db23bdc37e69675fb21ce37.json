{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron ore mine at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of a BurnerMiningDrill at position(-15.0, -50.0), a Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5), a BurnerInserter at position(-15.5, -48.5), and a TransportBelt at position(-13.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -47.5)\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a StoneFurnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n\n### BeltGroup at position(-13.5, -49.5) to (-14.5, -45.5)\nConsists of multiple TransportBelts forming a BeltGroup with inputs at position(-13.5, -49.5) and outputs at position(-14.5, -45.5)\n\n### BeltGroup at position(-15.5, -45.5) to (-15.5, -48.5)\nConsists of multiple TransportBelts forming a BeltGroup with inputs at position(-15.5, -45.5) and outputs at position(-15.5, -48.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when mining with a full chest\n- Ensure the chest at the drop position is not full before continuing to mine. Empty the chest at the specified position to resolve the issue.\n\n### Errors when inserting items with no sink entity\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output before inserting items. This can be resolved by placing a chest or another entity that can accept the output near the inserter.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* No utility functions have been defined or invoked.\n* Important variables:\n  - `transport-belt`: int (number of transport belts in inventory)\n  - `burner-inserter`: int (number of burner inserters in inventory)\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: int (number of burner mining drills in inventory)\n  - `coal`: int (number of coal in inventory)\n  - `stone`: int (number of stone in inventory)\n  - `iron-ore`: int (number of iron ore in inventory)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (number of iron plates in inventory)"}
