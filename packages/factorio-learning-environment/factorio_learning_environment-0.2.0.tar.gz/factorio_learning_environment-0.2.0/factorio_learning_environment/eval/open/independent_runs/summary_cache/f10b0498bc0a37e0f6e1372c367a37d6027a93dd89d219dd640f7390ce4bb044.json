Check for terrain issues such as water.\n\n### Errors when trying to get entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to get exists at the specified position. If it does not, ensure that the position is correct and that the entity has been placed before attempting to access it.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
