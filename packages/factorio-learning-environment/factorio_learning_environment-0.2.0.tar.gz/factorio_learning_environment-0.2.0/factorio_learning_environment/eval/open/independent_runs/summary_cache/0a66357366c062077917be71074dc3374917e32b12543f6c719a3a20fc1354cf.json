{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) for smelting.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) transferring items to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Multiple BeltGroups for transporting materials between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by verifying the map data or using a check function to confirm the entity's presence.\n\n### Errors in Belt Placement\n- Make sure to move closer to the target position before placing a transport belt. The maximum allowable distance is 10 units, so plan your movements accordingly to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Non-Working Belts\n- Regularly check belts for blockages or misalignments to ensure they are functioning correctly. Replace or realign belts as necessary to maintain efficient transport of materials."}
