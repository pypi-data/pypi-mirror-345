{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 3.5)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 3.5)\n- Connected with pipes from (-8.5, -0.5) to (-5.5, 3.5)\n- Power network with poles including at (0.5, 6.5) and (-2.5, 5.5)\n\n### Oil Extraction System at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5)\n- Storage tanks at (22.5, 40.5) and (27.5, 40.5)\n- Connected with pipes from (18.5, 38.5) to (25.5, 40.5)\n- Power network with poles including at (15.5, 39.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones (occurred when placing small-electric-pole at (-0.5, 3.5))\n- Verify exact prototype names (occurred when trying to use 'Pumpjack' instead of correct 'PumpJack')\n\n### API usage errors\n- Storage tanks don't have 'contents' attribute - use appropriate fluid measurement methods\n- The nearest() function doesn't accept 'position' keyword argument - check correct parameter usage\n\n### Power network considerations\n- When extending power networks, ensure sufficient pole spacing and clear paths\n- Verify power connections after placement to confirm operational status\n\n### Fluid system management\n- Monitor fluid levels in storage tanks to prevent overflow/underflow\n- Ensure proper pipe connections between fluid-producing and fluid-consuming entities"}
