{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Mining and Processing Complex at (-10, -59)\nA large mining and processing facility consisting of:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (-10,-59), (-8,-59), and (-6,-59) mining iron ore\n- Transport belt system connecting the drills\n- Multiple wooden chests at (-9.5,-57.5), (-7.5,-57.5), (-5.5,-57.5) for ore storage\n- Burner inserters at (-6.5,-57.5), (-5.5,-56.5), (-4.5,-57.5) moving materials between components\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting at (-28, -61)\nA copper processing setup with:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28,-61)\n- Stone furnace at (-27,-59)\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5,-58.5)\n- Storage chest at (-24.5,-58.5) containing processed plates\n\n###Iron Plate Production Line (0,0)\nA smelting array consisting of:\n- 4 stone furnaces at positions (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), (6,0)\n- Input wooden chests at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), (6.5,2.5)\n- Burner inserters moving materials between chests and furnaces\n- Connected by transport belt systems\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if the target position is already occupied by another entity or item on ground before placing new entities\n- When placing chests near mining drills, ensure the drop position is clear of other entities\n\n### Output blocking errors\n- Ensure there is a proper output entity (chest/belt) placed at the drop position of mining drills and inserters\n- Clear any items blocking the output path before attempting to place new structures\n\n### Entity placement coordination\n- When building complex structures, plan the layout to avoid entity overlap\n- Place output collection entities (chests/belts) before starting resource extraction"}
