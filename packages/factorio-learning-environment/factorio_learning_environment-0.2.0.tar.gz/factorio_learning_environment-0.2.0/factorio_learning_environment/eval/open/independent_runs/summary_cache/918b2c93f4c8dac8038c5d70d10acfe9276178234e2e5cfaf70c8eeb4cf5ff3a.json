{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) to collect coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for collecting iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Processing at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure that the entity type and position are correct before attempting to retrieve an entity. The error \"No entity of type wooden-chest found at the specified position\" suggests checking the position and type of the entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Verify that the target position is clear of other objects before placing an entity. The error \"Could not place wooden-chest at (41.5, -80.5)\" indicates that there was an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors related to resource collection\n- Ensure that drills are correctly positioned and configured to output resources to the intended collection point. The logs indicate that both the iron and copper chests are not collecting ore, suggesting a need to verify the output configuration of the drills.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `get_entity`: Used to retrieve entities from the map. Ensure correct entity type and position are specified.\n  - `place_entity`: Used to place entities on the map. Ensure the target position is available and not obstructed.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `copper_chest`: Represents a wooden chest intended for copper collection. Type: `Entity`\n  - `iron_chest`: Represents a wooden chest intended for iron collection. Type: `Entity`"}
