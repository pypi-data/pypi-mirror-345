{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with a fuel inventory containing coal and an iron-plate output. The furnace has warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\".\n\n### Pipe Group at Position (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n- A pipe network consisting of pipes at positions (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5). The status of the pipe group is empty.\n\n### Electricity Group\n- Comprises electric poles positioned at (x=-4.5, y=22.5), (x=-3.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), ..., (x=0.5, y=21.5), (x=0.5, y=20.5), and (x=-1.5, y=16.5). The voltage is currently at 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure that the position selected for placing the offshore pump is suitable and has access to water. Repeated attempts to place the pump in unsuitable positions were noted.\n\n### Boiler Placement Issues\n- Verify that the position for placing a boiler is suitable and unoccupied. Errors were encountered when attempting to place boilers in unsuitable locations.\n\n### Connection Failures Between Entities\n- When connecting entities such as pipes and boilers, ensure that the connections are valid and that the entities are placed correctly to allow for successful connections.\n\n### Electric Pole Placement Issues\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed correctly to establish connections between them. Placement issues were noted, preventing successful connections.\n\n### Incorrect Data Types in Function Calls\n- When calling functions, ensure that the arguments provided are of the correct data type. Errors were encountered due to incorrect data types being used in function calls, such as attempting to place a boiler with an invalid argument type."}
