X.509 Verification
==================

.. currentmodule:: cryptography.x509.verification

.. module:: cryptography.x509.verification

Support for X.509 certificate verification, also known as path validation
or chain building.

.. note::
    While usable, these APIs should be considered unstable and not yet
    subject to our backwards compatibility policy.

Example usage, with `certifi <https://pypi.org/project/certifi/>`_ providing
the root of trust:

.. testsetup::

    from cryptography.x509 import load_pem_x509_certificate, load_pem_x509_certificates
    from datetime import datetime

    peer = load_pem_x509_certificate(b"""

.. class:: Store(certs)

    .. versionadded:: 42.0.0

    A Store is an opaque set of public keys and subject identifiers that are
    considered trusted *a priori*. Stores are typically created from the host
    OS's root of trust, from a well-known source such as a browser CA bundle,
    or from a small set of manually pre-trusted entities.

    :param certs: A list of one or more :class:`cryptography.x509.Certificate`
        instances.

.. class:: Subject

    .. versionadded:: 42.0.0

    Type alias: A union of all subject types supported:
    :class:`cryptography.x509.general_name.DNSName`,
    :class:`cryptography.x509.general_name.IPAddress`.

.. class:: VerifiedClient

    .. versionadded:: 43.0.0

    .. versionchanged:: 44.0.0
        Made ``subjects`` optional with the addition of custom extension policies.

    .. attribute:: subjects

        :type: list of :class:`~cryptography.x509.GeneralName` or None

        The subjects presented in the verified client's Subject Alternative Name
        extension or ``None`` if the extension is not present.

    .. attribute:: chain

        :type: A list of :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate`, in leaf-first order

        The chain of certificates that forms the valid chain to the client
        certificate.


.. class:: ClientVerifier

    .. versionadded:: 43.0.0

    A ClientVerifier verifies client certificates.

    It contains and describes various pieces of configurable path
    validation logic, such as how deep prospective validation chains may go,
    which signature algorithms are allowed, and so forth.

    ClientVerifier instances cannot be constructed directly;
    :class:`PolicyBuilder` must be used.

    .. attribute:: validation_time

        :type: :class:`datetime.datetime`

        The verifier's validation time.

    .. attribute:: max_chain_depth

        :type: :class:`int`

        The verifier's maximum intermediate CA chain depth.

    .. attribute:: store

        :type: :class:`Store`

        The verifier's trust store.

    .. method:: verify(leaf, intermediates)

        Performs path validation on ``leaf``, returning a valid path
        if one exists. The path is returned in leaf-first order:
        the first member is ``leaf``, followed by the intermediates used
        (if any), followed by a member of the ``store``.

        :param leaf: The leaf :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate` to validate
        :param intermediates: A :class:`list` of intermediate :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate` to attempt to use

        :returns:
            A new instance of :class:`VerifiedClient`

        :raises VerificationError: If a valid chain cannot be constructed

        :raises UnsupportedGeneralNameType: If a valid chain exists, but contains an unsupported general name type

.. class:: ServerVerifier

    .. versionadded:: 42.0.0

    A ServerVerifier verifies server certificates.

    It contains and describes various pieces of configurable path
    validation logic, such as which subject to expect, how deep prospective
    validation chains may go, which signature algorithms are allowed, and
    so forth.

    ServerVerifier instances cannot be constructed directly;
    :class:`PolicyBuilder` must be used.

    .. attribute:: subject

        :type: :class:`Subject`

        The verifier's subject.

    .. attribute:: validation_time

        :type: :class:`datetime.datetime`

        The verifier's validation time.

    .. attribute:: max_chain_depth

        :type: :class:`int`

        The verifier's maximum intermediate CA chain depth.

    .. attribute:: store

        :type: :class:`Store`

        The verifier's trust store.

    .. method:: verify(leaf, intermediates)

        Performs path validation on ``leaf``, returning a valid path
        if one exists. The path is returned in leaf-first order:
        the first member is ``leaf``, followed by the intermediates used
        (if any), followed by a member of the ``store``.

        :param leaf: The leaf :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate` to validate
        :param intermediates: A :class:`list` of intermediate :class:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate` to attempt to use

        :returns: A list containing a valid chain from ``leaf`` to a member of :class:`ServerVerifier.store`.

        :raises VerificationError: If a valid chain cannot be constructed

.. class:: VerificationError

    .. versionadded:: 42.0.0

    The error raised when path validation fails.

.. class:: PolicyBuilder

    .. versionadded:: 42.0.0

    A PolicyBuilder provides a builder-style interface for constructing a
    Verifier.

    .. method:: time(new_time)

        Sets the verifier's verification time.

        If not called explicitly, this is set to :meth:`datetime.datetime.now`
        when :meth:`build_server_verifier` or :meth:`build_client_verifier`
        is called.

        :param new_time: The :class:`datetime.datetime` to use in the verifier

        :returns: A new instance of :class:`PolicyBuilder`

    .. method:: store(new_store)

        Sets the verifier's trust store.

        :param new_store: The :class:`Store` to use in the verifier

        :returns: A new instance of :class:`PolicyBuilder`

    .. method:: max_chain_depth(new_max_chain_depth)

        Sets the verifier's maximum chain building depth.

        This depth behaves tracks the length of the intermediate CA
        chain: a maximum depth of zero means that the leaf must be directly
        issued by a member of the store, a depth of one means no more than
        one intermediate CA, and so forth. Note that self-issued intermediates
        don't count against the chain depth, per RFC 5280.

        :param new_max_chain_depth: The maximum depth to allow in the verifier

        :returns: A new instance of :class:`PolicyBuilder`

    .. method:: build_server_verifier(subject)

        Builds a verifier for verifying server certificates.

        :param subject: A :class:`Subject` to use in the verifier

        :returns: An instance of :class:`ServerVerifier`

    .. method:: build_client_verifier()

        .. versionadded:: 43.0.0

        Builds a verifier for verifying client certificates.

        .. warning::

            This API is not suitable for website (i.e. server) certificate
            verification. You **must** use :meth:`build_server_verifier`
            for server verification.

        :returns: An instance of :class:`ClientVerifier`
