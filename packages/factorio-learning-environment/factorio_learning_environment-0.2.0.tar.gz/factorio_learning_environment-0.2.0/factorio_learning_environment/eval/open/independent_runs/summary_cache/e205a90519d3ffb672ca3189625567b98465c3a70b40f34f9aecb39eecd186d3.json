{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5) and (-14.5, -45.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- Wooden chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Transport belts connecting the furnaces and chests, facilitating the movement of iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Infrastructure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5) for extracting water.\n- Boilers at positions (-9.5, 22.0), (-3.5, 22.0), and (0.5, 22.0) for generating steam.\n- Pipe groups connecting the offshore pump to the boilers for water transport.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple pipe groups at various positions, including (-6.5, 1.5), (-4.5, 0.5), and (-2.5, 3.5), for fluid transportation.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity poles at various positions, including (-9.5, -33.5) and (-9.5, 2.5), for power distribution.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt groups facilitating the movement of iron plates from production to storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on water\n- Ensure that the target tile is not occupied by water before attempting to place entities like pipes or boilers. Consider using landfill to create solid ground if necessary.\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. Ensure that the crafting queue is not full.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Check that the entities to be connected are within the allowable distance and that the correct type of connector (e.g., pipes) is used. Ensure that all necessary components are available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Regularly check inventory levels to ensure that there are enough items available for placement or crafting. Consider automating the production of frequently used items to maintain a steady supply."}
