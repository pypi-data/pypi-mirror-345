{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), refueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), refueled with coal, extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5), storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5), transferring items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. This will prevent errors related to attempting to insert non-existent items.\n\n### Errors when Chests are Full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills. This will prevent warnings and interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n### Errors when Furnaces Lack Ingredients\n- Monitor the ingredient levels in furnaces to prevent them from running out of materials to process. This will avoid warnings and ensure continuous production."}
