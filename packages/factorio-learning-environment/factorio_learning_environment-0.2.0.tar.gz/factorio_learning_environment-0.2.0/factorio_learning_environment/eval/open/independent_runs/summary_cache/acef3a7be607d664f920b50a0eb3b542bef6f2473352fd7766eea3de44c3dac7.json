{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with status `NO_FUEL`\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with status `NO_INGREDIENTS`\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) with status `NO_FUEL`\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with status `NO_INGREDIENTS`\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Placing Wooden Chests\n- Ensure there is sufficient space available before attempting to place a wooden chest. This error occurred multiple times, indicating a need to check the target area for obstructions.\n\n### Fuel Management for Mining Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel. Both the iron and copper mining drills reported `NO_FUEL` status.\n\n### Resource Availability for Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients for smelting. Both iron and copper furnaces reported `NO_INGREDIENTS` status.\n\n### Output Blockage in Copper Mining Drill\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity to accept the output from the copper mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'stone-furnace', 'stone', 'iron-plate', and 'copper-plate'."}
