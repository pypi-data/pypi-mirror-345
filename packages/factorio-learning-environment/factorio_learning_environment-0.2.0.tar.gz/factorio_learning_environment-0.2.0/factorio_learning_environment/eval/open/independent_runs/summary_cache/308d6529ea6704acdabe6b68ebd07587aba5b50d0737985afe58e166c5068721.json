{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Collection and Transfer System at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) for coal extraction.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) to transfer coal from the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to collect coal from the inserter.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing an entity is clear of other objects. Check for existing entities before attempting to place a new one.\n\n### Errors with entity dimensions and placement\n- Verify the dimensions and placement logic for entities like Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters. Ensure that the dimensions are correctly defined and that there is enough space for placement.\n\n### Errors related to type conversion in code\n- When using type conversion functions like `int()`, ensure that the input is a valid string, bytes-like object, or real number. Avoid using incompatible types such as 'ModelPrivateAttr'.\n\n### Errors with entity alignment and positioning\n- When aligning entities like inserters and chests, ensure that their positions are correctly calculated and adjusted to match each other\u2019s drop or pickup positions.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills or furnaces. Regularly check for warnings about blocked outputs and address them by adjusting entity positions or adding necessary entities.\n\n### Errors with realigning entities\n- When realigning entities such as inserters or chests, ensure that the new positions are valid and do not conflict with existing entities."}
