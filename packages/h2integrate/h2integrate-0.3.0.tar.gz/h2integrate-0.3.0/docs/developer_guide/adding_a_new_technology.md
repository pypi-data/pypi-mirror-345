# Adding a new technology to new H2Integrate

This doc page describes the steps to add a new technology to the new H2Integrate.
In broad strokes, this involves writing performance and cost wrappers for your technology in the format that H2Integrate expects, then adding those to the list of available technologies in the H2Integrate codebase.
We'll first walk through a relatively straightforward example of adding a new technology, then discuss some of the more complex cases you might encounter.

## Adding a new technology

We'll start by walking through the process to add a simple solar performance model to H2Integrate.

1. Determine what type of technology you're adding and if it fits into an existing H2Integrate bucket.
In this case, we're adding a solar technology, which has an existing set of baseclasses that we will use.
These baseclasses are defined in `h2integrate/converters/solar/solar_baseclass.py`.
They provide the basic structure for a solar technology, including the required inputs and outputs for the models.
Here's what that baseclass looks like:

```python
class SolarPerformanceBaseClass(om.ExplicitComponent):

    def initialize(self):
        self.options.declare('plant_config', types=dict)
        self.options.declare('tech_config', types=dict)

    def setup(self):
        self.add_output('electricity', val=0.0, shape=n_timesteps, units='kW', desc='Power output from SolarPlant')

    def compute(self, inputs, outputs):
        """
        Computation for the OM component.

        For a template class this is not implement and raises an error.
        """

        raise NotImplementedError("This method should be implemented in a subclass.")
```

2. Write the performance model for your technology.
We'll be wrapping a PySAM model for this example.
We inherit from the baseclass and implement the `setup` and `compute` methods.
The baseclass describes the required inputs and outputs that the model should have, and the `compute` method is where the actual computation happens.
In this case, we only need to compute the electricity output from the solar plant.
Here's what the performance model looks like:

```python
class PYSAMSolarPlantPerformanceComponent(SolarPerformanceBaseClass):
    """
    An OpenMDAO component that wraps a SolarPlant model.
    It takes wind parameters as input and outputs power generation data.
    """
    def setup(self):
        super().setup()
        self.config_name = "PVWattsSingleOwner"
        self.system_model = Pvwatts.default(self.config_name)

        lat = self.options['plant_config']['site']['latitude']
        lon = self.options['plant_config']['site']['longitude']
        year = self.options['plant_config']['site']['year']
        solar_resource = SolarResource(lat, lon, year)
        self.system_model.value("solar_resource_data", solar_resource.data)

    def compute(self, inputs, outputs):
        self.system_model.execute(0)
        outputs['electricity'] = self.system_model.Outputs.gen
```

```{note}
The `setup` method is where we initialize the PySAM model and set the solar resource data.
We call the baseclass's `setup` method using the `super()` function, then added additional setup steps for the PySAM model.
```

3. Write the cost model for your technology.
For this simplistic case, we will skip the cost model.
The process for writing a cost model is similar to the performance model, with the required inputs and outputs defined in the baseclass.

4. Next, add the new technology to the `supported_models.py` file.
This file contains a dictionary of all the available technologies in H2Integrate.
Add your new technology to the dictionary with the appropriate keys depending on if it a performance, cost, or financial model.
Here's what the updated `supported_models.py` file looks like with our new solar technology added as the first entry:

```python
from h2integrate.converters.solar.solar_pysam import PYSAMSolarPlantPerformanceComponent

supported_models = {
    'pysam_solar_plant_performance' : PYSAMSolarPlantPerformanceComponent,

    'pem_electrolyzer_performance': ElectrolyzerPerformanceModel,
    'pem_electrolyzer_cost': ElectrolyzerCostModel,
    'pem_electrolyzer_financial': ElectrolyzerFinanceModel,

    'eco_pem_electrolyzer_performance': ECOElectrolyzerPerformanceModel,
    'eco_pem_electrolyzer_cost': ECOElectrolyzerCostModel,

    ...
}
```

5. Finally, you can now use your new technology in H2Integrate.
You can create a new case that uses this technology in the `tech_config.yaml` level or add it to an existing scenario and run the model to see the results.


## More complex cases

Adding a new technology to H2Integrate can be more complex than the simple example we walked through.
For example, your technology might not fit into an existing bucket, or you might need to add additional inputs or outputs than what's defined in the baseclass.
Let's briefly discuss these cases and how to handle them.

### Adding a new technology type

Take the case where you're adding a new technology that doesn't fit into an existing bucket, e.g. a nuclear power plant.
If you're adding multiple models that will exist in that new space, it would make sense to create a new baseclass that defines the required inputs and outputs for your technology.
You can then inherit from that baseclass in your performance and cost models.
If you're only making a single model, a baseclass isn't necessary, and you can define the required inputs and outputs directly in your models.
This shouldn't be a prohibitively challenging step, but it's generally easier to add technologies that fit into existing buckets as you can draw from those examples.

### Adding additional inputs or outputs

If you need to add additional inputs or outputs to the baseclass, you can do so by adding them to the `setup` method.
This would look like the following:

```python
class ECOElectrolyzerPerformanceModel(ElectrolyzerPerformanceBaseClass):
    """
    An OpenMDAO component that wraps the PEM electrolyzer model.
    Takes electricity input and outputs hydrogen and oxygen generation rates.
    """
    def setup(self):
        super().setup()
        self.add_output('efficiency', val=0.0, desc='Average efficiency of the electrolyzer')
```

### Models where the performance and cost are tightly coupled

In some cases, the performance and cost models are tightly coupled, and it might make sense to combine them into a single model.
This is currently the case for the HOPP and h2_storage wrappers, where the performance and cost models are combined into a single component.
If you're adding a technology where this makes sense, you can follow the same steps as above but you also need to modify the `h2integrate_model.py` file for this special logic.
For now, modify a single  the `create_technology_models.py` file to include your new technology as such:

```python
combined_performance_and_cost_model_technologies = ['hopp', 'h2_storage', '<your_tech_here>']

# Create a technology group for each technology
for tech_name, individual_tech_config in self.technology_config['technologies'].items():
    if 'feedstocks' in tech_name:
        feedstock_component = FeedstockComponent(feedstocks_config=individual_tech_config)
        self.plant.add_subsystem(tech_name, feedstock_component)
    else:
        tech_group = self.plant.add_subsystem(tech_name, om.Group())
        self.tech_names.append(tech_name)

        # Special HOPP handling for short-term
        if tech_name in combined_performance_and_cost_model_technologies:
```


### Other cases

If you encounter a case that isn't covered here, please discuss it with the H2Integrate dev team for guidance.
H2Integrate is constantly evolving and we plan to encounter new challenges as we add more technologies to the model.
Your feedback and suggestions help you and others use H2Integrate successfully.
