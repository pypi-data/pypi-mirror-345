{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), and several pipes connecting these entities. The steam engine is currently not connected due to lack of input liquid.\n\n### Boiler setup at position(-21.5, 28.0)\nConsists of a boiler (position -21.5, 28.0) and multiple pipes connecting to it. The boiler is not connected and has warnings for out of fuel and no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure you are within the maximum distance to place pipes. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place a pipe.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes overlapping with water\n- Avoid placing pipes in locations where their footprint overlaps with water. Check the position before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when connecting boilers\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to a water source and that there are no obstructions in the connection path.\n\n### Errors with missing ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that there are sufficient ingredients available for the furnaces to operate. Check inventory and supply lines to prevent running out of materials.\n\n### Errors with missing science packs in labs\n- Ensure that the lab has the required science packs available to conduct research. Check inventory and supply lines to prevent research from stalling."}
