{"content": "Based on the provided logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around position 41, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Connected to multiple storage chests:\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -84.5) storing coal\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around position 46, -80)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input chest (wooden) at (45.5, -79.5) containing iron ore\n- Output chest (wooden) at (49.5, -80.5) storing iron plates\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (45.5, -78.5)\n  - Second inserter at (47.5, -78.5)\n- Additional wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is free from other entities\n- Multiple attempts to place burner-inserters failed due to existing objects in the way\n- Consider scanning the area for existing entities before placement attempts\n\n### Storage Management\n- Coal storage system is reaching capacity limits with multiple \"chest is full\" warnings\n- Implement a system to balance or manage chest contents before they become full\n- Mining operations are being blocked by full output chests\n\n### Automation Efficiency\n- Burner mining drill is inactive due to full output chest and lack of fuel\n- Create a system to automatically empty full chests to prevent production bottlenecks\n- Ensure fuel supply is maintained for burner devices\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter\n\nFunctions observed being used:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map, fails if location is occupied\n- rotate_entity(): Changes entity direction\n\nEntity States:\n- Furnaces maintain fuel inventory (coal: ~50 units)\n- Burner inserters maintain fuel inventory (coal: 49 units)\n- Storage chests have varying capacities (iron chests: 1600 coal, wooden chests: variable)"}
