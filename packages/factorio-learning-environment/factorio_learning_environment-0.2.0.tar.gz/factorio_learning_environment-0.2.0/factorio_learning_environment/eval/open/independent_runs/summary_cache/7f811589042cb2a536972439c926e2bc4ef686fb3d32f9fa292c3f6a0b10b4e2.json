{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Lab at position (2.5, -18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (2.5, -18.5))\n\n### Electricity generator at position (-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position (-11.5, 18.5))\n- Boiler (position (-11.5, 25.0))\n- Offshore pump (position (-9.5, 24.5))\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump and boiler (positions (-9.5, 23.5) to (-11.5, 25.0) and (-11.5, 21.5))\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (0, 0)) and a furnace (position (0, 0))\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (5, 5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (5, 5)) and a furnace (position (5, 5))\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are within the correct range and that there are no obstructions between them. In particular, verify the positions of the offshore pump and boiler before attempting to connect them with pipes.\n\n### Errors when using electric poles\n- Confirm that electric poles are placed correctly and are within range of the entities they need to power. Check the connections to ensure that the lab is receiving power.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities that may occupy the intended position."}
