{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\n- **Offshore pump** at position (-9.5, -0.5) - Provides water to the boiler\n- **Boiler** at position (-3.0, 2.5) - Heats water using coal to produce steam\n- **Steam engine** at position (1.5, 2.5) - Converts steam into electricity\n- **Pipes** connecting offshore pump to boiler (8 pipes) and boiler to steam engine (18 pipes)\n- **Power poles** creating an electricity network (multiple positions)\n\n### Oil Extraction\n- **Pumpjack** at position (17.5, 40.5) - Extracts crude oil (currently not powered)\n- **Power poles** attempting to connect pumpjack to power grid (multiple positions)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Prototype naming errors\n- Use correct prototype names (e.g., `PumpJack` instead of `Pumpjack`)\n- Check exact spelling and capitalization of prototype names before use\n\n### Entity placement issues\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing entities\n- Avoid placing entities on water or occupied tiles\n- Verify terrain is suitable for placement (not water or obstructed)\n\n### Power system problems\n- Connect all components properly (water pipes, steam pipes, power poles)\n- Verify steam engine is correctly connected to boiler output\n- Ensure boiler has fuel and is properly connected to water source\n- Check power pole connections form a continuous network\n\n### Assertion errors\n- Verify entity status before asserting working condition\n- Check power requirements are met before expecting working status\n- Ensure all connections (fluid and power) are properly established\n\n### Power transmission\n- Use appropriate number of power poles for distance\n- Verify power poles connect to both power source and consumer\n- Check electricity network has continuous connection from generator to consumer"}
