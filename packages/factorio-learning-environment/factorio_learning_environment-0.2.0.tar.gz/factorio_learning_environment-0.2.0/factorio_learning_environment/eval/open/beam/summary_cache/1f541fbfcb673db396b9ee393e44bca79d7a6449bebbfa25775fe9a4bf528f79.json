{"content": "The error message indicates that the attempt to place a `SmallElectricPole` at position `(3.5, 0.5)` failed because there are no `small_electric_pole` items available in the inventory. This is a common issue when trying to expand the power network without having the necessary resources.\n\n### Steps to Address the Error:\n\n1. **Check Inventory for Small Electric Poles:**\n   Before attempting to place any new entities, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory.\n\n2. **Acquire Small Electric Poles:**\n   If there are no `SmallElectricPole` items in the inventory, you need to craft or acquire them. This can be done by either crafting them manually if you have the necessary resources (wood and copper cable) or by retrieving them from a storage chest if available.\n\n3. **Re-attempt Placement:**\n   Once you have the `SmallElectricPole` in your inventory, you can attempt to place it again.\n\n### Example Code to Check and Acquire Small Electric Poles:\n\n```python\n# Check current inventory for Small Electric Poles\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nsmall_electric_poles_available = current_inventory.get(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, 0)\n\n# If not available, attempt to craft or acquire\nif small_electric_poles_available == 0:\n    # Check if we have the resources to craft Small Electric Poles\n    wood_needed = 2  # Example requirement\n    copper_cable_needed = 2  # Example requirement\n    \n    if current_inventory.get(Prototype.Wood, 0) >= wood_needed and current_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0) >= copper_cable_needed:\n        # Craft Small Electric Poles\n        craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, quantity=1)\n    else:\n        print(\"Insufficient resources to craft Small Electric Poles. Please gather more wood and copper cable.\")\n\n# Re-attempt to place the Small Electric Pole\npower_pole_entity = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, power_pole_position)\n\n# Check placement success\nif power_pole_entity:\n    connect_entities(power_pole_entity, assembling_machine_entity, connection_type=Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to place Small Electric Pole. Ensure you have it in your inventory.\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n\n- **Inventory Management:** Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for construction and crafting.\n- **Resource Gathering:** Plan ahead by gathering and storing essential resources like wood, iron plates, and copper cables.\n- **Error Handling:** Implement checks and error messages to guide you when resources are insufficient, helping you quickly identify and resolve issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage your resources and ensure that your power network is properly set up.", "summary_range": "[1-98]"}
