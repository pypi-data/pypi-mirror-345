{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=5.5, y=-60.5)\n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=4.5, y=-58.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (9998 units)\n\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing Iron Ore (7 units)\n  - Additional chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) with no contents\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Ingredients: Iron Ore (3 units)\n  - Products: Iron Plate (39 units)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Ingredients: None\n  - Products: Iron Plate (61 units)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal (12 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Products: Iron Plate (52 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting. The chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) is full, which stops the burner mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain production. The furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) is not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory state, including items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
