{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position (2.5, 2.5))\n- Small electric pole (position (0.5, 1.5))\n\n### Lab at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (3.5, 0.5)) which requires 10 automation science packs to complete automation research but is currently not powered.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel (coal: 18) and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace (position (2.0, 0.0)) with fuel (coal: 7) but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 0.5)) with no items in inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new poles\n- Ensure that the arguments passed to the pole placement function are correct and do not conflict with each other. Check for any misplaced or obstructing entities before attempting to place a new pole.\n\n### Errors when the lab is not powered\n- Verify that the lab is connected to a power source. If the lab is not powered, check the surrounding electric poles and ensure they are functioning properly.\n\n### Errors when needing ingredients for research\n- Ensure that you have the required ingredients in your inventory before starting research. In this case, ensure you have at least 10 automation science packs available.\n\n### Errors when picking up obstructing entities\n- Make sure to pick up any obstructing entities before attempting to place new structures or poles. Double-check the positions of entities to avoid conflicts."}
