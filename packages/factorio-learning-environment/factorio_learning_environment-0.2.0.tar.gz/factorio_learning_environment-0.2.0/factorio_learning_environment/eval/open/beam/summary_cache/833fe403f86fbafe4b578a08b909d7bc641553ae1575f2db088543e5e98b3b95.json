{"content": "It seems like there is a persistent issue with the `random` module not being recognized, despite the import statement being included. This could be due to an environment-specific issue or a misunderstanding in how the code is executed in the Factorio REPL environment.\n\nHere are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Import**: Double-check that the `import random` statement is at the very top of your script, before any other code that uses `random`.\n\n2. **Environment Check**: Verify if the environment where this script is being executed supports standard Python libraries like `random`. If not, you might need to find an alternative way to generate random numbers.\n\n3. **Test in a Local Environment**: If possible, run the script in a local Python environment to see if the issue persists. This can help determine if the problem is with the script or the execution environment.\n\n4. **Alternative Random Function**: If the environment does not support the `random` module, you can try using a simple alternative method to generate random numbers. For example, using a basic linear congruential generator (LCG) for random numbers:\n\n   ```python\n   def simple_random(min_val, max_val):\n       # A simple linear congruential generator for demonstration\n       seed = 12345\n       a = 1103515245\n       c = 12345\n       m = 2**31\n       seed = (a * seed + c) % m\n       return min_val + (seed % (max_val - min_val))\n\n   # Use simple_random instead of random.uniform\n   position = Position(simple_random(-10, 10), simple_random(-10, 10))\n   ```\n\n5. **Debugging Output**: Add print statements to verify if the import is being executed and to check the flow of the script. This can help identify where the script might be failing.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be helpful to consult the documentation or support for the specific environment you are using to see if there are any known limitations or alternative methods for generating random numbers.", "summary_range": "[1-338]"}
