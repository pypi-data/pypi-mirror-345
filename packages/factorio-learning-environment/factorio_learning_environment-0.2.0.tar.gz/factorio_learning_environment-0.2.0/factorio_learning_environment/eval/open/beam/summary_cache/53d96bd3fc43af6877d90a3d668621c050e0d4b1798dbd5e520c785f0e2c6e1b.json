{"content": "The error indicates that `furnace_empty` is not defined. Let's correct this by explicitly checking the furnace inventory to determine if it's empty before attempting any insertions. Here's the revised approach:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check the player's inventory for coal and ores\nplayer_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Player Inventory: {player_inventory}\")\n\n# Step 2: Check if the furnace is empty\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nis_furnace_empty = all(count == 0 for count in furnace_inventory.values())\nprint(f\"Furnace Inventory: {furnace_inventory}\")\nprint(f\"Is Furnace Empty: {is_furnace_empty}\")\n\n# Step 3: Attempt to insert coal if the furnace is empty\nif is_furnace_empty and player_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) > 0:\n    try:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace_entity, quantity=1)\n        print(\"Coal inserted successfully.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to insert coal: {e}\")\n\n# Step 4: Attempt to insert iron ore if the furnace is empty\nif is_furnace_empty and player_inventory.get(Prototype.IronOre, 0) > 0:\n    try:\n        insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace_entity, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Iron Ore inserted successfully into the furnace.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to insert iron ore: {e}\")\n\n# Step 5: Final check of the furnace inventory\nfinal_furnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(f\"Furnace Inventory after insertions: {final_furnace_inventory}\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet ensures that we check both the player's inventory and the furnace's inventory before attempting to insert items. It also handles exceptions gracefully and provides detailed logging for each step.", "summary_range": "[1-86]"}
