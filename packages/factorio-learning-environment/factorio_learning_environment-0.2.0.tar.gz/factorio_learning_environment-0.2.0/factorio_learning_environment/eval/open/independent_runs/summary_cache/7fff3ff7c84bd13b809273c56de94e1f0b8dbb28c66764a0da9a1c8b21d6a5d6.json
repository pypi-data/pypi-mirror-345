{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel (5 coal) and input (1 iron ore). It has produced 31 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Storage at position (40.5, -82.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Coal resource patch (position (40.5, -82.5)) from which 20 coal has been harvested in total.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inventory contains 31 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inventory contains 10 iron ore.\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inventory contains 18 iron gear wheels.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to craft entities. In this case, there were not enough resources to craft an Assembling Machine.\n- Always check your inventory for required items before executing crafting actions to avoid running into resource shortages.\n- If an assertion error occurs indicating a lack of items, verify your inventory and ensure you have the necessary components before proceeding with actions that depend on those items.\n- When attempting to craft items that require sub-ingredients (e.g., Iron Gear Wheel requires Iron Plate), ensure you have the means to produce those sub-ingredients, such as a furnace or crafting machine.\n- Ensure that the furnace has enough fuel and input materials before starting the smelting process to avoid smelting timeouts.\n- Be mindful of the furnace inventory to avoid extracting more items than available.\n- When checking required ingredients for crafting, ensure you have enough of each required component to avoid crafting failures.\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace for fuel.\n- Verify that you are aware of the current inventory levels to avoid confusion when managing resources, especially after harvesting.\n- Ensure that the furnace has sufficient input materials (iron ore) before attempting to smelt to avoid idle time.\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace for fuel, as the recent error indicates a lack of coal to insert.\n- Ensure that the furnace has ingredients to smelt; otherwise, it will remain idle and not produce any items.\n- Ensure you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace, as indicated by the recent error when trying to insert iron ore.\n- After inserting iron ore into the furnace, ensure to monitor the inventory to confirm the correct amount of resources is available for future actions.\n- Ensure you have enough iron plates in your inventory before crafting iron gear wheels to avoid running out of materials.\n- Ensure you have sufficient inventory space when harvesting resources to avoid losing items."}
