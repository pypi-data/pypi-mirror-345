{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab connected to the power network\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the lab\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Lab Identification\n- Ensure the correct entity type is used when checking for labs. The error \"name 'Lab' is not defined\" suggests a possible typo or incorrect entity reference.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect pipes.\n- Verify that the pipe connections are correctly aligned and connected to the intended entities.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine and Boiler Connection\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly connected from the offshore pump to the boiler and from the boiler to the steam engine. Misalignment or missing connections can prevent the steam engine from working.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and maintain sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel the boiler. Running out of fuel will halt the electricity generation process.\n\n### Assertion Errors with Steam Engine Status\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity generation system are correctly connected and operational to avoid assertion errors related to the steam engine's status."}
