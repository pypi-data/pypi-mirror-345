{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Placement\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collision with existing entities when placing an inserter. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the alignment and operation of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they are set correctly.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation."}
