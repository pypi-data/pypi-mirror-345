(Step 8: 'oil_refinery' is not defined, Step 13: 'elect' is not defined, Step 29: bad operand type for unary -: 'type', Step 41: 'get_connection_amount' is not defined, Step 62: name 'inserter' is not defined, Step 63: name 'This' is not defined, Step 93: name 'entity' is not defined, Step 106: name 'o' is not defined)\n\n### Errors when getting entities\n- Verify that entities exist at the specified position before attempting to access them. (Step 9: No entity of type oil-refinery found at the specified position, Step 19: No resource of type copper-ore at the specified location, Step 34: Could not get Prototype.ChemicalPlant at position x=0.0 y=0.0)\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that source entities have the required fluid before connecting to other entities. (Step 11: The source does not have fluid in it, Step 41: Did not find any valid connections between source Prototype.OffshorePump and target Prototype.Boiler)\n- Ensure that entities have a recipe set before connecting them. (Step 12: Cannot connect to a Prototype.OilRefinery until a recipe has been set)\n- Check the type of entity being connected. (Step 60: Error connecting offshore pump to boiler: 'pipe-to-ground', Step 60: Error connecting boiler to steam engine: 'pipe-to-ground', Step 68: Error connecting offshore pump to boiler: 'pipe-to-ground', Step 68: Error connecting boiler to steam engine: 'pipe-to-ground', Step 23: Error connecting offshore pump to boiler: 'pipe-to-ground', Step 29: Error connecting boiler to steam engine: 'pipe-to-ground', Step 77: Error connecting offshore pump to boiler: Did not find any valid connections between"}
