{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) refueled regularly, extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (40.5, -83.5), (42.5, -83.5), (43.5, -83.5), and (44.5, -83.5) used for coal storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal between entities.\n- **Transport Belts** and **Belt Groups** connecting various entities, though facing pathing issues.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (61.0, -54.0) and (64.0, -53.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (62.5, -53.5) and (65.5, -52.5) for moving materials between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (61.5, -52.5) for storing intermediate products.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- **Failed to Connect Belts**: Ensure that the path for connecting belts is clear and valid. Check for obstacles or incorrect alignment that might prevent successful connection.\n- **Path Normalization Issues**: Verify that the intended path for belts is feasible and correctly aligned with existing structures.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (41.5, -83.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (65.5, -52.5) are waiting for source items. Ensure that the supply of source items is continuous and that the inserters are correctly positioned to pick up items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **Belt Connection Function**: Attempts to connect belts between specified positions. Currently failing due to path normalization issues. Ensure that the function checks for valid paths before attempting connections.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **Inventory Variables**: Track quantities of items such as 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- **Entity Positions**: Maintain accurate records of entity positions for troubleshooting and planning expansions."}
