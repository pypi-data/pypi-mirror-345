{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and Steam Engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at Position (not specified) with input for automation science packs\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including the Inserter and Lab\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, make sure you have coal before trying to insert it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established. Check that pipes are connected to both the input and output of boilers and steam engines to allow fluid flow.\n\n### Errors with Power Connections\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to the electricity network. Ensure that electric poles are properly placed and connected to provide power to inserters and labs.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full inventory."}
