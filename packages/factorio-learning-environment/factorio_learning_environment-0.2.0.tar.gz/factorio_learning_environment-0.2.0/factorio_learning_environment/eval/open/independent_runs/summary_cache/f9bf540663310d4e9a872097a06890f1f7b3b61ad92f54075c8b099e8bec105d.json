{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) with status EntityStatus.WORKING, currently extracting resources.\n- Wooden Chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) with status EntityStatus.NORMAL, currently holding coal.\n- The Burner Mining Drill has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5) for depositing extracted resources.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) with status EntityStatus.NORMAL, currently empty after extraction activities.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) with status EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS, currently unable to smelt due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when extracting from a wooden chest that is empty**\n  - Ensure the wooden chest has sufficient items before attempting to extract. Check the inventory status before extraction.\n  \n- **Errors when the Burner Mining Drill runs out of fuel**\n  - Regularly monitor the fuel levels of the Burner Mining Drill. Ensure it is refueled promptly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n- **Errors when trying to extract from a full wooden chest**\n  - Empty the wooden chest before further extraction attempts. The chest must have available space to allow for additional items.\n\n- **Errors when the wooden chest is full**\n  - Keep track of the wooden chest's inventory. If it reaches capacity, stop extraction until it is emptied.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `extract_item(item_type, position, quantity)`: Used for extracting items from entities. \n    - **Failure Mode**: Could not extract coal at (41.5, -80.5) due to the chest being empty.\n    - **Success Mode**: Successfully extracts items when the chest has available inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `extracted_coal`: int\n  - `wooden_chest`: object (Chest)\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: object (BurnerMiningDrill)\n  - `final_inventory`: dict (Inventory status)"}
