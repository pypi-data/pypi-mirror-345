Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position if an entity already occupies the target position.\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. Ensure that burner-inserters or other required items are available in your inventory to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function correctly. Check the supply chain and ensure that materials are being delivered to the inserters' source positions.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters with incorrect spacing or direction\n- When placing inserters, ensure that the spacing and direction are appropriate for the target position. Adjust the spacing or direction if there is a collision with existing entities or if the area cannot accommodate the placement.\n\n### Errors due to entity already existing at the target position\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target position is free of other entities. Remove any existing entities if necessary to make space for the new placement.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect belts directly from chests\n- Use inserters to transfer items from chests to belts. Direct connections between belts and chests are not possible without an inserter."}
