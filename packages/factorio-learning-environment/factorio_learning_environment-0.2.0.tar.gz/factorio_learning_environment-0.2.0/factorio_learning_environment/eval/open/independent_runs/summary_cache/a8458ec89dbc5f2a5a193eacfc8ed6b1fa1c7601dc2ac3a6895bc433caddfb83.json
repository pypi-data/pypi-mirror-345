{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 24.0): Currently out of fuel.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-1.5, 24.5): Not connected, with no input liquid or fluid present in connections.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5): Working status, supplying water.\n- **Pipe Group**: Connects the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, facilitating water flow.\n\n### Research Lab\n- **Lab**: Input includes 28 automation science packs, but no research is currently in progress.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (6.0, -62.0): Contains copper plates but lacks ingredients to smelt more.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, `entities_on_map` was not defined, causing a `NameError`. Verify variable names and ensure they are initialized.\n\n### Incorrect Object References\n- Use the correct object names and references. The error with `Lab` suggests using the correct case or checking for object existence. Consider using `lab` if that is the correct reference.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers to maintain functionality. The boiler is currently out of fuel, which disrupts the electricity generation process.\n\n### Research Management\n- Initiate research in the lab to utilize available science packs and progress in technology development."}
