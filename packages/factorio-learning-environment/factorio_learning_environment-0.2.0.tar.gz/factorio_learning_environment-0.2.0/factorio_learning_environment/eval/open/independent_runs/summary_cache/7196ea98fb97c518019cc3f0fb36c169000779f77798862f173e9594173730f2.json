{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore. It consists of:\n- **Furnace** at position (-15.0, -50.0): This stone furnace is fueled by coal and processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -49.5): This inserter is responsible for transferring items between the furnace and the wooden chest. It is fueled by coal and has been rotated to align correctly with the furnace and chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -49.5): This chest stores the output from the furnace, which is facilitated by the burner inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, attempting to insert coal or iron ore into the furnace without having them in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Always verify the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items between entities. Rotating the inserter to align with the furnace and chest can resolve issues where items are not being transferred as expected."}
