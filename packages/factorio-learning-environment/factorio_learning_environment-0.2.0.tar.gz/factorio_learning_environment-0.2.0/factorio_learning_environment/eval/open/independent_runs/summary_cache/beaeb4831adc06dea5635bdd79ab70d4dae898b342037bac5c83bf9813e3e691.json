{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore.\n- Transport Belt connecting the chest to another chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-20.0, -70.0) and (-21.0, -62.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-20.5, -63.5) and (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chests at various positions (e.g., (-17.5, -69.5), (-15.5, -69.5), (-14.5, -64.5), etc.) storing various items like iron plates, iron ore, and copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chests are not empty before connecting them to inserters. Verify that the inserter's source chest contains items to be transferred.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Make sure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain to ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items from Empty Chests\n- Verify that the chests connected to inserters contain items. Consider automating the supply of items to these chests to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### General Tips for Avoiding Errors\n- Regularly monitor the status of all entities to ensure they are functioning correctly.\n- Automate the supply chain to maintain a consistent flow of resources to production units."}
