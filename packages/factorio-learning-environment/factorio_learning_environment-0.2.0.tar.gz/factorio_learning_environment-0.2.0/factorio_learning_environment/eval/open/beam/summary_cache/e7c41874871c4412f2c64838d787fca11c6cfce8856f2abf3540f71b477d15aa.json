{"content": "I notice from the output that the mining drill is showing \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" and the inserter is showing \"WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\". We need to:\n\n1. Place a chest as the destination for the inserter\n2. Correctly position the inserter between the drill's output and the chest\n\nLet's fix this:\n\n```python\n# First get our drill\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Found drill at {drill.position} with drop position at {drill.drop_position}\")\n\n# Place a wooden chest near the drill's output\nchest = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at {chest.position}\")\n\n# Now place the inserter between drill output and chest\ninserter = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to the inserter\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\nprint(\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Verify the setup\nprint(f\"Drill drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter pickup position: {inserter.pickup_position}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter drop position: {inserter.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Chest position: {chest.position}\")\n\n# Check statuses\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter status: {inserter.status}\")\nprint(f\"Chest status: {chest.status}\")\n```\n\nThis should create a proper chain where:\n1. The drill outputs to its drop position\n2. The inserter picks up from that position\n3. The inserter drops into the chest\n4. The chest provides storage space for the items", "summary_range": "[1-2890]"}
