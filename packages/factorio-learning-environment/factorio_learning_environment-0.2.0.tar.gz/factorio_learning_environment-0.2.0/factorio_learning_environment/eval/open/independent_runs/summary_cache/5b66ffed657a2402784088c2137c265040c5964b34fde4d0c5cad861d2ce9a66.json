{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces have failed, resulting in no entities being successfully placed or constructed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when finding buildable spots\n- Ensure that the area where you want to place entities like the Burner Mining Drill is clear and has enough space. Consider using smaller BuildingBox sizes or multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if space is constrained.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Before attempting to place entities like Burner Mining Drills or Stone Furnaces, verify that the desired location is valid and unoccupied. Ensure that the placement logic checks for available space and does not attempt to place entities on occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are properly defined before use. For instance, the error \"NameError: name 'furnace' is not defined\" suggests that the variable 'furnace' was referenced before being assigned a value. Double-check your code to ensure all necessary variables are initialized.\n\n### Errors with moving to positions\n- When using the move_to function, ensure that the position indices are integers and not strings. This will prevent exceptions related to incorrect data types.\n\n### General placement errors\n- When placing entities like the Burner Mining Drill or Stone Furnace, ensure that the specified positions are accessible and not blocked by other entities or terrain features. Double-check the logic that determines valid positions for these entities."}
