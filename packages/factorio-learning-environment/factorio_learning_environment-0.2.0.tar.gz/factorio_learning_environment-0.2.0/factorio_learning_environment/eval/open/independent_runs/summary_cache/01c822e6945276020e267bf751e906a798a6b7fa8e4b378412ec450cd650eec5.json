{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units)\n  - Warning: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (12 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Neighbours:\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - Transport Belt at position (x=-12.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-14.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-12.5, y=-51.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (11 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (10 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Neighbours:\n    - Transport Belt at position (x=0.5, y=-2.5)\n    - Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=0.5, y=-2.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=0.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### Belt Group\n- Inputs: Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction RIGHT\n- Outputs: Belt from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction DOWN\n- Status: Empty\n- Belts: 75 belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a mining drill failed due to lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to full output chests\n- Regularly check and empty output chests to prevent blockages in production lines. The chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) is full, which halts the mining process.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int) -> Entity`: Used to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. \n  - Failure Mode: Attempting to insert an item when the inventory does not have the required quantity results in an error.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `mining_drill`: Represents the mining drill entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wood', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
