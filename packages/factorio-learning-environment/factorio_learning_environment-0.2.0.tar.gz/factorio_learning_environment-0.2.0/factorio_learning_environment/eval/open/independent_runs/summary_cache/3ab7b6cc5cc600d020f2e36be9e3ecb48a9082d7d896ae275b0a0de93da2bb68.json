{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of multiple furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position(2.0, 0.0) \n- Stone furnace at position(4.0, 4.0) with coal fuel and 2 iron plates in output\n- Stone furnace at position(6.0, 4.0) with coal fuel\n\n###Inserter Assembly Line at position(23.5, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 for crafting inserters\n- Input burner inserter at position(21.5, 2.5) with coal fuel\n- Output burner inserter at position(25.5, 2.5) with coal fuel\n- Input wooden chest at position(20.5, 2.5) containing 222 inserters and 1 iron plate\n- Output wooden chest at position(26.5, 2.5)\n\n###Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) producing water\n- Boiler at position(-2.5, 24.0) currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine at position(4.5, 24.5) not connected to power network\n- Two pipe networks:\n  - System 33071 (empty) connecting steam engine input\n  - System 33069 (water-filled) connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Electricity network (id 109932) with multiple electric poles\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to missing resources for crafting\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to craft items\n- For iron gear wheels, need iron plates which must be smelted first\n- Cannot craft items that require furnace/machine assembly directly from inventory\n\n### Errors related to inserting items\n- Verify items exist in inventory before attempting to insert them into machines/furnaces\n- Common items that run out: coal, iron ore\n\n### Power system issues\n- Steam engine shows \"not connected to power network\" - ensure proper electrical pole connections\n- Boiler running out of fuel frequently - maintain steady coal supply\n- No fluid in steam connections - verify pipe connections between boiler and steam engine\n\n### Assembly machine issues\n- Machine shows \"not receiving electricity\" - check power pole connections\n- Ingredient shortages - ensure input chest has all required materials (iron plate, iron gear wheel, electronic circuit)\n- Verify inserters can reach both input chest and assembly machine"}
