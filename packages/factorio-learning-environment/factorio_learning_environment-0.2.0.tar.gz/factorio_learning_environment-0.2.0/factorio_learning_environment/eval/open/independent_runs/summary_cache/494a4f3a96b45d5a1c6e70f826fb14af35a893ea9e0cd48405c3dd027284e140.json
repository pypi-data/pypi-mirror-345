{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron and Copper Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Plate Production:**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) supplied with iron ore.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) moving items from a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) to the furnace.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Copper Plate Production:**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) supplied with copper ore.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) moving items from a wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5) to the furnace.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) for storing copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, y=-83.5) and (42.5, y=-83.5) storing coal.\n\n### Transport and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserters at positions (3.5, 0.5), (6.5, 0.5), and (8.5, 0.5) for moving items along the transport belt system.\n- Transport Belt running from position (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and from (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5).\n\n### Storage and Inventory Management\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron and copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from chests\n- Ensure the chest is not empty before attempting to extract items. Check the inventory status of the chest at positions (40.5, y=-83.5) and (41.5, y=-83.5) before extraction attempts.\n\n### Errors when supplying inserters\n- Verify that there is a valid target entity for the inserter to supply. Ensure that a wooden chest is present at the intended drop position, such as at position (9.5, 0.5).\n\n### Errors with transport belt blockages\n- Regularly clear blockages on transport belts, especially at positions like (4.5, 0.5), to maintain efficient item flow.\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Before placing entities like wooden chests, ensure they are available in the inventory to avoid placement failures."}
