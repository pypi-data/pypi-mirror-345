{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-25.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -25.5, 20.0), steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The boiler is currently not connected to any power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position not specified) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine (position not specified).\n- Beltgroup (position not specified) that connects the furnace to the assembling machine.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when removing electricity groups\n- Ensure that the second argument for removing an electricity group is a valid Position object.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes and boilers\n- Verify that there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes between the boiler and offshore pump. Ensure that the positions are clear of other entities.\n\n### Errors when adding fuel to boiler\n- Make sure to be within range of the boiler when attempting to insert coal or any other fuel. Check that the boiler is accessible and not blocked by other entities.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Confirm that the specified position actually contains the entity type you are trying to access. If the entity is not present, adjust the position accordingly.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure that the tile you are trying to place an entity on is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place it."}
