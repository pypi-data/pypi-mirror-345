{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=27.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=1.5, y=27.5) with status: EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=-2.5, y=25.0) with status: EntityStatus.NO_FUEL\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) with status: EntityStatus.WORKING\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities with various pipe positions, including (x=-6.5, y=24.5), (x=-7.5, y=24.5), (x=-4.5, y=25.5), (x=-4.5, y=24.5), and (x=-5.5, y=24.5)\n\n### Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status: EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=13.5) with status: EntityStatus.EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5) with status: EntityStatus.EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=24.5) with status: EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=27.5) with status: EntityStatus.EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=0.5, y=30.5) with status: EntityStatus.EMPTY\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (x=-3.5, y=22.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), etc., with voltage: 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between the boiler and steam engine to establish a connection. The steam engine at position (x=1.5, y=27.5) remains not connected despite multiple attempts to connect using pipes.\n\n### Errors Due to Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Refuel the boiler regularly to ensure it can produce steam. The boiler at position (x=-2.5, y=25.0) is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine Input\n- Verify the steam engine input connection to ensure it receives steam from the boiler. The steam engine at position (x=1.5, y=27.5) is not receiving steam due to connection issues.\n\n### Errors with Furnace No Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) is currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients."}
