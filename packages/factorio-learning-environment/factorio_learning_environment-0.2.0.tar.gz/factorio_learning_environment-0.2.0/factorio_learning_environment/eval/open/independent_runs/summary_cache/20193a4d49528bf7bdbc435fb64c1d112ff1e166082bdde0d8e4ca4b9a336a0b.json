{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) assisting in the transfer process.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring coal to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place an iron chest without having it in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Make sure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting for source items, check the inventory of the source entity to ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Output blocked by item on the ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity (like a chest or belt) to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a non-existent entity\n- Verify the existence and status of the entity before attempting to extract items. For example, ensure the iron chest exists and contains iron ore before extraction."}
