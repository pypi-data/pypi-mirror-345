{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) feeding ore into the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) for storing extracted copper plates.\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnace to the chest and other parts of the facility.\n- Burner Inserters and Transport Belts facilitating movement of materials within the facility.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with fuel but furnace result is full.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnace to other parts of the facility.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) not connected to any fluid system.\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 24.5) not connected to any fluid system.\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 24.5) not connected to any power network.\n\n### Research Lab at Position (-9.5, -39.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (-9.5, -39.5) with automation-science-pack inserted but not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that all necessary items, such as automation-science-packs, offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines, are available in the inventory before attempting to set up or connect structures.\n\n### Errors in Power Setup\n- Ensure that all components of the power generation setup (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are correctly placed and connected. Verify that pipes are properly connecting the boiler to the steam engine to allow fluid transfer.\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Status\n- Regularly check the status of entities like furnaces and inserters to ensure they are not waiting for source items or out of fuel. Address any warnings or errors to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Research Lab Powering\n- Ensure that the research lab is connected to a power source and has the necessary power to function. Check the power network connections to resolve any issues related to the lab's status of \"NO_POWER\"."}
