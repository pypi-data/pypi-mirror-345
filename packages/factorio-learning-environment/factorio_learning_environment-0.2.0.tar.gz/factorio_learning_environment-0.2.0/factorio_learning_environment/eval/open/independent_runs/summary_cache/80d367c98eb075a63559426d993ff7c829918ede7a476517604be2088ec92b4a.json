{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-44.5, -123.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-45.5, -124.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -123.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (8.5, 36.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper plates as output\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with iron plates as output\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no current output\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items from Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) to Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs but currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple pipe groups at various positions, all currently empty and not connected to any fluid source.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. Check the connection between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure there are no gaps or misalignments in the piping.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network. Ensure that the steam engine is receiving steam from the boiler and is connected to the electricity network to distribute power.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the connection between the inserter and the power poles. Ensure that the electricity network is operational and that all poles are connected to a power source.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary raw materials to smelt. Check the input inventories of the furnaces and supply the required resources.\n\n### Lab Not Powered\n- Connect the lab to the electricity network to ensure it receives power for research activities."}
