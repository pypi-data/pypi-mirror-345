{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal and transferring it to nearby chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=42.5, y=-83.5), and (x=41.5, y=-79.5) for coal storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=41.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for transferring coal between chests and the mining drill.\n- **Belt Group** connecting chests at positions (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5) for coal transportation.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore and coal to produce iron plates.\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore and coal to produce iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter contains items to be picked up. This can be resolved by checking the inventory of the source entity and ensuring it is not empty."}
