Currently lacks power connection and inserters.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Electric Mining Drill at `Position(x=19.5, y=73.5)` placed over Iron Ore.\n    *   Stone Furnace at `Position(x=20.0, y=76.0)` intended for smelting.\n    *   Wooden Chest at `Position(x=20.5, y=77.5)` intended for storing output.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Failures\n*   **Connection Errors:** Failed to connect Boiler and Steam Engine multiple times (Steps 1, 2) using `connect_entities`. This indicates the entities were likely placed in positions where direct pipe connections were impossible or blocked. Ensure entities requiring fluid connections (like Boilers and Steam Engines) are placed adjacent or with appropriate spacing for pipe connections. The issue was resolved in Step 4 by picking up and replacing the"}
