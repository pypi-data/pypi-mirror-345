{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and Stone Furnace at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0) for iron smelting.\n- Transport Belt network connecting furnaces to various chests and inserters.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a transport belt network for copper ore transportation.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a transport belt network for iron ore transportation.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) for transferring items from furnace to chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport Systems\n- Various Wooden Chests at positions (x=-20.5, y=-63.5), (x=-13.5, y=-61.5), (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=3.5, y=0.5) for storing different resources.\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various entities for efficient resource transportation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connectivity\n- Ensure continuous placement of transport belts without gaps to maintain connectivity. Verify belt placement at each step to avoid gaps, especially at positions like (x=-21.5, y=-65.5) and (x=-20.5, y=-68.5).\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check the source of items for inserters to ensure they are not left waiting. Verify that the inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) has a valid source of items.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended entity. This will prevent placement errors and improve efficiency."}
