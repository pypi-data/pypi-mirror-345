{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5 y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0 y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=6.5)\n- Connected with pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes from pump to boiler (positions: x=-8.5,y=-0.5; x=-7.5,y=-0.5; x=-6.5,y=0.5; x=-7.5,y=0.5; x=-5.5,y=0.5)\n  - Steam pipes from boiler to engine (positions: x=-3.5,y=3.5; x=-3.5,y=2.5; x=-2.5,y=5.5; x=-3.5,y=5.5; x=-3.5,y=4.5; x=-2.5,y=6.5)\n\n### Stone Mining and Smelting Operation at position (-46.5, 10.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-46.5 y=10.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0 y=14.0)\n- Input inserter (position x=-45.5 y=12.5)\n- Output inserter (position x=-45.5 y=15.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-45.5 y=16.5)\n- Connected with:\n  - Transport belts (positions: x=-46.5 y=12.5; x=-47.5 y=12.5)\n  - Power poles (multiple positions connected to electricity group 3702)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement errors\n- Cannot place entities where other entities already exist (steps 2, 4)\n  - Always check target position is clear before placing new entities\n  - Use the game's collision detection before placement attempts\n\n### Belt and inserter connection issues\n- Transport belts getting blocked (steps 4, 5, 6, 7)\n  - Ensure belt paths are clear before connecting\n  - Verify inserter pickup/drop positions align with belt directions\n  - Check inserter orientations match intended flow direction\n\n### Production chain failures\n- Furnace showing \"no ingredients\" status (steps 6, 7)\n  - Verify belt connections between drill and furnace are complete\n  - Check inserter is correctly positioned between belt and furnace\n  - Ensure furnace has fuel (coal) available\n\n### Power management\n- Entities showing power warnings (step 7)\n  - Verify all production buildings are within power pole coverage\n  - Check power production meets demand (steam engine output)"}
