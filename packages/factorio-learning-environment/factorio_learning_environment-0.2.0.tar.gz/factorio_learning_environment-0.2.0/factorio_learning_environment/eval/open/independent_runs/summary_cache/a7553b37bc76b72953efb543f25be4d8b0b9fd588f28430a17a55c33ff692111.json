{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- **Functionality**: These furnaces are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. They are currently experiencing intermittent issues with ingredient supply and output capacity.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: Working, but with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Positioned at (4.5, -58.5) with iron ore inventory\n  - Additional chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (-14.5, -50.5) for storage purposes.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Chest Capacity Management\n- Ensure that the chests used for storing mined resources have sufficient capacity. Regularly empty or upgrade chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Supply\n- Maintain a consistent supply of ingredients to furnaces. Monitor and manage the inventory of iron ore to ensure continuous production of iron plates.\n\n### Furnace Output Management\n- Regularly extract smelted products from furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Consider setting up automated extraction if possible.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined by the agent.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n  - `wooden-chest`: int\n\nThe agent should focus on improving resource management and automation to enhance production efficiency and reduce manual intervention."}
