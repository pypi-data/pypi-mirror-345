{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-9.5, y=-48.5) that feeds into the stone furnace\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-52.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-15.5, y=-53.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities, with belts positioned from (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing wooden chests\n- Ensure there is a suitable, unoccupied position before attempting to place a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a stone furnace\n- Use an inserter to connect belts from a stone furnace, as belts cannot be connected directly.\n\n### Insufficient coal to refuel all inserters\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal to ensure all inserters are refueled and operational.\n\n### No iron plates found in the furnace\n- Investigate the supply chain to ensure raw materials are being delivered to the furnace for smelting."}
