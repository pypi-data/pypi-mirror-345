{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-23, -66)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25, -64) connected to a transport belt system leading to a Stone Furnace at position (-23, -66).\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-23, -66) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage Facility at Position (-14.5, -54.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14, -53) extracting iron ore and depositing it into a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53, -83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53, -83) extracting coal and depositing it into a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Additional Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19, -65)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19, -65) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) transferring items between a Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) and the Stone Furnace.\n\n### Idle Furnace at Position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0, 0) currently not processing due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Empty Wooden Chest at Position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) with no current inventory.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items to transfer to the Wooden Chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that there are source items available for inserters to pick up. Check the supply chain to ensure that resources are being delivered to the inserters.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Blocked by Items on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity available to accept the output from inserters. Check the destination entity to ensure it is not full or blocked.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply chain to ensure that resources are being delivered to the furnaces."}
