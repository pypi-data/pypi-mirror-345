{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, y=-58.5) and (5.5, y=-60.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) used for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Each furnace has a fuel inventory containing coal and is currently working.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), (-12.5, y=-50.5), (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), (-8.5, y=-50.5), (-7.5, y=-50.5), and (-6.5, y=-50.5) used for storing iron plates. Some chests have warnings indicating they are full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining and production stoppages due to full inventory warnings.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- Regularly check and clear the output chests of mining drills to ensure continuous operation and prevent warnings about full drop positions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count`: int, tracks the amount of iron ore in the inventory.\n- `iron_plate_count`: int, tracks the amount of iron plates in the inventory.\n- `coal_count`: int, tracks the amount of coal in the inventory."}
