{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5), boiler (position not specified), and offshore pump (position not specified). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Electric poles around the steam engine\nConsists of small electric poles (position 51.5, 51.5) which are intended to connect the steam engine to the power network but cannot be placed due to existing objects in the way.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing objects that may block the placement.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Verify that the steam engine is ready to accept coal and that it has space available. If the engine is full or not accepting the item, consider checking its status and ensuring it is connected properly.\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are properly defined before using them in functions. Double-check the scope of your variables to avoid NameErrors.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The failure to insert coal into the steam engine has been logged multiple times. Review the configuration and connection of the steam engine to ensure it is set up correctly to accept fuel."}
