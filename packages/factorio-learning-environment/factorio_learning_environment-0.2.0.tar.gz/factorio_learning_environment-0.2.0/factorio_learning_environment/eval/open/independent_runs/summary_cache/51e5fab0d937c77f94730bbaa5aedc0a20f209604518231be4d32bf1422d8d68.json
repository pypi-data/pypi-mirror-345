{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently out of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Coal Supply System at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is operational and currently refueled with coal.\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which contains coal but is nearing full capacity.\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- The agent has been harvesting iron ore from this position.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when the wooden chest is full**\n  - The burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) has issued a warning that the chest at (41.5, -80.5) is full. Ensure to empty the chest regularly to avoid halting mining operations.\n\n- **Errors when furnace has no ingredients**\n  - The furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) has reported no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that there are sufficient iron ore and fuel (coal) available in the furnace to maintain smelting operations.\n\n- **Errors when extracting from the furnace**\n  - Ensure that the furnace has produced items before attempting to extract them. The furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) had an empty inventory at one point.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus"}
