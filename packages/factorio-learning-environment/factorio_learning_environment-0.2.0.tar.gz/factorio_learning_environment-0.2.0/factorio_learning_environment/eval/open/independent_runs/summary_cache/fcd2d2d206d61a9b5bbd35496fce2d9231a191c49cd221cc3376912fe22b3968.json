{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Plate Production at position (52.0, -80.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (52.0, -80.0) and a burner inserter at position (53.5, -78.5) that is connected to the furnace. The furnace is fueled by coal and produces iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at position (62.0, -54.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (62.0, -54.0) that is fueled by coal and produces iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transportation at position (51.5, -84.5)\nConsists of a belt group that transports coal from position (51.5, -84.5) to position (53.5, -78.5) and then to the furnace at position (52.0, -80.0).\n\n### Storage at position (52.5, -82.5)\nConsists of a wooden chest at position (52.5, -82.5) that can be used to store items.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Make sure the furnace has produced the item before attempting to extract it.\n- Ensure the furnace has enough fuel to produce the item.\n\n### Errors when using burner inserters\n- Make sure the inserter has a valid source and destination position.\n- Ensure the inserter has enough fuel to operate.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* `extract_item`: a function that extracts items from entities. It has been invoked multiple times but has failed due to the furnace not producing the item.\n* `furnace1`: a variable that refers to a stone furnace entity. It has been used to extract iron plates.\n* `Prototype.IronPlate`: a variable that refers to the iron plate item prototype.\n* `quantity`: a variable that refers to the quantity of items to extract. It has been set to different values (1, 2, 3) but has failed due to the furnace not producing the item."}
