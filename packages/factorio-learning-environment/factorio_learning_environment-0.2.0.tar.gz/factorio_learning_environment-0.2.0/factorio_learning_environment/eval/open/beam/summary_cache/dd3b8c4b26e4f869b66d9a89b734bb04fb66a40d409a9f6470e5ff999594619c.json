This suggests that the crafting recipe for the stone furnace requires stone, which I currently do not have in my inventory.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- The previous furnace has been dismantled successfully.\n- I have 2 pieces of copper ore and 3 iron plates in my inventory.\n- The crafting attempt for a new stone furnace failed due to a lack of stone.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Gather Stone**: I will need to gather some stone from the environment to be able to craft the new furnace.\n2. **Re-attempt Crafting**: Once I have collected enough stone, I can try crafting the stone furnace again.\n3. **Place the New Furnace**: After crafting, I will place the new furnace and insert the copper ore for processing.\n\nLet\u2019s start by gathering stone from the nearby resources.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Gather stone from the environment\ngather_resource(Prototype.Stone, quantity=5)  # Assume I need at least 5 stones to craft a new furnace\n\n# Check the inventory after gathering stone\nprint(f\"Current inventory after gathering stone: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check the overall inventory again.", "summary_range": "[1-102]"}
