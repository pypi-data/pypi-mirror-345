The error \"NameError: name 'Chest' is not defined\" suggests that the 'Chest' entity was not recognized. Verify that the correct module or class is imported and used.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing"}
