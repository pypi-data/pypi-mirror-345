These removals have left the mining operation with only the mining drill remaining on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 WoodenChest Placement \u2013 Extended Search Failures and Obstructed Zones  \n\u2003\u2013 Repeated extended search attempts (with parameters up to max_attempts=100 and step=0.5) failed to secure a free buildable area for WoodenChest. Adjust candidate reference positions further from cluttered zones and inspect the area manually before automated clearance.\n\n\u2022 Risky Automated Clearance Operations  \n\u2003\u2013 Automated clearance procedures have resulted in the removal of essential structure components (e.g. the wooden chest and associated belt groups from the Iron Ore Mining Operation). Verify the importance of nearby entities before removal to prevent accidental deconstruction of established structures.\n\n\u2022 Inconsistent Candidate Zone Selection  \n\u2003\u2013 Multiple candidate positions (such as (-17.5, -43.5), (-5.5, -49.5), (-0.5, -47.5), and (1.5, -47.5)) have repeatedly been identified as obstructed. Refine the obstruction detection and candidate zone selection algorithm to clearly distinguish between non\u2010critical clutter and key structural components.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nget_connection_amount(boiler: Entity, extra_se: Entity, connection_type: Prototype) -> int  \n\u2003\u2013 Determines the required number of pipes to connect two entities; raises an exception if connectivity or spatial conditions are not met.\n\nplace_entity(entity_type: Prototype, position: Position, direction: Direction) -> Entity  \n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place an entity of the specified type at the given position and orientation; fails if the tile is occupied or if the necessary item is absent from inventory.\n\ncraft_item(item: Prototype, quantity: int) -> int  \n\u2003\u2013 Initiates crafting for a specified item and quantity; throws an exception if essential sub-ingredients or an operational production/smelting facility is missing.\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 inventory: dict[str, int] \u2014 Represents the current inventory.\n\u2022 boiler: Entity \u2014 Refers to the boiler at (8.0, 20.5).\n\u2022 extra_se: Entity \u2014 Denotes the extra steam engine at (11.5, 18.5).\n\u2022 new_buildable_area: BuildableArea \u2014 Utility used to determine available buildable regions."}
