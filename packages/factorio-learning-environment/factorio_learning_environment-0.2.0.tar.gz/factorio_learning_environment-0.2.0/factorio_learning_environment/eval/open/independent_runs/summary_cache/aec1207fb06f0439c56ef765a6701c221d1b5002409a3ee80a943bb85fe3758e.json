{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) with a burner inserter at position (x=62.5, y=-53.5) for inserting iron ore.\n- Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0) with a burner inserter at position (x=65.5, y=-52.5) for inserting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) for storing intermediate materials.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple belt groups:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions with belts, primarily used for transporting materials between different production facilities. Notably, there are belts connecting from (x=43.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.0, y=-51.0) and (x=66.0, y=-51.0), although these connections are currently facing issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts\n- Ensure that the path for connecting belts is valid and unobstructed. The repeated failure to connect belts from (x=43.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.0, y=-51.0) and (x=66.0, y=-51.0) indicates a pathing issue that needs resolution.\n\n### Errors with Item Insertion\n- Ensure that the target inventory has space and is compatible with the item being inserted. The repeated error \"Could not insert: LuaItemStack\" suggests that the target inventory may be full or incompatible with the item type.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used for inserting items into entities. Failed due to incompatible or full inventories.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace_1`: Represents a furnace entity used in item insertion operations.\n- `Prototype.IronOre`: Represents the iron ore item type used in insertion operations."}
