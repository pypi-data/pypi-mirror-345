This was encountered when trying to place a pipe at Position (-45.5, -123.5).\n\n### Boiler not receiving water\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. The boiler at Position (-44.5, -123.0) is not receiving water, as indicated by the warning \"no input liquid\".\n\n### Entities not receiving power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional power network. The inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) and the lab are not receiving power."}
