{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Boiler** at position (x=0.5, y=23.0) with status `NO_FUEL`, connected to:\n  - **Pipe** at position (x=0.5, y=21.5)\n  - **Pipe-to-ground** at position (x=2.5, y=21.5)\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=7.5, y=23.5) with status `NOT_CONNECTED`, connected to:\n  - **Pipe-to-ground** at position (x=5.5, y=20.5)\n  - **Pipe** at position (x=7.5, y=20.5)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status `WORKING`, connected to:\n  - **Pipe** at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n  - **Pipe** at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- **PipeGroup** at fluid system 33805, starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status `FULL_OUTPUT`, transporting water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles at various positions including (x=33.5, y=24.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), voltage 0.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that the connection points are not obstructed or misaligned.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Ensure that the boiler has sufficient fuel by checking inventory levels before attempting to insert fuel. Maintain a steady supply of coal to prevent the boiler from running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors in Electrical Connections\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network. Check that all necessary connections are established and that there are no missing or misaligned poles.\n\n### Errors in Resource Availability\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required resources are available in the inventory to prevent errors related to missing resources.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item(item: Prototype, entity, quantity: int)`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into an entity. Failure occurs if the item is not available in the inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `boiler`: Represents the boiler entity, currently at position (x=0.5, y=23.0).\n  - `offshore_pump`: Represents the offshore pump entity, currently at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5).\n  - `steam_engine`: Represents the steam engine entity, currently at position (x=7.5, y=23.5).\n  - `coal`: Integer representing the quantity of coal available in the inventory."}
