{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5): Used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at Position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at Position (-10.0, -48.0): Additional furnace for smelting, currently without ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserters** at Positions (-11.5, -46.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5): Facilitate the movement of materials between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions: Store iron plates and other resources.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., furnace) has the specified items available before attempting to extract. This will prevent extraction errors.\n\n#### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Regularly check and clear any blockages at inserter drop positions to maintain smooth operation. Ensure there is enough space for inserters to drop items.\n\n#### Errors when Using Extract Functions\n- Verify that the extraction function parameters, such as quantity and target entity, are correctly specified and that the entity has the required items available for extraction.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. This can be resolved by maintaining a steady supply of raw materials and clearing any blockages."}
