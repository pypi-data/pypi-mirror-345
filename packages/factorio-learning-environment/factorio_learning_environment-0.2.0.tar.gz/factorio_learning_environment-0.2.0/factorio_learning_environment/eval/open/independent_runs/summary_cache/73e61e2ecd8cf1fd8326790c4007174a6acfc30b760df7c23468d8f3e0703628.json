{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore and processed iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring items between chests and the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or empty chests\n- Ensure the chest contains the items you are trying to extract before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Confirm the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing or direction if the tile is occupied.\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to existing entities\n- Verify that there is enough space and no obstruction from other entities when placing new entities adjacent to existing ones. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position as needed."}
