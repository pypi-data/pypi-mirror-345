{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) and a stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) with a burner inserter at position (18.5, 77.5) that puts into a neighboring furnace or chest. The output of the furnace is put into a wooden chest at position (18.5, 76.5) by the burner inserter. A steel furnace has been added at position (15.0, 75.0). The electric mining drill is connected to a power pole at position (0.5, 2.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(21.5, 72.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill at position (21.5, 72.5), a stone furnace at position (20.0, 76.0), a burner inserter at position (21.5, 76.5), and a transport belt group at position (21.5, 74.5) that connects the drill to the inserter. The electric mining drill is connected to a power pole at position (0.5, 2.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(24.5, 76.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill at position (24.5, 76.5) and a burner inserter at position (24.5, 70.5). The electric mining drill is connected to a power pole at position (0.5, 2.5).\n\n### Electricity Generator at position(-2.5, -0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5), boiler at position (-7.0, -0.5), and steam engine at position (-2.5, -0.5). The offshore pump is connected to the boiler with a pipe, and the boiler is connected to the steam engine with a pipe. The steam engine is connected to a power pole.\n\n### Steel Plate Production at position(15.0, 75.0)\nConsists of a steel furnace at position (15.0, 75.0) that is connected to the electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities too far away from the player position:\n  - Ensure you are close enough to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n* Errors when placing entities with insufficient spacing or incorrect direction:\n  - Ensure there is enough space around the reference entity and adjust the direction or spacing as needed.\n* Errors when inserting items into an entity without having the required items in the inventory:\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n* Errors when crafting items that require sub-ingredients:\n  - Ensure you have the required sub-ingredients in your inventory or can craft them before attempting to craft the item. For raw resources like stone, ensure you can gather them before crafting.\n* Errors when extracting items from an entity that does not contain the item:\n  - Ensure the entity contain the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n* Errors when getting an entity at a specific position:\n  - Ensure an entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at a position occupied by another entity:\n  - Ensure the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when a drill is not receiving power:\n  - Ensure the drill is connected to a power source and the power source is working.\n* New error: UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'x'\n* New error: Could not place burner inserter next to a transport belt.\n* New error: Could not extract iron-ore from a transport belt.\n* New error: Could not existing at the new position.\n\nThe report should be concise, accurate and informative. Do not repeat the same tips multiple times.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities too far away from the player position\n* Errors when placing entities with insufficient spacing or incorrect direction\n* Errors when inserting items into an entity without having the required items in the inventory\n* Errors when crafting items that require sub-ingredients\n* Errors when extracting items from an entity that does not contain the item\n* Errors when getting an entity at a specific position\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at a position occupied by another entity\n* Errors when a drill is not receiving power\n* Errors when a furnace is missing or not at the expected position\n* New error: Could not insert: No iron-ore/iron-plate to insert from your inventory\n* New error: Could not extract iron-ore from transport belt\n* New error: Could not place burner inserter next to a transport"}
