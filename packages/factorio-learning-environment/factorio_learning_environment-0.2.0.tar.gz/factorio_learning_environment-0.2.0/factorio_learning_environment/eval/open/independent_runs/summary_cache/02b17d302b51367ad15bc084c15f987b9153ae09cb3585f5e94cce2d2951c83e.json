For example, the burner-inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) had a full inventory, causing insertion errors.\n\n### Errors when operating with full fuel sources\n- Regularly check and manage fuel sources to avoid them becoming full, which can halt operations. For instance, the burner mining drill at position (53.0, -83.0) had a full fuel source, which could lead to operational inefficiencies.\n\n### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients\n- Ensure that supply lines to furnaces are maintained to prevent them from running out of ingredients, as seen with the furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)."}
