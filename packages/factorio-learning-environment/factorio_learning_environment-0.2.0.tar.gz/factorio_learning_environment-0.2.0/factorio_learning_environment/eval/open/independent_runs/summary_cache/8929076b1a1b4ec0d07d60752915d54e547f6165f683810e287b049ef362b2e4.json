{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mine at position(40.5, -82.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- None (no structures have been built yet)\n\n### Iron Ore location at position(2.5, -73.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- None (no structures have been built yet)\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(3.5, -63.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 4.0, -63.0) with current fuel of 8 coal and 6 iron ore available for smelting, producing 11 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. In this case, you need a stone furnace to place it at the specified location.\n- Check the recipe requirements for crafting entities to ensure you have the necessary materials available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when crafting due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure you gather the required amount of raw resources before attempting to craft items. In the case of the stone furnace, ensure you have at least 2 stone before crafting.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into an entity\n- Ensure the second argument in the insert_item function is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Verify that you are passing the correct entity reference when attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors related to smelting timeout\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has both fuel and ingredients to smelt. Check the inventory for required inputs and ensure they are available before starting the smelting process. This error occurred due to insufficient iron ore in inventory.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient ingredients in the furnace\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. If the furnace is empty of ingredients, it will not be able to produce items."}
