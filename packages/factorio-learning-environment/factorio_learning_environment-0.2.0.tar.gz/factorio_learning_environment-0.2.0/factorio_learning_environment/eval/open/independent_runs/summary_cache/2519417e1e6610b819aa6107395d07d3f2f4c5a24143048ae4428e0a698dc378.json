Earlier attempts referenced IDs [18684, 18727, 18770, 18813, 18856, 18899, 18942, 18985] while the latest steps attempted IDs [19028, 19071, 19114, 19157, 19200, 19243, 19286, 19329]. Validate the existence and working status of the PipeGroup before connection and consistently use the current operational fluid_system ID (currently 19372).\n\u2022 Pipeline Stabilization Efficiency:\n   - Fixed delay intervals (10-second waits) reduce operational efficiency. Implement dynamic status checks after connection attempts to ensure the pipeline is stabilized before proceeding."}
