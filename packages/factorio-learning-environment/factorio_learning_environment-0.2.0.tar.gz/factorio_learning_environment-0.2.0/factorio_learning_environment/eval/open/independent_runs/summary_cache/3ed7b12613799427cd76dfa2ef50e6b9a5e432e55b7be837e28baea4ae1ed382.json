{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution logs. The entity placement attempts have all resulted in errors, and thus, no structures are present to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before attempting to place an entity. The agent attempted to place entities such as Wooden Chests and Stone Furnaces at various positions (e.g., x=0.0 y=10.0, x=10.0 y=0.0, x=0.0 y=0.0, x=50.0 y=50.0) but encountered errors because the positions were not clear for placement.\n- Verify the placement position is within valid bounds and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features. The agent attempted to place a Burner Inserter at x=-100.0 y=100.0, which may be outside the accessible area or obstructed.\n\n### General Placement Tips\n- Before placing any entity, check the surrounding area to ensure there is enough space and no obstructions. This will help in avoiding placement errors and ensure the efficient use of resources.\n- Consider using the map view or a planning tool to visualize the layout and ensure that the intended positions for entities are clear and accessible."}
