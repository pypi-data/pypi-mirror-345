{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drills**:\n  - Position (x=41.0, y=-86.0) - Mining coal, out of fuel.\n  - Position (x=43.0, y=-86.0) - Mining coal, out of fuel, chest at drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Position (x=43.5, y=-84.5) - Contains 358 coal.\n  - Position (x=41.5, y=-82.5) - Contains 727 coal.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) - Transfers coal from belt to chest.\n  - Position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) - Transfers coal to furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace**:\n  - Position (x=43.0, y=-79.0) - No ingredients to smelt.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drills**:\n  - Position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) - Mining iron ore, out of fuel, chest at drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Position (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) - Contains 58 iron ore.\n  - Position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) - Empty.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Position (x=-14.5, y=-52.5) - Transfers iron ore to furnace.\n  - Position (x=-17.5, y=-50.5) - Transfers iron ore to chest.\n  - Position (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) - Transfers coal to furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) - No ingredients to smelt.\n  - Position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0) - No ingredients to smelt.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is empty before placing an entity. Use `get_entity` to check if a tile is occupied before placing.\n- Example: Placing a burner inserter at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) failed because another inserter already existed there.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Ensure the source and target entities are correctly positioned and aligned before attempting to connect them with belts.\n- Example: Failed to connect burner inserter at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to itself due to misalignment.\n\n#### Errors when retrieving entities that do not exist\n- Always verify the existence of an entity at a position using `get_entity` before performing operations on it.\n- Example: Attempting to retrieve a wooden chest at (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) failed because no chest existed there.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to occupied positions\n- Increase spacing or change the direction when placing entities next to occupied positions.\n- Example: Placing a wooden chest next to (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) failed because a chest already existed at the target position.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills run out of fuel or chests are full\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and empty chests to ensure continuous operation.\n- Example: Mining drills at (x=41.0, y=-86.0) and (x=43.0, y=-86.0) stopped due to lack of fuel and full chests.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces lack ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials and fuel.\n- Example: Furnaces at (x=43.0, y=-79.0) and (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) stopped due to lack of ingredients."}
