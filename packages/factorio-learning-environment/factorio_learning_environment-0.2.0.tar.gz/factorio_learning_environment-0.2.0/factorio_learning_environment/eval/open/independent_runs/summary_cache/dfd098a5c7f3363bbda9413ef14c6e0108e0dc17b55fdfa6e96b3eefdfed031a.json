{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n#### Inserter Setup at Position (-15.5, -44.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-15.5, -44.5) for transferring items.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-13.5, -44.5) for transferring items.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing wooden chest in non-buildable areas\n- Ensure the target position is buildable before attempting to place a wooden chest. Use the `is_buildable` API to verify the tile.\n\n#### Errors with inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has a valid source of items to pick up. Place a chest or other source entity in the inserter's pickup position.\n\n#### Repeated attempts to place chests in the same non-buildable positions\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to place chests in the same non-buildable positions. Move to a different location or verify the buildable status of the tile before attempting placement.\n\n#### Errors with burner mining drill out of fuel\n- Ensure the burner mining drill has sufficient fuel to operate. Insert coal or other fuel sources into the drill to keep it running."}
