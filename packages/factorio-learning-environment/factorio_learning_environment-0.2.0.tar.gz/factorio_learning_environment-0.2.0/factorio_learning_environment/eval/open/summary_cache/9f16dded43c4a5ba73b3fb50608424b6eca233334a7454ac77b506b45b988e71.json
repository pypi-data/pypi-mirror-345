{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore but frequently full on output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), fueled and operational, moving iron plates into chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace remains unresolved, causing mining drill to wait for space.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with stable power and inserter fueling, though output congestion persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5), fueled intermittently, currently out of fuel at last report.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5), generating power and connected to boiler by pipes.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5) and (17.5, 72.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power but requires consistent fueling of the boiler to maintain operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and operational, receiving iron plates directly inserted into input chest at (21.5, 75.5).\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) connected to output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), both fueled and operational.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and moving items.\n- Assembling machine input and output inventories show active presence of iron plates and iron gear wheels, indicating ongoing production.\n- Output chest remains empty, suggesting output items are not being extracted or transferred further.\n\nThis structure is fully powered and supplied with iron plates, producing iron gear wheels continuously, but lacks output logistics to move finished products away.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace output belt\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked due to the furnace output belt being full or congested.\n- The furnace output inventory frequently fills up, preventing further smelting and causing upstream mining drill stoppage.\n- To resolve, extend or clear output belts and ensure downstream chests or inserters have capacity to accept iron plates.\n- Consider adding more storage or faster inserters to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Boiler fueling inconsistency causing power interruptions\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) was observed out of fuel, causing steam engine to stop generating power temporarily.\n- Maintain consistent coal insertion into boiler to ensure continuous steam production and stable power output.\n- Automate fuel supply to boiler or monitor fuel levels closely.\n\n### Electric pole placement conflicts\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near (18.0, 75.0) repeatedly failed due to collisions with existing entities like mining drills or water tiles.\n- To avoid placement errors, verify tile occupancy and adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions before placing poles.\n- Utilize alternative nearby free tiles to maintain power network connectivity.\n\n### Output logistics missing for assembling machine\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) produces iron gear wheels, but output chest at (25.5, 82.5) remains empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) is fueled but waiting for source items, indicating no extraction from output chest.\n- Implement inserters or belts to move finished products from output chest to further storage or transport systems.\n- Monitor output inventories to ensure smooth product flow and prevent production halts.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and operational.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel and source/destination inventories to"}
