{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) and (62.5, -53.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) for additional coal storage.\n\n### Coal Mining and Handling Facility at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) and (42.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) for transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserter is waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity contains items before the inserter attempts to pick up items. This can be achieved by monitoring the source entity's inventory and ensuring it is not empty.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Always check the fuel levels of entities like burner mining drills and inserters to ensure they have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly refuel them to prevent operational downtime.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the agent's current inventory of items like wood, coal, and iron plates.\n- `furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of the stone furnace, specifically the amounts of iron ore and iron plates.\n- `entity_positions`: List[Tuple[str, Position]] - Tracks the positions and types of entities on the map."}
