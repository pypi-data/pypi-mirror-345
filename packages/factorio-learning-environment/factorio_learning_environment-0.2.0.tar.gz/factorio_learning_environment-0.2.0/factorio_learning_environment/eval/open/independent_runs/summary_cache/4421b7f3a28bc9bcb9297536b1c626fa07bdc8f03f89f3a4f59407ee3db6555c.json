{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by a network of pipes and small electric poles\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) supplied with copper ore\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -82.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -82.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for storage\n\n### Coal Extraction and Distribution\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) storing coal\n- BeltGroup transporting coal from position (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates and coal\n\n### Incomplete Lab Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, but currently without power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Accessing Non-existent Entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not get Prototype.Lab at position x=0.0 y=0.0\".\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Double-check the spelling and case of entity names in the code. Use the correct name, such as 'lab (entities.Lab)', to avoid NameError exceptions.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing entities."}
