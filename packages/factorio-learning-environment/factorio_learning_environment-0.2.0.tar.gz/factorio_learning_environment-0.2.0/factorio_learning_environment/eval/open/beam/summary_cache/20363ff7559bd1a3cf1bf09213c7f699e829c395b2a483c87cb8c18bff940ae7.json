{"content": "The attempt to craft copper cables has failed because the recipe requires a specific crafting or smelting machine to produce them. This indicates that the copper cables cannot be crafted directly in the inventory but must be made in a designated assembly machine or crafting station.\n\n### Current Insights:\n1. **Copper Cables**: They cannot be crafted directly from the inventory; I need to use an assembly machine or a similar crafting station.\n2. **Copper Plates**: I have enough copper plates, but without the proper machine, I cannot proceed with crafting the cables.\n\n### Current Inventory:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces (still available)\n- 3 pieces of coal (fuel remaining)\n- 3 pieces of iron plates (produced previously)\n- **5 pieces of copper plates** (currently processed)\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Craft an Assembly Machine**: I will need to craft an assembly machine to be able to produce copper cables and subsequently electronic circuits.\n2. **Gather Resources for Assembly Machine**: If I don\u2019t have enough resources to craft an assembly machine, I will need to gather those resources.\n\nLet\u2019s check if I can craft an assembly machine and what resources are required for it.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the recipe for the assembly machine to see what resources are needed\nassembly_machine_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.AssemblyMachine1)\nprint(f\"Recipe for Assembly Machine 1: {assembly_machine_recipe}\")\n\n# Check current inventory to see if I can craft the assembly machine\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Determine if I can craft the assembly machine\nrequired_resources = assembly_machine_recipe.ingredients\ncan_craft = all(current_inventory.get(item.name, 0) >= item.count for item in required_resources)\n\nif can_craft:\n    # Craft the assembly machine\n    craft_item(Prototype.AssemblyMachine1)\nelse:\n    print(\"Insufficient resources to craft Assembly Machine.\")\n\n# Check the inventory after attempting to craft the assembly machine\nprint(f\"Inventory after attempting to craft assembly machine: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check the updated inventory now.", "summary_range": "[1-126]"}
