{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Research Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to power supply and currently working on Logistics research.\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5) with status EntityStatus.EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with fluid 'water' and status EntityStatus.WORKING.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-1.5, y=22.5) with fluid 'steam' and status EntityStatus.WORKING.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions [(x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5)] and voltage 68033.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Research Setup\n- Ensure that the research prerequisites are met before attempting to set a research topic. The lab must have the required science packs and the research tree should allow the selected research.\n\n### Errors with Lab Connection\n- Verify that the lab is properly connected to the power supply and has the necessary science packs inserted. Ensure that the lab status is not 'NO_RESEARCH_IN_PROGRESS' by selecting an available research.\n\n### Errors when Refueling Boiler\n- Maintain sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel the boiler. Regularly check the fuel levels and replenish coal to avoid power interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement and Connection\n- Ensure that all entities like the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine are correctly connected with pipes and power poles to ensure seamless operation."}
