Attempt to clear any potential obstructions before placing.\n- Verify that the position is suitable for placing the boiler by checking for existing objects in the way.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Check for existing entities occupying the target tile."}
