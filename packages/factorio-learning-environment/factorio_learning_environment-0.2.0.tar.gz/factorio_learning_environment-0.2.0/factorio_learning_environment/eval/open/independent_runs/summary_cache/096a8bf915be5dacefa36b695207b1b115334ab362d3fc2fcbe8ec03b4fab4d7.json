{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting these entities with fluid system ID 103\n\n### Research Facility at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5) with input for 'automation-science-pack'\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for loading science packs into the lab\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for power distribution\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Stone Furnace Setup at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with fuel inventory\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items in and out of the furnace\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### NameError: Undefined Entity 'Lab'\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly imported or defined before usage. Consider checking for typos or missing imports for the 'Lab' entity.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that all inserters are connected to a powered electric pole. Ensure that the electricity network is properly set up and that the poles are connected to a power source.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers to ensure continuous operation. Consider setting up automated refueling systems if possible.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the electricity network. Check for any missing connections or misaligned poles.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Make sure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned and operational to feed the furnace.\n\n### Lab No Power\n- Confirm that the lab is connected to a power source and that the electricity network is operational. Check for any disconnections or power shortages."}
