{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59) smelting copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -59.5) moving ore from drill to furnace\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) for output\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates from furnace to chest\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10, -59), (-8, -59), and (-6, -59) mining iron ore\n- Three wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\nEach chest contains approximately 175 iron ore\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n- Four input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) containing coal\n- Four output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5) containing iron plates\n- Eight burner inserters:\n  - Four at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) for input\n  - Four at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5) for output\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Placement and Operation Issues\n- When an inserter shows \"output blocked by item on ground\", ensure there is a valid destination entity (like a chest or furnace) at the drop position\n- When replacing problematic inserters, make sure to properly configure their pickup and drop positions\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices - some mining drills only have 3 coal remaining\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ingredients to operate efficiently - several furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n\n### Entity Spacing\n- When building production lines, maintain proper spacing between entities to allow for inserter operation and item movement\n- Verify that inserters can reach both their pickup and drop positions before finalizing placement"}
