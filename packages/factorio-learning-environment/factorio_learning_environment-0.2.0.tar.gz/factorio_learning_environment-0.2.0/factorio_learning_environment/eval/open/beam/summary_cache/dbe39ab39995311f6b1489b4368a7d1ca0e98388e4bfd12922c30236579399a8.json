{"content": "Ah, I see the issue now. We need to craft the burner mining drill first! Let's do this step by step:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\nprint(f\"Starting inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Craft iron gear wheels first (needed for burner mining drill)\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=5)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting gears: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Now craft the burner mining drill\nrecipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, quantity=1)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting drill: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Find nearest iron ore\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# Now place the mining drill\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=iron_pos,\n    direction=Direction.DOWN\n)\n\nif drill:\n    # Add fuel to drill\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=10)\n    print(f\"Placed and fueled drill at: {drill.position}\")\n    \n    # We already have transport belts, so place one at drill's output\n    belt = place_entity(\n        Prototype.TransportBelt,\n        position=drill.drop_position,\n        direction=Direction.DOWN\n    )\n    \n    if belt:\n        print(f\"Placed transport belt at: {belt.position}\")\n        \n        # Place furnace at end of belt\n        furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n            Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n            reference_position=belt.position,\n            direction=Direction.DOWN,\n            spacing=1\n        )\n        \n        if furnace:\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=10)\n            print(f\"Placed and fueled furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Final entities: {get_entities()}\")\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should work better because:\n1. We craft the iron gear wheels first\n2. Then craft the burner mining drill\n3. Then place everything in sequence\n4. We already have transport belts in inventory\n5. We have stone furnaces available\n\nThe key was realizing we needed to craft the burner mining drill before trying to place it!", "summary_range": "[1-256]"}
