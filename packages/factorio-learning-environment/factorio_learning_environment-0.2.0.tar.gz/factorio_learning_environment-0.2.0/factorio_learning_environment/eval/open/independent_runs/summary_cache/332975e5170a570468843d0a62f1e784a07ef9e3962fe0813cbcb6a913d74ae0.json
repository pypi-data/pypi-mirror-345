{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler and steam engine:\n  - Water pipes from positions (-9.0, 24.5) to (-3.0, 24.5)\n  - Steam pipes from positions (-2.5, 24.0) to (-2.5, 20.0)\n- Pipe group at position (-4.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity group at position (-5.4, 20.0)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors Between Entities\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that there are no obstructions and that the pipes are placed in the correct positions.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Always check that the boiler has sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly insert coal or other fuel sources to keep the boiler running.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to place an entity, ensure that you have the required items in your inventory. For example, make sure you have small electric poles before attempting to place them.\n\n### Electric Network Connection\n- Verify that all components requiring electricity are connected to the electric network. Place small electric poles strategically to ensure all entities are plugged in.\n\n### Ingredient Supply for Stone Furnace\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate. Regularly supply it with the required materials to maintain production efficiency."}
