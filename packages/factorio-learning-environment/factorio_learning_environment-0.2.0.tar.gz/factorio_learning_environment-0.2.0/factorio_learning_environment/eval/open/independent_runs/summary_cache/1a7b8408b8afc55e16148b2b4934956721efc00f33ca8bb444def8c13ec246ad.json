{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron and Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) refueled and operational, connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) with coal inventory.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) with coal and iron plate inventory.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) with coal inventory.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5), (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=11.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=7.5, y=0.5) with iron and copper plates, and at (x=12.5, y=0.5) with copper plates.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting various stages of processing:\n  - Belt from (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=4.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=41.5, y=-83.5), and (x=42.5, y=-83.5) storing coal.\n- **Transport Belt** from (x=40.5, y=-83.5) to (x=38.5, y=-83.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from chests\n- Ensure the chest is not empty before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly check and manage inventory space to avoid extraction and harvesting errors.\n\n### Errors when inserters are blocked\n- Clear blockages from inserters to ensure smooth operation. Check for full chests or missing source items.\n\n### Errors when refueling or transferring items\n- Verify that the target chest or entity has enough space to receive the transferred items."}
