{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities for water and steam transfer\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a drop position at (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items from a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) to the Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs and no research in progress\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple PipeGroups exist, facilitating fluid transfer across various positions:\n- Water PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -122.5)\n- Steam PipeGroup at Position (-46.5, -120.5)\n- Several other empty PipeGroups at various positions\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles distributed across the map, connecting various entities to the power grid\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities without Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a wooden chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) failed due to lack of a wooden chest in inventory.\n\n### Errors when Output is Blocked\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or storage available to accept the output from production entities like drills to prevent blockage. For instance, the burner mining drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) is blocked due to no sink entity.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
