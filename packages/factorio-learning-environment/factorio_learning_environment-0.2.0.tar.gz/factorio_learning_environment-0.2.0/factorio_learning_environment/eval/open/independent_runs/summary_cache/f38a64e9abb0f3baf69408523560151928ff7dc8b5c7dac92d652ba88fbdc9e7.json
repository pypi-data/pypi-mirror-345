{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these components\n\n#### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Burner Inserters and Stone Furnaces positioned around (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Transport Belts connecting furnaces to inserters and chests\n- Wooden Chests at positions like (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5)\n- Iron Chest at Position (-11.5, -44.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Incorrect Use of Class Attributes\n- Ensure that you are accessing attributes of an object correctly. For example, use `entities.BurnerInserter` instead of trying to access `BurnerInserter` directly from a list.\n\n#### Undefined Name Errors\n- Always import or define the necessary classes and objects before using them. For example, ensure `BurnerInserter` is defined or imported as `entities.BurnerInserter` before use.\n\n#### Extraction Errors Due to Missing Items\n- Before attempting to extract items from a chest, verify that the chest contains the required items. This can be done by checking the inventory of the chest.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned and have access to source items. Check the connections and positions of neighboring entities to resolve waiting issues.\n\n#### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Make sure there is a valid destination for inserter outputs. If an inserter is blocked, check for any items on the ground or ensure that a sink entity is in place to accept the output."}
