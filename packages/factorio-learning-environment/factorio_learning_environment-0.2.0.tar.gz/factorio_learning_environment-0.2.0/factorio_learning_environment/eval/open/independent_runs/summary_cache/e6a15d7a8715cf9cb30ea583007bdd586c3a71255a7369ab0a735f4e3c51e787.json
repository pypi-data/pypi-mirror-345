{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel and currently extracting iron ore. It has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore (583 items).\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) currently full of coal (50 items) and producing iron plates (85 items). It has warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt and that the fuel source is full.\n\n### Additional Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing iron ore (661 items) and iron plates (100 items).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target entity (like a furnace) has available space before attempting to insert items. The error indicates that the stone furnace's inventory is full, preventing the insertion of coal.\n\n### Errors related to accessing attributes of objects\n- Avoid accessing non-existent attributes on objects, such as trying to access `inventory` on a `Furnace` object. Verify the correct attributes for the object type being used.\n\n### Repeated errors with coal insertion\n- The error related to inserting coal into the furnace has occurred multiple times. This indicates a persistent issue with the furnace being full. Regularly check the furnace's inventory status before attempting to insert fuel.\n\n### General inventory management\n- Maintain awareness of inventory limits and ensure that items are properly managed to avoid full inventories, which can lead to errors during item insertion.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item_type, target_entity, quantity)`: This function has failed due to the target entity's inventory being full.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dictionary containing current inventory items (type: dict).\n- `furnace`: Reference to the furnace object (type: Furnace).\n- `burner_mining_drill`: Reference to the burner mining drill object (type: BurnerMiningDrill).\n- `wooden_chest`: Reference to the wooden chest object (type: Chest)."}
