{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at position(40.0, -85.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 40.0, -85.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) collecting coal output\n- Current coal storage: 168 units\n- Setup is working efficiently\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup\n- Burner mining drill (position 3.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (5.0, -60.0) smelting iron plates\n- Drill drop position at (4.5, -60.5)\n- Both machines are operational and fueled\n- Warning: Output is currently blocked by items on ground\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear of other entities before placing new structures\n- Check for items on ground that might block placement\n- Consider spacing between entities when placing connected structures\n- Pay attention to water tiles which prevent building\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting to place them\n- Example: Attempted to place wooden chest without having it in inventory\n\n### Structure Alignment Issues\n- When placing connected structures (like drill-furnace setups), ensure proper spacing and alignment\n- Consider the direction of entities and their input/output positions\n- Use the drop_position property to verify correct placement locations\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity()`: Places an entity at specific coordinates\n- `place_entity_next_to()`: Places an entity adjacent to another with specified spacing and direction\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drop_position`: Position(x, y) - Coordinates where entities output items\n- `direction`: Direction enum (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) - Entity orientation\n- `status`: EntityStatus enum (WORKING, NO_FUEL, NORMAL) - Current entity state\n- `inventory`: Dictionary of items and quantities"}
