{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Steam Power Plant (around x=-5.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-5.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-2.0, 23.5) with coal fuel\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Complex pipe network connecting these components:\n  - Water pipes from offshore pump to boiler (x=-8.5 to -3.5, y=23.5)\n  - Steam pipes connecting boiler to steam engine through various vertical and horizontal segments\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (around x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at position(-14.5, -48.5) containing 392 iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position(-14.0, -47.0) with coal fuel\n\n### Smelting Array (around x=0.0 to x=6.0, y=0.0 to y=4.0)\nConsists of multiple stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel\n- Furnace at position(2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel\n- Furnace at position(4.0, 4.0) with coal fuel\n- Furnace at position(6.0, 4.0) with coal fuel\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production (around x=24.5, y=4.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position(24.5, 4.5)\n- Input chest at position(21.5, 4.5) containing 770 iron plates\n- Output chest at position(27.5, 4.5) containing 430 copper plates and 16 science packs\n- Two burner inserters at positions(22.5, 4.5) and (26.5, 4.5)\n\n### Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs connected to electricity network ID 76288, currently researching automation technology\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with pipe placement\n- Ensure target location is clear of existing entities before placing pipes\n- Check if the pipe placement position is valid and not overlapping with other structures\n- When connecting pipe networks, ensure proper alignment and spacing\n\n### Power network issues\n- Steam engine not receiving power due to incomplete fluid connections\n- Labs not receiving power - ensure proper electrical pole connections and power generation\n\n### Production line issues\n- Assembling machine lacking resources (copper plates and iron gear wheels)\n- Burner mining drill lacking fuel\n- Multiple furnaces idle due to missing ingredients\n\n### Fluid system problems\n- Multiple pipe groups showing empty status\n- Boiler and steam engine showing no fluid present warnings\n- Ensure proper fluid flow path from offshore pump through boiler to steam engine"}
