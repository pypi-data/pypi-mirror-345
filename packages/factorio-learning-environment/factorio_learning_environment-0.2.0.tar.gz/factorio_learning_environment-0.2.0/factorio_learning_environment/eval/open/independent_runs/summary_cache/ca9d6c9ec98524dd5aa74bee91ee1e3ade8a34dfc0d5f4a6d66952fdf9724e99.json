{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction Structure at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5), a steam engine at position(23.5, 45.5), and a boiler at position(22.5, 41.0) connected via power poles at positions(19.5, 42.5), (18.5, 42.5), (21.5, 43.5), (21.5, 44.5), and (21.5, 45.5), and pipes connecting the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Water Supply Structure at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5) and a pipe group connected to it, stretching to the boiler at position(22.5, 41.0)\n\n### Steam Generation and Electricity Generation Structure\nThe boiler at position(22.5, 41.0) and the steam engine at position(23.5, 45.5) form a single structure that generates steam and electricity. The boiler is connected to the offshore pump via a pipe group, and the steam engine is connected to the boiler via another pipe group.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure the target location is clear of other entities or unplaceable terrain before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Verify that all variables are defined before using them in the code.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on water or unplaceable terrain\n- Check the terrain type before placing entities to avoid water or other unplaceable areas.\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent attributes of an entity\n- Verify the attributes of an entity before accessing them to avoid attribute errors.\n\n### Errors when trying to get a non-existent entity\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with no valid connections\n- Make sure none of the source or target connections points are blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n\n### Errors when using min() function on an empty sequence\n- Verify that the sequence is not empty before using the min() function.\n\n### Errors when checking connections between entities\n- The error at Step 37 indicates a failure to find valid connections between the offshore pump and the boiler. Ensure that the pipe group connecting them is not blocked and that the target entity is able to receive the fluid.\n\n### Errors due to undefined names\n- At Step 41, an error occurred due to an undefined name 'electric'. Ensure that all names are defined before using them.\n- At Step 63, an error occurred due to an undefined variable 'new_pumpjack'. Ensure that all variables are defined before using them.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or power\n- At Step 55, the pumpjack and boiler were not working due to lack of power and fuel respectively. Ensure that the entities are receiving the necessary resources to function.\n- At Step 110, the pumpjack and boiler were not working due to lack of power and fuel respectively. Ensure that the entities are receiving the necessary resources to function.\n- At Step 112, no coal was available in the inventory to refuel the boiler. Ensure that the entities are receiving the necessary resources to function.\n- At Step 119, no coal was available in the inventory to refuel the boiler. Ensure that the entities are receiving the necessary resources to function.\n- At Step 125, the pumpjack and boiler were not working due to lack of power and fuel respectively. Ensure that the entities are receiving the necessary resources to function.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place a pumpjack at an invalid location\n- At Steps 76, 79 and 87, an error occurred when attempting to place a pumpjack at a target location. Ensure that the location is valid and suitable for a pumpjack.\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- At Step 95, an error occurred when trying to connect the offshore pump to the boiler. Ensure that the pipe group connecting them is not blocked and that the target entity is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities via power poles\n- At Step 107, an error occurred when trying to connect the steam engine to the boiler via power poles. Ensure that the power poles are placed correctly and that the entities are properly connected.\n- At Step 118, an error occurred when trying to place a power pole next to the steam engine. Ensure that the target location is clear and that the power pole can be placed.\n- At Step 125, an error occurred when trying to place a power pole next to the steam engine. Ensure that the target location is clear and that the power pole can be placed.\n\n### Errors when placing power poles or storage tanks\n- At Step 115, an error occurred when attempting to place a"}
