{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected by pipes forming a water and steam system\n- Small electric pole at position (0.5, 8.5) providing power distribution\nThe system is currently working and producing approximately 453 steam per 60 seconds.\n\n### Coal Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-8.5, 6.5) containing 200 coal\n- Wooden chest at position (-2.5, 1.5) containing 196 coal\nThese chests serve as manual coal storage for the boiler.\n\n### Crude Oil Production System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pumpjack at position (20.5, 43.5) extracting from crude oil resource (299,940 units)\n- Small electric poles connecting to the power grid at position (19.5, 41.5)\n- Five storage tanks in sequence:\n  - Storage tank 1 at position (26.5, 46.5)\n  - Storage tank 2 at position (34.5, 49.5)\n  - Storage tank 3 at position (42.5, 52.5)\n  - Storage tank 4 at position (50.5, 55.5)\n  - Storage tank 5 at position (58.5, 58.5)\n- Connected by an extensive pipe network\nThe system is currently working and producing approximately 838 crude oil per 60 seconds.\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nAn electricity network connecting the steam engine to the pumpjack, allowing the oil production system to function. The network consists of multiple small electric poles spanning from the power generation area to the oil field.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is already occupied\n- When placing inserters or other entities near existing structures, ensure there's enough clearance\n- Consider using the get_buildable_positions API to find valid placement locations\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items that aren't in inventory\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items\n- Keep track of resource consumption, especially for frequently used items like coal\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Verify that entities exist before trying to access them using index operations\n- Use conditional checks before accessing list elements (e.g., `if len(list) > 0:`)\n- Consider using try/except blocks when accessing potentially non-existent entities\n\n### Errors with fluid connections\n- Ensure proper pipe connections between fluid-handling entities\n- Verify that pipe networks form continuous paths without gaps"}
