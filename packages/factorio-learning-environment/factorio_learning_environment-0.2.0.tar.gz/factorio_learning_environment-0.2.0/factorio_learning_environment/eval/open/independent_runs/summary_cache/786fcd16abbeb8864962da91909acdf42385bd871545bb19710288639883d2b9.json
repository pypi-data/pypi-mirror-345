{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Mining and Smelting Complex\nLocated around position (-19.0, -50.0) to (4.5, 2.5), consists of:\n- Two burner mining drills at (-19.0, -50.0) and (-15.0, -50.0) with associated wooden chests at (-18.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Two stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\n- Input chest system:\n  - Two wooden chests at (-2.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) for ore input\n  - Burner inserters at (-1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5) feeding furnaces\n- Output chest system:\n  - Two wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5) and (2.5, 2.5) collecting iron plates\n  - Burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) moving plates to output chests\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Setup\nLocated around position (-28.0, -61.0) to (-6.0, 0.0), consists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) with wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-6.0, 0.0)\n\n###Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-12.0, 20.5), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting water supply\n- Boiler at (-12.0, 20.5)\n- Steam engine at (-8.5, 20.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting at positions (8.5, 2.5), (-3.5, 15.5), (-8.5, 18.5), (0.5, 11.5), (4.5, 7.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Lab entity access errors\n- The lab entity at position (8.5, 2.5) cannot be accessed. Verify the lab exists at the specified coordinates before attempting to access it.\n\n### Research prerequisite errors\n- Cannot research Logistics 2 without first researching and creating logistic science packs. Research prerequisites must be completed in order.\n\n### Resource management errors\n- Mining drills show warnings about full output chests. Regularly empty the chests at (-27.5, -59.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) to maintain continuous mining.\n\n### Inventory errors\n- Attempting to insert coal when inventory is empty. Check coal availability in inventory before attempting insertion operations."}
