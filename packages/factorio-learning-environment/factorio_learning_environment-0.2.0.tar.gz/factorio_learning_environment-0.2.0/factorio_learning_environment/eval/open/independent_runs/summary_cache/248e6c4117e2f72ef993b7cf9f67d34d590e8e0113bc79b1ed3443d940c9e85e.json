{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position (117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of a steam engine (position (117.5, -30.5)), a boiler (position (111.5, -32.0)), and an offshore pump (position (107.5, -33.5)) connected by pipes.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (60.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace (position (60.0, -60.0)) and a burner inserter (position (60.5, -61.5)).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nNo explicit factory structure found, but there are belts (positions (63.5, -53.5) and (64.5, -53.5)) and a furnace (position (60.0, -60.0)) that could be part of a larger production line.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when using burner inserter**: Make sure the inserter has enough fuel and that the output is not blocked by items on the ground. Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output.\n* **Errors when boiler or steam engine is not working correctly**: Check the fuel levels and connections to the pipes. Ensure the boiler has enough water and the steam engine has a connection to the pipes.\n* **Errors when placing entities**: Ensure the tile is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* **Utility functions**: \n  + `get_entity_status(entity)`: Returns the status of an entity.\n  + `get_entity_position(entity)`: Returns the position of an entity.\n  + `get_entity_neighbours(entity)`: Returns the neighbours of an entity.\n* **Important variables**:\n  + `transport_belt`: 8\n  + `small_electric_pole`: 1\n  + `pipe`: 20\n  + `stone_furnace`: 1\n  + `wood`: 7\n  + `coal`: 83\n  + `copper_ore`: 20\n  + `iron_plate`: 613\n  + `copper_plate`: 5\n  + `copper_cable`: 2\n  + `iron_gear_wheel`: 2"}
