{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Transport Belt at Position (39.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (40.5, -83.5), (41.5, -83.5), and (42.5, -83.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) supplied with coal\n- Burner Inserter at Position (1.5, 0.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden Chest at Position (2.5, 0.5) containing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at Position (3.5, 0.5) working\n- BeltGroup connecting the chest at Position (2.5, 0.5) to the inserter at Position (3.5, 0.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (22.5, 0.5) containing copper plates\n\n### Coal Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at Positions (28.5, 0.5), (30.5, 0.5), (32.5, 0.5), (34.5, 0.5), (36.5, 0.5), (38.5, 0.5), and (40.5, 0.5) containing coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Non-callable Objects\n- Ensure that objects like 'Chest' are correctly instantiated and callable before attempting operations like removal.\n\n### NameError with Undefined Entities\n- Verify that all entity names, such as 'BurnerInserter', are correctly defined and imported in the script. Consider using the correct entity names like 'burner_inserter', 'burner_inserter_1', and 'burner_inserter_2' as suggested.\n\n### TypeError with isinstance() Function\n- When using isinstance(), ensure the second argument is a type, tuple of types, or a union. Avoid passing variable names as types.\n\n### ImportError with Incorrect Imports\n- Double-check import statements to ensure all necessary entities are correctly imported from their respective modules.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that source chests are adequately stocked with items to prevent inserters from waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors Handling Source Chests\n- Confirm that all source chests are defined and accessible in the code to avoid errors related to undefined names."}
