Verify the position and existence of the chest before executing operations.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly check the inventory capacity of chests to prevent insertion errors. Plan for additional storage or manage the inventory to avoid reaching full capacity.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is unoccupied. Remove any existing entities if necessary to free up space for new placements.\n\n### Errors with Empty Source Chests\n- Ensure that source chests contain the necessary items before attempting to move or insert items. Regularly monitor and refill source chests as needed to maintain production flow."}
