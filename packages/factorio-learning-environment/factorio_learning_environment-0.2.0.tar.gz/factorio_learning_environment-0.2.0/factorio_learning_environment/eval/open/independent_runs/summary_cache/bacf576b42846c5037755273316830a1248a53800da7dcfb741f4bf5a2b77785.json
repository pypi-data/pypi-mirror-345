{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining Setup at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace (position -27, -59)\n- Burner inserter (position -25.5, -58.5) \n- Wooden chest (position -24.5, -58.5) containing iron plates and copper plates\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills in a row (positions -10/-59, -8/-59, -6/-59) mining iron ore\n- Multiple wooden chests collecting ore (positions -9.5/-57.5, -7.5/-57.5, -5.5/-57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters managing material flow between components\n- Transport belt system connecting the mining area\n- Storage chests containing processed iron ore and plates\n\n### Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces in a row (positions 0/0, 2/0, 4/0, 6/0)\n- Input wooden chests (positions 0.5/-2.5, 2.5/-2.5, 4.5/-2.5, 6.5/-2.5)\n- Output wooden chests (positions 0.5/2.5, 2.5/2.5, 4.5/2.5, 6.5/2.5)\n- Burner inserters managing input (positions 0.5/-1.5, 2.5/-1.5, 4.5/-1.5, 6.5/-1.5)\n- Burner inserters managing output (positions 0.5/1.5, 2.5/1.5, 4.5/1.5, 6.5/1.5)\n\n### Belt Transport System\n- Two major belt groups connecting mining and processing areas\n- First group: From (-9.5, -54.5) to (0.5, -4.5)\n- Second group: From (-6.5, -54.5) to (-4.5, -54.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Ensure target placement location is clear of other entities\n- When placing entities next to each other, verify there is enough space between them\n- Consider using different spacing or direction if initial placement fails\n\n### Output Blocking Issues\n- Ensure there is a valid output destination (chest, belt, etc.) before items are produced\n- Place appropriate collection entities at drop positions to prevent items blocking output\n- Verify the entire production chain has proper item flow paths\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices\n- Ensure consistent material flow between processing stages\n- Set up proper input/output connections for all production entities"}
