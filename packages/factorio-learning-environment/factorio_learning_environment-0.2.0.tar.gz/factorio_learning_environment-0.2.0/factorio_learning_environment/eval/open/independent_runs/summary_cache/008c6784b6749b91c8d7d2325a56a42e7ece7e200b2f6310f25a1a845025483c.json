Ensure all variables are properly defined and assigned values before being used in crafting logic.\n\n### Inserter blocked by transport belt\n- The inserter at (40.5, -80.5) is blocked by the transport belt at (39.5, -80.5), and the inserters at (6.5, -57.5) and (8.5, -57.5) are also blocked. Ensure that inserters and transport belts are placed in a configuration that allows items to flow freely. Check the orientation and placement of these entities to avoid blockages.\n\n### Errors when extracting\n- The agent is failing to extract transport belts from the inventory due to an unassigned local variable 'x'. Ensure all variables are properly defined and assigned values before being used in extraction logic.\n\n### Not enough resources\n- The agent does not have enough iron ore in inventory to perform the desired action. Make sure to mine enough iron ore before attempting actions that require it.\n- The agent does not have enough wooden chests in inventory to perform the desired action. Make sure to craft enough wooden chests before attempting actions that require it.\n\n### Transport belt missing\n- The transport belt is no longer there. Ensure that transport belts are not accidentally removed or destroyed.\n\nNAMESPACE\n- No new functions were defined in this step.\n```"}
