Check for existing objects in the way and adjust the position or spacing accordingly.\n\n### Errors when extracting from full furnaces\n- Ensure that the target furnace is not full and contains the expected items before attempting to extract. Verify the presence of the correct entity and its contents.\n\n### Errors when supplying resources without inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to supply resources to furnaces or other entities.\n\n### Errors when clearing mining drill output\n- Make sure there is enough space in the connected chests or storage to receive the output from mining drills. Regularly clear or manage the inventory of these chests to avoid overflow.\n\n### Errors when automating resource transfer\n- Verify that the placement of inserters and chests does not interfere with existing setups. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions to ensure smooth automation."}
