# heap_tree

A type of [tree](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/tree/tree.md) data structure that satisfies the heap property: the value of each [node](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/node.md) is greater than or equal to (or less than or equal to) the values of its children. This property allows for efficient retrieval of the minimum (or maximum) element in the tree.
