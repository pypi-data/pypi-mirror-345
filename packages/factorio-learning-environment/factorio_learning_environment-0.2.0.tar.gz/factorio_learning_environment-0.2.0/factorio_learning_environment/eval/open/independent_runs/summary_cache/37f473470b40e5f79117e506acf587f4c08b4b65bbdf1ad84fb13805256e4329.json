{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Input wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage (both full with 1600 coal each)\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around x=45-47, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input wooden chest at (45.5, -79.5) containing iron ore\n- Output wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n- Additional wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Check for existing entities before placing inserters - multiple attempts failed due to occupied spaces\n- When using place_entity_next_to(), ensure proper spacing and check for existing entities like chests\n- Consider the full dimensions of entities when placing adjacent structures\n\n### System Status Issues\n- Furnaces are idle due to no ingredients despite having fuel\n- Need to ensure proper material flow from input chests to furnaces\n- Consider optimizing the chest placement and inserter configurations to enable smooth material transfer\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- place_entity(): Places entities at specific coordinates\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places entities adjacent to reference positions with specified spacing and direction\n\n### Key Variables\n- first_inserter: EntityType.BURNER_INSERTER\n- second_inserter: EntityType.BURNER_INSERTER\n\n### System Status Variables\n- Mining drill fuel level: coal (working state)\n- Furnace fuel levels: 50 and 49 coal respectively\n- Chest inventories tracked for coal, iron ore, and iron plates"}
