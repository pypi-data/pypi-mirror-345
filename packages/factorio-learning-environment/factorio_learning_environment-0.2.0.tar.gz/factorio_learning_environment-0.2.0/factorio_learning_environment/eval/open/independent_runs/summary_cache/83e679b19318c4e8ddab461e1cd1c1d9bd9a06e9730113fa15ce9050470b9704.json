The error message indicates a 'NoneType' object issue, suggesting that an entity or its attributes were not properly defined before attempting to connect belts.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from mining drills or other production entities. This prevents the output from being blocked by items on the ground, which can halt production processes."}
