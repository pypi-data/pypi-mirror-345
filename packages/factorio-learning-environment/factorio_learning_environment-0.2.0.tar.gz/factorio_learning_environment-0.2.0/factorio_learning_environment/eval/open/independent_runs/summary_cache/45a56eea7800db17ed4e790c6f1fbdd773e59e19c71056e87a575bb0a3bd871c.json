{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), responsible for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring items between the mining drill and the furnace.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) and (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) managing the movement of items between furnaces and chests.\n  - At position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) awaiting source items.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - At positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) storing iron plates transferred from furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not full. Consider adding more storage or managing inventory to prevent blockages.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source for the inserter has items available for transfer. Ensure the supply chain is continuous and not interrupted.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly transfer items from furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Consider automating this process with inserters and chests.\n\n### Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Automate refueling if possible to maintain efficiency."}
