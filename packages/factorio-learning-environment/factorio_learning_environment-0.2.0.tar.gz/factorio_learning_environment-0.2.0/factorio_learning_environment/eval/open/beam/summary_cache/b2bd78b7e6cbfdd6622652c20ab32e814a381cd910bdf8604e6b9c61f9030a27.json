{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (1.0, -60.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (1.0, -60.0) to mine iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (1.5, -58.5) to collect iron ore from the drill.\n- **Belt Group** connecting the drill to the chest:\n  - Input belt at (1.5, -58.5) \u2192 (1.5, -56.5), direction DOWN.\n  - Output belt at (4.5, -52.5) \u2192 (6.5, -52.5), direction RIGHT.\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at position (61.0, -54.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (61.0, -54.0) to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Belt Group** connecting the furnace to other structures:\n  - Input belt at (1.5, -57.5) \u2192 (3.5, -57.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Output belt at (9.5, -58.5) \u2192 (11.5, -58.5), direction RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors related to insufficient inventory for crafting or placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to craft or place entities. For example:\n  - Crafting a **Burner Mining Drill** requires **iron plates** and **iron gear wheels**.\n  - Crafting **Transport Belts** requires **iron plates** and **iron gear wheels**.\n  - Placing a **Wooden Chest** requires **wood**.\n\n#### Errors related to connecting belts without sufficient items\n- Ensure you have enough **Transport Belts** in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example:\n  - Connecting belts from the mining drill to the furnace requires **Transport Belts** in your inventory.\n\n#### Errors related to smelting and crafting dependencies\n- Ensure you have enough raw materials (e.g., **iron ore**) and fuel (e.g., **coal**) to smelt **iron plates** before attempting to craft items that require them. For example:\n  - Crafting **Iron Gear Wheels** requires **iron plates**.\n  - Crafting **Transport Belts** requires **iron plates** and **iron gear wheels**.\n\n#### Errors related to incorrect API usage\n- Avoid attempting to subscript a **BoundingBox** object directly. Use appropriate methods to access its properties.\n\n#### Errors related to insufficient resources for crafting\n- Always check the required amount of resources before crafting. For example:\n  - Crafting **Burner Mining Drills** requires **2 iron plates** and **3 iron gear wheels**.\n  - Crafting **Transport Belts** requires **1 iron plate** and **1 iron gear wheel** per belt.\n\n#### Errors related to placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. For example:\n  - Placing a **Wooden Chest** at (1.5, -58.5) requires the tile to be unoccupied.\n\n#### Errors related to inventory management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for crafting and placing entities. For example:\n  - Harvest **wood** for crafting **Wooden Chests**.\n  - Harvest **coal** for fueling furnaces and mining drills."}
