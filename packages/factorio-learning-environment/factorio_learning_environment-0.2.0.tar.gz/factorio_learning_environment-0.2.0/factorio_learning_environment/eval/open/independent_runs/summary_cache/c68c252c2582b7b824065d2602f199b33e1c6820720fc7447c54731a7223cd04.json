{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity group at position (x=52.5, y=49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup (id=168923) with poles at positions:\n  - (x=46.5, y=46.5)\n  - (x=34.5, y=49.5)\n  - (x=41.5, y=48.5)\n  - (x=34.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=2.5, y=2.5)\n  - (x=4.5, y=25.5)\n\n### Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of:\n- OffshorePump (name='offshore-pump') at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) connected to pipes at positions:\n  - (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=22.5)\n\n### PipeGroup at position (x=4.5, y=5.5)\nConsists of:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=67101, fluid=water) with pipes at various positions including:\n  - (x=4.5, y=5.5)\n  - (x=5.5, y=5.5)\n  - (x=6.5, y=5.5)\n  - ... up to (x=46.5, y=45.5)\n\n### Furnace at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (name='stone-furnace') at position (x=1.0, y=1.0) with a status of 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n\n### Lab at position (x=6.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (status=NO_POWER, research=automation) at position (x=6.5, y=1.5).\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (x=8.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- BurnerInserter (name='burner-inserter') at position (x=8.5, y=1.5) with a status of 'out of fuel'.\n\n### Chest at position (x=3.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chest (name='wooden-chest') at position (x=3.5, y=1.5) containing 'iron-plate'.\n\n### Chest at position (x=3.5, y=3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chest (name='wooden-chest') at position (x=3.5, y=3.5) containing 'iron-plate'.\n\n### Chest at position (x=3.5, y=5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chest (name='wooden-chest') at position (x=3.5, y=5.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any entities or terrain obstacles (e.g., water). Check the coordinates before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when getting entities\n- Verify the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. If the entity is not found, ensure that the coordinates are correct and that the entity has not been removed or placed elsewhere.\n\n### Repeated errors in electric pole placement\n- The agent repeatedly attempted to place electric poles at (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0) without success due to blockages. Consider scouting the area for alternative locations or clearing the blockages before attempting to place the poles again."}
