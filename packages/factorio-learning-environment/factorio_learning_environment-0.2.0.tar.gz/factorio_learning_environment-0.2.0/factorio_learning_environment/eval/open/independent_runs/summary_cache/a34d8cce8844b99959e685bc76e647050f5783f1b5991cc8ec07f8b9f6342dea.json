{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation\n- **Electric mining drills** at positions (15.5, 70.5), (18.5, 70.5), and (21.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnaces** at positions (16.0, 73.0), (19.0, 73.0), and (22.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Output system** consisting of wooden chests at positions (16.5, 75.5), (19.5, 75.5), and (22.5, 75.5) with inserters at positions (16.5, 74.5), (19.5, 74.5), and (22.5, 74.5) to transfer smelted plates into chests.\n\n#### Power Generation Setup (Incomplete)\n- **Offshore pump** at position (-9.5, -0.5) intended to supply water.\n- **Boiler** at position (-8.0, 0.5) intended to convert water to steam.\n- **Steam engine** at position (-2.5, -0.5) intended to generate electricity.\n- **Small electric poles** placed to connect power to the mining operation.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Fluid Connection Errors\n- **Incorrect fluid connection between offshore pump and boiler**: Ensure the offshore pump is placed adjacent to the boiler and correctly aligned to allow fluid transfer. The pump must face the boiler's input connection point.\n- **Steam engine not receiving steam**: Verify the boiler is correctly connected to the steam engine with pipes and that the boiler is fueled and operational.\n\n#### Power Connection Issues\n- **Electric mining drills and inserters not receiving power**: Ensure all electric entities are within the coverage area of electric poles and that the power network is properly connected and operational.\n\n#### Placement and Alignment Errors\n- **Misaligned entity placement**: When placing entities like offshore pumps and boilers, ensure they are correctly aligned to allow fluid transfer. The connection points must face each other.\n- **Blocked connection points**: Ensure no obstacles are blocking the connection points between entities like pumps, boilers, and steam engines.\n\n#### General Tips\n- **Check entity statuses**: Always verify the status of entities (e.g., `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED`, `EntityStatus.NO_POWER`) to diagnose issues.\n- **Fuel and ingredients**: Ensure boilers have fuel and furnaces have ingredients to operate."}
