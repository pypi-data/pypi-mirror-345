{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler requires water and fuel to produce steam, which powers the steam engine to generate electricity.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) which extracts coal.\n- Wooden chests located at positions (46.5, -83.5), (48.5, -83.5), (5.5, -79.5), and (10.5, -79.5) for storage of resources.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to missing inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or connect entities. For example, the Offshore Pump cannot be placed as it is not in inventory.\n\n### Errors when connecting structures\n- Make sure to have pipes available to connect the Boiler to the Steam Engine. If no pipes are available, you will not be able to establish the necessary connections for the electricity generator.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
