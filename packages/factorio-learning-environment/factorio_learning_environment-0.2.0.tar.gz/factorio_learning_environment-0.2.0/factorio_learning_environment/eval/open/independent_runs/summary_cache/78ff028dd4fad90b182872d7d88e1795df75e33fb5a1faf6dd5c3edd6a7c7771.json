{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (-44.5, -119.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) and Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to Small Electric Pole at Position (5.5, -60.5) and Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Lab with no power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before attempting to place a pipe. Remove any existing entities that may be in the way.\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected from the offshore pump to the boiler to ensure water flow. Check for any disconnected segments in the piping system.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Connect the steam engine to the power network using electric poles to ensure it can distribute generated power.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that the inserter is connected to a powered electric pole. Check the power network for any disconnections or lack of power supply."}
