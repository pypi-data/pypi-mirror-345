{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) connected to two Wooden Chests at positions (x=52.5, y=-80.5) and (x=53.5, y=-80.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) transferring items from the Wooden Chests to another Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-78.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (x=53.5, y=-78.5) and (x=55.5, y=-78.5) moving items between chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=54.5, y=-78.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) and Wooden Chests at positions (x=-10.5, y=-49.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) transferring items between chests.\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (x=-8.5, y=-48.5), (x=-9.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) facilitating item movement.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) for storage.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5), (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=3.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing various resources including iron ore, coal, wood, and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Extracting Resources\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity before attempting to extract resources. This will prevent extraction failures.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items into Full Inventories\n- Check the inventory capacity of the target entity before inserting items. If the inventory is full, clear space or redirect items to another storage.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing a new entity. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills and Burner Inserters to ensure continuous operation and avoid stoppages.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `place_entity_next_to`: Attempts to place an entity next to a specified position with given spacing and direction. Failed due to occupied target positions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `new_iron_ore_chest`: Represents a new chest intended to be placed near an existing iron ore chest. Placement failed due to space constraints.\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'burner-inserter', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
