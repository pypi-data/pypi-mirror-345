Consider managing inventory space to avoid running out of iron ore.\n\n### Errors when clearing mining drill outputs\n- Ensure that storage chests are not full before attempting to clear outputs from mining drills. Regularly check and empty chests to maintain smooth operations.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly manage and clear your inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can hinder harvesting and supplying activities.\n\n### Errors when extracting from full furnaces\n- Ensure there is enough space in your inventory before extracting items from full furnaces to avoid extraction failures."}
