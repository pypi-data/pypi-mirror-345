{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (17.5, 20.5) with warnings: 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections', status: NOT_CONNECTED.\n- Boiler at Position (1.5, 23.0) with warning: 'out of fuel', status: NO_FUEL.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5), status: WORKING.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at Position (9.5, 15.5), fluid system 24787, status: EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup at Position (6.5, 21.5), fluid system 24797, status: EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup at Position (-9.5, 23.5), fluid system 24799, fluid: water, status: FULL_OUTPUT.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, voltage: 0.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and positioned to connect between entities. Verify that there are no obstructions or misalignments in the connection path.\n- Check that the entities intended to be connected are compatible with the pipe types being used.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to ensure continuous operation. Refuel as necessary to avoid disruptions.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities(Position, Position, Set[Prototype])`: Function to connect entities using pipes. Failure occurs if entities are not aligned or compatible.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: Type: List[Pipe], stores the connected pipes between entities.\n  - `steam-engine`: Type: Generator, stores the steam engine entity details.\n  - `boiler`: Type: Boiler, stores the boiler entity details.\n  - `offshore-pump`: Type: OffshorePump, stores the offshore pump entity details."}
