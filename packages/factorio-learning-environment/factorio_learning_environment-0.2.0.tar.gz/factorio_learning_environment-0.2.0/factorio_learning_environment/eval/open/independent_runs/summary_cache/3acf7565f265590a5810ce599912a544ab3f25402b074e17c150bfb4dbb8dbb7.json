{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-13.5, 23.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Multiple Pipe Groups connecting various positions, with some pipes having status FULL_OUTPUT and others EMPTY.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target position before attempting to place a pipe or underground pipe. Clear any existing obstructions first.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that the target positions for connecting pipes are valid and unobstructed. Ensure that the connection path is clear and that the correct entities are being connected.\n\n### Errors with Entity Connection\n- Make sure all components of a structure, such as steam engines and boilers, are properly connected to each other and to the power network to ensure functionality.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Keep track of inventory levels to ensure sufficient resources are available for construction and connection tasks. Gather more resources if necessary.\n\n### Errors in Function Calls\n- Ensure that all function calls, such as those for connecting pipes, have the correct arguments and data types, especially when dealing with position objects."}
