{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n  - Connected to two **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Refueled with coal, producing iron plates.\n  - Connected to a **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Refueled with coal, producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Waiting for source items, intended to transfer iron plates to a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Stores iron plates transferred from the furnaces.\n\n### Ore Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to another **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the required source items. Check the connected chests or belts to ensure they are not empty.\n\n### Errors with No Iron Plates Available in Input Chest\n- Ensure that iron plates are being produced and transferred correctly to the input chest. Verify that the furnaces are operational and that the inserters are functioning properly.\n\n### Errors with No Coal to Insert\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel entities. Regularly check and replenish coal stocks as needed.\n\n### Errors with Entity Not Found at Specified Position\n- Verify the positions and existence of entities before attempting to interact with them. Ensure that the correct entity type is being targeted at the specified location."}
