{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity group at position (x=52.5, y=49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric pole (position x=52.5, y=49.0)\n- Electric pole (position x=52.5, y=54.0)\n\n### Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe (position x=-9.5, y=22.5)\n- Pipe (position x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position x=1.0, y=1.0)\n- Chest (position x=3.5, y=1.5)\n- Lab (position x=6.5, y=1.5)\n- Furnace (position x=10.0, y=1.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=8.5, y=1.5)\n- Chest (position x=3.5, y=3.5)\n- Chest (position x=3.5, y=5.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any obstructing entities or terrain that cannot be built upon (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the specified position contains the entity type you are trying to retrieve. If the entity does not exist at that position, adjust the position accordingly.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The errors related to placing electric poles and retrieving the steam engine at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) have occurred multiple times. Ensure to check the area for obstructions and confirm the existence of the entities before attempting to place or retrieve them."}
