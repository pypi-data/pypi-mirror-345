# hash_table

Data structure that implements [associative array](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/collection/associative_array.md) using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Hash tables are designed to provide fast access to data by using a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.
