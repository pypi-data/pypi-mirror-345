{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System (Around y=-80)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0), both fueled with coal\n- Input wooden chest at (46.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Two burner inserters at (46.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5) configured to feed furnaces from input chest\n- Multiple storage chests:\n  - Wooden chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n  - Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing coal\n\n### Coal Mining Setup (Around y=-83)\nMining system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) positioned over coal deposit\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing mined coal\n- Supporting wooden chests at (45.5, -84.5) and (46.5, -83.5)\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) for material handling\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Specific error seen when trying to place burner-inserter at (45.5, -79.5)\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Ensure inserters are properly configured with correct pickup and drop positions\n- When reconfiguring inserters, maintain consistent direction between pickup and drop points\n- Verify inserter's facing direction matches intended material flow\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep mining drills fueled to prevent \"out of fuel\" warnings\n- Monitor chest capacity to prevent \"chest is full\" warnings\n- Ensure sufficient materials are available before attempting insertion operations\n\n### System Design\n- When designing automated systems, ensure complete material flow paths are established\n- Address \"output blocked\" warnings by providing proper output collection points\n- Verify all components (inserters, furnaces, chests) are properly connected in the logistics chain\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- left_furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- right_furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- EntityStatus: Enum (NO_INGREDIENTS, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, NORMAL, NO_FUEL)\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map, fails if location is occupied\n- reset_inserter(): Configures inserter's facing direction\n- reconfigure_inserter(): Sets inserter's pickup and drop positions"}
