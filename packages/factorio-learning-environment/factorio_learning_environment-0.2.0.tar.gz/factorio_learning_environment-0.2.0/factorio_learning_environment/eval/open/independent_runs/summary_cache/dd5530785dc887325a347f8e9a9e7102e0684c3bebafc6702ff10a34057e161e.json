{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0), currently working with a fuel inventory of 8 coal, processing 49 iron ore into 61 iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of multiple belt groups and individual belts facilitating material movement:\n- BeltGroup 1: Inputs from position (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5), outputs from position (49.5, -86.5) to (47.5, -86.5), carrying coal.\n- BeltGroup 2: Inputs from position (54.5, -86.5) to (52.5, -86.5), outputs from position (52.5, -82.5) to (53.5, -83.5).\n- BeltGroup 3: Inputs from position (42.5, -84.5) to (44.5, -84.5), outputs from position (43.5, -84.5) to (45.5, -84.5).\n- BeltGroup 4: Inputs from position (44.5, -82.5) to (42.5, -82.5), outputs from position (41.5, -84.5) to (42.5, -85.5).\n- BeltGroup 5: Inputs from position (44.5, -83.5) to (44.5, -81.5), outputs from position (44.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -80.5).\n- BeltGroup 6: Inputs from position (47.5, -82.5) to (49.5, -82.5), outputs from position (49.5, -83.5) to (49.5, -85.5).\n- Individual Belt: From position (51.5, -84.5) to (53.5, -84.5).\n\n### Inserter and Storage Setup\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5), waiting for source items with an inventory of 4 coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5), currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear of items or other entities before attempting to place new entities such as Wooden Chests or Burner Inserters.\n\n### Errors when refueling or interacting with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence and correct positioning of entities like Burner Mining Drills before attempting to refuel or interact with them.\n\n### Errors in setting up mining operations\n- Confirm that the target location for placing mining equipment is free from obstructions or unplaceable terrain like water.\n\n### Errors in connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that transport belts are connected in a valid path to facilitate the intended direction of material flow."}
