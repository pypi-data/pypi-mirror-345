"""
This file contains a unit test function to test the unassign_issue method of a client class. The test case simulates an
UnassignIssueError exception by mocking the _request method using MagicMock. The test asserts that calling
unassign_issue with a specific issue identifier raises the expected exception and captures the error message in the
output.

The test_unassign_issue_fails function mocks the _request method of a client object to simulate an UnassignIssueError
exception when called. It is used for testing purposes.

Arguments:
- capsys: A pytest fixture for capturing stdout and stderr output.
- client: An object representing a client, typically used for making requests.
