{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=52.5, y=-84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-23.0, y=-66.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the mining drill to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-23.0, y=-66.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (x=1.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the character to the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors with inserter status checks\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured and has a power source before checking its status. If an inserter is not working, ensure it is properly fueled and connected to a source and destination.\n\n### Errors when attempting to smelt without ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt before attempting to use them. Check the supply chain to ensure resources are being delivered to the furnace."}
