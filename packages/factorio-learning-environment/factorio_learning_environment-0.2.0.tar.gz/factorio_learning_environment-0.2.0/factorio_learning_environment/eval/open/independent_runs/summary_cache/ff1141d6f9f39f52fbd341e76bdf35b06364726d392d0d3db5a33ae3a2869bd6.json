{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and currently processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and currently processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Inserter and Chest Setup at Position (4.5, 1.5) and (6.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (4.5, 1.5) which is refueled but has warnings indicating it is out of fuel and its output is blocked due to no sink entity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5) which is empty and positioned to potentially receive items from the inserter.\n\n### Belt Systems\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup with inputs at positions (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) and outputs at positions (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs at positions (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), and outputs at positions (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a valid destination entity for the inserter to place its output. The current setup has a blockage due to the lack of a sink entity.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Chest Utilization\n- Ensure that the chest is correctly positioned and has a clear path for items to be inserted from the inserter. The current setup shows the chest is empty, indicating a potential misalignment or blockage in the item flow."}
