Check for existing objects or unplaceable terrain like water.\n\n### Errors when Placing Steam Engines\n- Verify that the target location for placing steam engines is clear of obstructions and suitable for placement. Avoid areas with water or other unplaceable terrain.\n\n### Errors when Using Inventory\n- Make sure to have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft them. Check inventory levels to avoid running out of necessary components like pipes or iron plates.\n\n### Errors with API Usage\n- Ensure correct usage of API attributes and methods. For instance, use the correct attribute names like `PipeGroup` instead of `PipeToGround`.\n\n### Errors with Crafting\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items. For example, iron plates need to be smelted in a furnace and cannot be crafted directly.\n\n### Connection Issues\n- Check connections between entities, such as ensuring boilers and steam engines are properly connected to each other and to the power network."}
