{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the Offshore Pump to the Steam Engine with pipes at positions (-45.5, -122.5), (-44.5, -122.5), (-43.5, -122.5), (-42.5, -122.5), (-42.5, -123.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the Stone Furnace and a Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (-40.5, -116.5), (-39.5, -116.5), (-42.5, -114.5), (-42.5, -115.5), (-38.5, -114.5), (-38.5, -115.5), (-42.5, -113.5), (-42.5, -112.5), (-38.5, -113.5), (-38.5, -112.5), (-42.5, -111.5), (-40.5, -110.5), (-41.5, -110.5), (-38.5, -111.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Power Network\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network. Craft or gather additional Small Electric Poles if necessary.\n- Verify that the connection points are within range and that there are no obstructions between them.\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Check for any placement blockages before attempting to connect pipes. Ensure the path is clear and that pipes are placed correctly to connect the Offshore Pump to the Steam Engine.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a powered electric pole. Verify that the electricity network is complete and functioning.\n- Check that the Steam Engine is connected to the power network and receiving input liquid to generate electricity."}
