{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (x=-3.0, y=2.5) [fuel: 23 coal]\n- Steam engine (x=0.5, y=2.5)\nConnected by pipes and power poles (working, producing 13150.0 power)\n\n#### Oil Processing Facility\n1. Crude Oil Extraction:\n   - Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) [working, connected to power]\n   - Connected to crude oil input tank (x=4.5, y=15.5) [45.69 crude oil]\n\n2. Oil Refinery:\n   - Oil refinery (x=9.5, y=15.5) [working, Basic Oil Processing]\n   - Connected to:\n     - Crude oil input tank (x=4.5, y=15.5)\n     - Petroleum gas output tank (x=14.5, y=30.5) [130.25 petroleum gas]\n\n3. Chemical Processing:\n   - Chemical plant (x=2.5, y=8.5) [FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE, Sulfur recipe]\n   - Connected to:\n     - Water input (60 water)\n     - Petroleum gas input (not connected properly)\n     - Sulfur output tank (x=6.5, y=8.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent Pipe Connection Issues\n- Multiple failures connecting crude oil pipes between storage tank (x=4.5,y=15.5) and refinery (x=9.5,y=15.5)\n  - Clear ALL existing pipes completely before attempting new connections\n  - Verify path is unobstructed (no terrain/entity blockages)\n  - Consider using underground pipes for longer distances\n\n#### Fluid System Validation\n- Chemical plant shows FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE despite water connection\n  - Verify petroleum gas input connection is properly established\n  - Check fluid types match recipe requirements\n  - Monitor input tank levels before connecting\n\n#### Empty Source Connections\n- Attempted to connect empty petroleum gas source to chemical plant\n  - Ensure source tanks contain sufficient fluid before making connections\n  - Verify refinery is producing petroleum gas before connecting downstream\n\n#### Power System Maintenance\n- Steam engine connection error (attempting to connect to itself)\n  - Verify target entities are different from source entities\n  - Check connection points are facing correct directions\n\n#### General Fluid System Tips\n- When troubleshooting:\n  1. Verify fluid production at source (pumpjack/refinery)\n  2. Check storage tank levels\n  3. Validate pipe connections end-to-end\n  4. Confirm all power connections are active\n- Use underground pipes for cleaner layouts and fewer connection issues\n- Monitor entity status indicators for early problem detection\n\n#### Successful Fixes Implemented\n- Crude oil pipeline successfully established via alternative path\n- Refinery now operational with 45.69 crude oil input\n- Petroleum gas production confirmed (130.25 in storage)"}
