{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): This drill is fueled with coal and is actively mining iron ore. It drops the mined ore into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): This chest stores the iron ore mined by the burner mining drill. It is currently empty or low on iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): This inserter is responsible for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is fueled with coal but is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but is not receiving iron ore due to issues with the inserter setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Reposition and align the inserter as necessary to facilitate the transfer of iron ore.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is properly configured and operational to deliver iron ore to the furnace. Check the inserter's fuel status and ensure it is not waiting for source items.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly extract iron ore from the chest to maintain space for new resources.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel the burner mining drill, inserter, and furnace with coal to ensure continuous operation. Keep track of coal inventory to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Resource Availability\n- Ensure there is a sufficient supply of iron ore in the chest to keep the furnace operational. Address any warnings related to the lack of ingredients to smelt in the furnace."}
