It has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) - Empty\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) - Contains iron ore and iron plates\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions:\n  - (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) - Transfers items between entities, currently working.\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) - Waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Refueling\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel any entity. This will prevent errors related to failed refueling attempts.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly check and clear out full chests to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors when Using Insert Item Function\n- Verify that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will avoid exceptions related to missing items during insertion operations."}
