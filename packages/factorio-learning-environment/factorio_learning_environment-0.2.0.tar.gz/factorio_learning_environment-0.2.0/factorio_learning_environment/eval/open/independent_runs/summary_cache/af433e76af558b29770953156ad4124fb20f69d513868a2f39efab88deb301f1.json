{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map during these steps. The agent repeatedly attempted to provide a Lab for supplying Automation Science Packs (with a targeted placement at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5)); however, crafting and placement failed due to inventory and sub-ingredient shortages. Although furnaces were accessed for smelting\u2014an alternative furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron plate production and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production\u2014these operations used pre\u2010existing game entities rather than newly built structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors (get_entities):\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid supplying unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or incorrect positional parameters. Verify the function\u2019s signature before calling.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Verification:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the required Lab item is present in inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n\u2022 Crafting Chain Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all sub\u2010ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) can be produced or are available. Establish a working production chain and verify resource sufficiency prior to initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2022 Data Handling:\n\u2003\u2013 When iterating over returned entities (such as existing labs), safeguard against NoneType values by using appropriate fallback logic (for example, defaulting to an empty list)."}
