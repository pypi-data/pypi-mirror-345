{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler at positions (-4.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity Network consisting of multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various points:\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-1.5 y=16.5 connected to network at x=-6.5 y=16.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=0.5 y=16.5 directly connected to the steam engine\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=0.5 y=21.5 directly connected to the steam engine\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=0.5 y=24.5 connected to network at x=0.5 y=21.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-5.5 y=25.5 directly connected to the steam engine\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-7.5 y=15.5 connected to network at x=-6.5 y=16.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-3.5 y=22.5 connected to network at x=-7.5 y=15.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-4.5 y=22.5 connected to network at x=-3.5 y=22.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-3.5 y=20.5 connected to network at x=-4.5 y=22.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-3.5 y=19.5 connected to network at x=-3.5 y=20.5\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the target entity contains the items you wish to extract. For example, attempting to extract copper plates from a stone furnace that does not contain them will result in failure.\n\n### Errors when Crafting\n- Ensure you have sufficient materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items, such as Small Electric Poles.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Verify that you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal when none is available in your inventory will fail.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure the placement location is valid and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features like water. Attempting to place a small electric pole where it overlaps with water will result in failure.\n- Ensure you have the entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. Attempting to place a small electric pole without having one in the inventory will fail."}
