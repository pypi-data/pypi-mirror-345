{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for temporary storage of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) intended for smelting but currently lacking ingredients.\n- **Storage Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for storage of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore to the chest.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have available items to transfer. Regularly check and manage inventory levels to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Verify that furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials to process. Consider improving logistics to ensure continuous production.\n\n### ValueError in Code Execution\n- When using functions that require specific object types, such as `inspect_inventory`, ensure that the correct object type (Entity or Position) is passed as an argument to avoid type errors."}
