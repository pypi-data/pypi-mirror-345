{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) containing 59 coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) containing 397 iron ore\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (-10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0), both fueled with 23 coal each\n\n### Copper Processing Complex at (22, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) containing 203 copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0) fueled with 50 coal\n- Wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 51 copper plates\n- Multiple burner inserters creating an item transport chain:\n  - Inserter at (19.5, 21.5) moving items from drill to chest\n  - Inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving items from chest\n  - Inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving items to furnace\n  - Inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving finished plates to storage chest\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing transport belts\n- Check if the target position is clear before placing belts\n- Ensure there are no entities (including the character) standing on the planned belt path\n- When creating belt paths, verify that both the source and target positions are free of obstacles\n\n### Entity placement conflicts\n- Move away from the target position when placing entities\n- Verify that the entire footprint of the entity being placed is clear, not just the center position\n\n### Belt connection issues\n- When connecting entities with belts, ensure all intermediate positions are clear\n- Plan belt paths to avoid crossing through existing structures or entities\n- Consider using longer paths around obstacles if direct paths are blocked"}
