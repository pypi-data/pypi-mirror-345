{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest. Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore. Contains 9 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Requires coal for operation.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment or Setup Issues with Inserter\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Verify the pickup and drop positions of the inserter.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner mining drill and inserter to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that coal is available in the inventory for refueling purposes.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Monitor the chest's capacity to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly extract or process items from the chest to free up space.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the furnace is correctly set up to receive iron ore from the inserter. Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt and that the inserter is functioning properly."}
