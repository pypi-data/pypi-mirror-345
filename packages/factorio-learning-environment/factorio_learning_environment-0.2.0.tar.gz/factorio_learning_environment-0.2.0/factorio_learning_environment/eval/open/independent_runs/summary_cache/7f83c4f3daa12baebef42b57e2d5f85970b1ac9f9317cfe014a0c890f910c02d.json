Ensure that an inserter is added to input items into a steam engine rather than connecting a belt directly to it.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Distance Issue\n\u2003\u2013 When encountering placement errors due to maximum distance (e.g. target chest at (3.5,15.5) being too far from the player\u2019s position), move closer to the target position prior to placement.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Undefined Variable Errors\n\u2003\u2013 If an entity cannot be placed because it is not present in the inventory (such as the wooden chest missing after an attempted placement), verify and update the inventory before placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Resolve NameError issues (e.g. \u2018target_chest\u2019 is not defined) by ensuring the correct variable name is used and that it has been properly assigned.\n\n"}
