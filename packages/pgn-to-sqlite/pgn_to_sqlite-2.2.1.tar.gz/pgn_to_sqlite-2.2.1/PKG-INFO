# PGN to Sqlite

![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pgn-to-sqlite)
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/endlesstrax/pgn-to-sqlite)

A cli application for pulling pgn files from Chess.com and Lichess.org and putting your games into a sqlite database.

It can also be used to save pgn files from a local folder to a sqlite database.

## Install

> Requires Python 3.9 and above.

It is recommended that you install this package in a virtual or isoloated environment. The easiest way to do this is with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx).

```shell
pipx install pgn_to_sqlite
```

Alternatively, you can install it with pip into your virtual environment:

MacOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pgn_to_sqlite
```

Windows:

```powershell
python -m pip install pgn_to_sqlite
```

## Usage

```shell
Usage: pgn-to-sqlite [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Save your chess games to an sqlite database.

  You can `fetch` your games from chess.com or lichess.org. You can also
  `save` local pgn files to the database.

  Type `pgn-to-sqlite --help` for more information.

Options:
  -u, --user TEXT    You username for the chess site.
  -o, --output FILE  Where you would like your database saved?  [required]
  --help             Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  fetch  Fetch all games from the requested site.
  save   Fetch all pgn file from the given folder.
```

### Fetch games from chess.com or lichess.org

`username` and `output` are required when using `fetch` to download, parse, and save your games to your database. `fetch` accepts with `chess` or `lichess` as an argument for _[chess.com](https://www.chess.com)_ and _[lichess.org](https://lichess.org)_ respectively.

Example:

```shell
pgn-to-sqlite -u endlesstrax -o data.db fetch lichess
```

> If you've played a lot of games, **be patient**, it could take a minute or two.

### Save games from local folder

`output` is required when saving games from local pgn files to your database. `save` expects a folder path as an argument.

Example:

```shell
pgn-to-sqlite -o data.db save .\chess\games\
```
