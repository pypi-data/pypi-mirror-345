{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Main Belt Transport System\n- Large belt network with 107 transport belts\n- Main input at (-4.5, -52.5) flowing upward\n- Final output at (44.5, -81.5) flowing right\n- Currently carrying iron ore (10) and coal (1)\n\n### Inserter-Chest System\n- Burner inserter positioned to pick up from chest at (-6.5, -52.5)\n- Inserter configured to drop items at (-4.5, -52.5)\n- Wooden chest present (exact position unclear from logs)\n- Connected to main belt system\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always check and remove existing entities before placing new ones at a position\n- Multiple attempts to place belts failed due to existing entities at target positions\n\n### Belt Connection Issues\n- Ensure proper belt flow direction alignment when connecting different belt segments\n- Clear any blocked belts before attempting to modify the transport system\n\n### Inserter Configuration\n- Verify inserter drop position has a valid receiving entity (belt/chest)\n- Ensure proper orientation of inserter relative to source and destination\n- Check for blocked outputs before finalizing inserter placement\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `belt_group_inputs`: List[Belt] - Collection of input belt positions\n- `belt_group_outputs`: List[Belt] - Collection of output belt positions\n- `belt_directions`: List[Tuple[Position, Direction]] - Belt positions and their flow directions\n\n### System States\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION`: Inserter waiting for output space\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`: Inserter waiting for items to move\n- `EntityStatus.WORKING`: Normal operation state for belt systems\n\nThe agent appears to be working on optimizing a belt-based transport system with inserter integration, making multiple attempts to achieve proper alignment and flow."}
