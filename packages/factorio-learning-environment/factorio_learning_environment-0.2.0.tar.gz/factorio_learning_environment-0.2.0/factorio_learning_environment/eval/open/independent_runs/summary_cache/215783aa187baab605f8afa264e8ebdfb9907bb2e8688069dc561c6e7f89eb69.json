{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is responsible for generating electricity, while the boiler heats water to produce steam, and the offshore pump supplies water to the boiler.\n\n### Lab at position(2.5, -18.5)\nConsists of a lab (position 2.5, -18.5). The lab is used for research purposes and requires a power connection to operate.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0) and (5, 5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect (e.g., offshore pump and boiler) are within the correct range and orientation to allow for a successful connection. Check the positions and ensure there are no obstacles.\n\n### Errors when using electric connections\n- Verify that the electric poles are within range of the entities they are meant to power. If an entity shows a status of \"NO POWER,\" check the connections and adjust the positions of the poles as necessary.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the desired location to avoid placement errors."}
