Shared Smelting Furnaces Automation Network  \n   Purpose: Automates smelting processes by linking key processing units.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 Stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0)  \n   \u2022 Burner\u2011inserters deployed at locations including (\u201314.5, \u201352.5), (\u201313.5, \u201352.5), (\u201316.5, \u201348.5), (\u201311.5, \u201348.5), etc.  \n   \u2022 Wooden chests at positions such as (\u201313.5, \u201351.5), (\u201311.5, \u201346.5), (1.5, 1.5), (2.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 2.5)  \n   \u2022 BeltGroups interlinking these components for material routing  \n\n2. Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup  \n   Purpose: Automates the extraction and initial handling of iron ore.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 A burner\u2011mining drill at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0)  \n   \u2022 Associated burner\u2011inserters, transport belts, and chests that form the resource extraction and redistribution network  \n\n3. Steam Power Generation System  \n   Purpose: Provides power by converting fuel and water into steam energy.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 A boiler at (8.0, 20.5) with connection points at (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5)  \n   \u2022 Steam engines positioned at (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5) and (4.5, 23.5)  \n   \u2022 An extra steam engine remains unplaced in inventory due to persistent spatial congestion  \n\n4. Automation Research Lab  \n   Purpose: Supports technological research using automation science packs.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 Laboratory units (e.g., with electrical IDs 11057, 11109, 11135) that are currently experiencing power connectivity (NO_POWER) issues  \n\n5. Electrical, Transport, and Fluid Infrastructure  \n   Purpose: Establishes an integrated backbone for power distribution, material logistics, and fluid handling.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 ElectricityGroups (with various IDs such as 11135)  \n   \u2022 Several BeltGroups that interconnect production zones  \n   \u2022 Multiple PipeGroups forming interconnected fluid systems across the map  \n\n6. Offshore Pump and Fluid Network  \n   Purpose: Delivers a reliable water supply to fluid\u2010dependent processes.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 An offshore pump at (0.5, 30.5)  \n   \u2022 Associated PipeGroups routing water throughout the network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  - The extra steam engine remains unplaced owing to severe spatial congestion within the boiler zone, particularly around Position(8.0, 20.5) and its adjacent connection interfaces.  \n  - Overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts prevent the creation of a clear area for engine placement.  \n  - Mitigation: Manually reassess and clear the boiler zone and adjoining interfaces; remove or reposition conflicting entities and consider relocating the extra steam engine or redesigning the boiler layout to provide sufficient buildable space.\n\n\u2022 Fuel and Source Supply Warnings in Burner Entities  \n  - Multiple burner\u2011inserters and mining drills are flagged with \u201cNO_FUEL\u201d and \u201cWAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\u201d warnings, indicating inconsistent fuel or resource delivery.  \n  - Mitigation: Verify fuel inventories and adjust logistics to ensure timely refueling and source item delivery to burner devices.\n\n\u2022 Power Network Connectivity Issues  \n  - Several steam engines and lab units report being \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d or are flagged with NO_POWER status.  \n  - Mitigation: Reevaluate and reinforce electrical connections by repositioning power poles and reconfiguring wiring to integrate critical structures reliably into the power network."}
