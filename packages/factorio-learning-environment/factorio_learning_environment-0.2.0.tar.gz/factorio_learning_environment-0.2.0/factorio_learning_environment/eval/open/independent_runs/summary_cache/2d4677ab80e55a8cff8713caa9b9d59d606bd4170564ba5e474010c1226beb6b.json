{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbors: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (74 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place a Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, or Transport Belt. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Furnace Setup Errors\n- Verify the setup of the furnace to ensure it has the necessary ingredients and fuel to produce iron plates. This includes checking that the furnace is connected to a source of iron ore and has sufficient fuel.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drill\n- Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill. This will prevent the drill's output from being blocked by items on the ground.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
