{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently working with an inventory of 48 Iron Ore and 100 Iron Plates. It has warnings indicating that the furnace result is full.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0) which is currently working but has no fuel. Its inventory is empty.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) with an inventory of 636 Coal.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) which is waiting for source items, with an inventory of 18 Coal.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) which is waiting for space in the destination, with an inventory of 1 Coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently working but has no fuel. Its inventory is empty.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with an inventory of 58 Iron Ore.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) and Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that stores Iron Ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting items into entities with full inventory**: Ensure that the furnace or chest has available space before attempting to insert items. The stone furnace is currently full of output.\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**: Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it.\n- **Errors related to fuel**: Ensure that the burner mining drill has sufficient fuel before attempting to operate it. The burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0) is currently out of fuel.\n- **Errors when trying to insert items from an empty inventory**: Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. The agent encountered an error when trying to insert coal from an empty inventory.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined**:\n  - `insert_item(prototype, entity, quantity)`: Used to insert items into entities. Encountered failures when trying to insert coal due to an empty inventory.\n  \n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill_1`: BurnerMiningDrill\n  - `burner_mining_drill_2`: BurnerMiningDrill\n  - `inserted_coal_1`: Inventory\n  - `inserted_coal_2`: Inventory\n  - `quantity`: int\n\nThis report summarizes the current structures, errors encountered, and utility functions defined by the agent, providing a comprehensive overview of the agent's activities and challenges in the game."}
