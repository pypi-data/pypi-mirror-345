{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with fuel (coal: 18) and status (no ingredients to smelt).\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (2, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (2, 0)) with fuel (coal: 7) and status (no ingredients to smelt).\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 0.5)) with inventory (copper-plate: 4).\n\n### Lab at position (0, 1)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position (0, 1)) with lab input (automation-science-pack: 160) and status (no power, research: automation).\n\n### Electricity Group at position (5.5, 4.5), (1.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (5.5, 4.5), (1.5, 1.5), and (2.5, 2.5) providing power to the lab and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting Assembling Machine\n- The recipe for assembling-machine-1 is not unlocked yet (requires automation technology). Research the required technology before attempting to craft.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to place is available in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, a small electric pole was not found in the inventory when trying to place it at various positions.\n- Cannot place small-electric-pole at the target location if something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable (e.g., water). Check the target location before placing.\n\n### Errors when accessing entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. For example, a lab was not found at the specified position (0, 1) and a steam engine was not found at (1, -1).\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that your lab and other electrical entities are connected to a power source. The lab is currently showing a status of no power.\n\n### NameError in code\n- Check for proper naming of classes and variables in your code. For instance, 'Electric' was not defined, indicating a possible typo or incorrect reference.\n\n### Errors when moving to positions\n- Ensure that the position you are trying to move to is valid and accessible. Errors occurred due to attempting to move to positions that resulted in 'AttributeError: 'BoundingBox' object has no attribute 'x''.\n\n### Errors related to electricity status\n- Ensure that the electricity group and its poles are properly connected to the power network. The pole at (2.5, 2.5) is currently showing a status of NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK.\n- Check for proper attributes when accessing electricity-related properties. For example, 'ElectricityGroup' object has no attribute 'energy', indicating a possible error in accessing the object's properties."}
