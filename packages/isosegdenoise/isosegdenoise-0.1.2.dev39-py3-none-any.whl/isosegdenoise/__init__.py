'''
This sister package to PalmettoBUG handles Segmentation and Denoising. This is because Deepcell (and possibly Cellpose) have non-commercial 
licenses that might conflict with the necessary GPL'ing of the PalmettoBUG program (although as the packages are only dynamically linked by 
the interpreter on an individual basis by users when initialize the program, this is a legal grey area).  

PalmettoBUG uses many GPL libraries both in the standard way and by translation, so it MUST be GPL-licensed.
