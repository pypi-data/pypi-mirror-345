{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Station at position(0,0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions(0,0) and (2,0) for smelting iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position(0.5,-1.5) feeding iron ore into first furnace\n- Burner inserter at position(2.5,-1.5) feeding iron ore into second furnace\nBoth furnaces have coal fuel and are currently idle waiting for iron ore input.\n\n### Automated Coal Mining Station at position(41,-82)\nAn automated coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(41,-82) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at position(41.5,-80.5) collecting mined coal\n- Burner inserter at position(41.5,-79.5) oriented upward\nThe system is operational with the drill actively mining coal and storing it in the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at position(-18,-53)\nAn automated iron ore mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-18,-53) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at position(-17.5,-51.5) collecting mined iron ore\nThe system is operational with the drill actively mining iron ore.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nMultiple belt groups connecting the iron ore mining station towards the smelting area:\n- Belt group from (-17.5,-51.5) to (-13.5,-44.5)\n- Belt group from (-17.5,-50.5) to (-12.5,-46.5)\n- Belt group from (-16.5,-51.5) to (-10.5,-47.5)\n- Belt group from (-9.5,-49.5) to (-7.5,-44.5)\n- Belt group from (-6.5,-46.5) to (-5.5,-42.5)\n- Belt group from (-4.5,-42.5) to (-5.5,-36.5)\n- Belt group from (-4.5,-36.5) to (-4.5,-30.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collisions\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces, ensure proper spacing and consider the furnace dimensions\n- Use appropriate spacing parameters when using place_entity_next_to function to avoid collisions with existing structures\n\n### Resource Management\n- Maintain sufficient iron plates in inventory before attempting to craft items requiring them\n- Keep track of coal levels and refuel machines before they run out\n- Ensure you have transport belts in inventory before attempting to connect entities with belts\n\n### Crafting System Understanding\n- For items requiring machine crafting or smelting (like iron plates), ensure they are produced in appropriate facilities first\n- Plan crafting sequences to maintain required ingredients for multi-step crafting processes\n\n### Belt Connection Issues\n- Verify you have enough transport belts in inventory before attempting to create belt connections\n- When connecting distant entities with belts, calculate the total belt requirement beforehand\n\n### Entity Configuration\n- When setting up automated systems, verify correct orientation of inserters and other directional entities\n- Consider the input/output positions of entities when designing automated systems"}
