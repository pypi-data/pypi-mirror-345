{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all necessary entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inefficient Resource Processing\n- The furnace frequently reports \"no ingredients to smelt.\" Ensure that iron ore is consistently supplied to the furnace to avoid production halts. Check the alignment and operation of inserters and ensure they are properly transferring materials from chests to furnaces.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- The chest at the mining drill's drop position is often full, which halts mining operations. Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent it from becoming a bottleneck in resource extraction.\n\n### Repeated Inserter Alignment\n- The inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) is frequently repositioned. Once aligned, ensure it remains in the correct position to reduce unnecessary adjustments and maintain a steady flow of materials."}
