{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Location**: Position(x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n- **Components**:\n  - **Stone Furnace** at Position(x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n    - Status: Working, but with a full output warning indicating that the furnace result inventory is full.\n    - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n    - Source Inventory: Iron Ore (45 units)\n    - Result Inventory: Iron Plate (100 units)\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\n- **Location**: Position(x=42.0, y=-83.0) to Position(x=43.5, y=-79.5)\n- **Components**:\n  - **Burner Mining Drill** at Position(x=42.0, y=-83.0)\n    - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n    - Status: Working, with a warning that the output is blocked by an item on the ground.\n    - Neighbours: Connected to a transport belt and a burner inserter.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n    - Fuel: Coal (50 units)\n    - Status: Waiting for source items, with a warning that the chest is full.\n    - Neighbours: Connected to the burner mining drill and transport belts.\n  - **BeltGroup** connecting from Position(x=42.5, y=-82.5) to Position(x=43.5, y=-79.5)\n    - Consists of 7 belts, facilitating the transport of mined resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items like transport belts.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- **Transport Belts**: Ensure the intended position is clear and not obstructed before placing transport belts.\n- **Wooden Chests**: Verify the intended position is not obstructed or occupied by another entity before placing wooden chests.\n- **Inserters**: Check that the intended position for inserters is clear and suitable for placement.\n\n### Connection Verification Failures\n- **Transport Belts**: Ensure that all segments of the transport belt are correctly aligned and connected. Clear any obstructions that may prevent successful connections.\n\n### Obstruction Issues\n- Regularly clear obstructions in the path of your entities to ensure smooth operation and placement of new entities.\n\n### Output Blockages\n- Address warnings of blocked outputs by ensuring there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest) to accept the output from production entities like mining drills and furnaces."}
