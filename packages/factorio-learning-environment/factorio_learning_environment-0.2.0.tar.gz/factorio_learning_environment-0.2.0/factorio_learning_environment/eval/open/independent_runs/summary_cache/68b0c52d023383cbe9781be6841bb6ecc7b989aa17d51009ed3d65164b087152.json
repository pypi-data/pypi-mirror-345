{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been created or updated in the given steps.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using incorrect attribute access\n- Ensure that when accessing attributes of an object, the correct attribute names are used. For example, using `item.value` when `item` is a string will result in an `AttributeError`. Verify the object's type and available attributes before attempting to access them.\n\n### Errors with non-working entities\n- Investigate entities that are not functioning as expected. Ensure they have the necessary resources and are correctly connected to the power supply or other required inputs. For example, furnaces without ingredients will not operate, so ensure they are supplied with the necessary materials.\n\n### Errors with empty pickup positions\n- Verify that the positions you are attempting to pick up items from contain the expected resources. If a position is empty, check upstream processes to ensure they are functioning correctly and supplying the necessary items."}
