{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n- Electricity network with poles at positions (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5)\n\n### Research Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to the power supply\n- Lab is currently working on Logistics research\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Research Setup\n- Ensure that research prerequisites are met before attempting to start research.\n- Verify that the lab is correctly supplied with the necessary science packs and connected to power.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in inventory to refuel the boiler consistently. Regularly check and harvest coal to prevent power outages.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement and Connection\n- Ensure all entities, such as boilers and steam engines, are correctly connected to their respective networks (pipes, electricity) to function properly. Regularly check connections to avoid disruptions in power and fluid supply."}
