{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (65 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the desired location is free of other entities or items before attempting to place a Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, or Transport Belt.\n\n### Errors with furnace setup\n- Verify the furnace setup to ensure it has the necessary ingredients to produce iron plates. Check that the furnace is correctly connected to the mining drill and has sufficient fuel and raw materials.\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage. Consider placing a transport belt or chest to collect the output.\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Check the placement of Burner Inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities."}
