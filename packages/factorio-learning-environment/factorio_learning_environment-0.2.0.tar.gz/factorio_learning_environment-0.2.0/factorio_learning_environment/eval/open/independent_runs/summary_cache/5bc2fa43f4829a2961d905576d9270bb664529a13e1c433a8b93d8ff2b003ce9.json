{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates/cables. (Current state: fuel remaining coal: 31, iron-plate output available, warning \"no ingredients to smelt\" persists.)\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the output from the furnace. (Current state: chest inventory remains empty due to insertion issues.)\n- Burner inserter at position (48.5, -81.5) placed adjacent to the furnace and rotated to drop items at (49.5, -81.5); it continues to register a waiting warning for source items.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Insertion Failures into Targeted Containers\n- Ensure correct referencing and validation of container inventory immediately after insertion. Verify the container\u2019s acceptance and update its inventory before proceeding with subsequent insertions.\n- Investigate reasons for repeated insertion failures into the chest to eliminate assertion errors during both initial and re-insertion attempts.\n\n### Inventory and API Argument Management\n- Continually confirm sufficient inventory levels and accurate entity references during API calls to prevent repeated argument type or assertion errors.\n  \n### Entity Placement and Tile Occupation\n- No new placement errors were reported; continue checking that target tiles remain unoccupied prior to placement operations.\n\n### Fuel and Entity State Management\n- Maintain monitoring of operational states of processing structures (fuel levels, warnings, and source item availability) to avoid delays in production."}
