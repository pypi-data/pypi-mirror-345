{"content": "I notice the mining drill is showing a warning: \"waiting for space in destination as the output is full. Place a sink object at (-18.5, 21.5) to unblock.\"\n\nLet's fix this by placing a chest to collect the output:\n\n```python\n# First check what we need for a burner mining drill\nrecipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\nprint(f\"Recipe for burner mining drill: {recipe}\")\n\n# Check our current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Move to the mining drill's drop position\nmove_to(Position(x=-18.5, y=21.5))\nprint(\"Moved to drill's output position\")\n\n# Place a chest to collect the iron ore\nchest = place_entity(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    position=Position(x=-18.5, y=21.5),\n    direction=Direction.UP\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at: {chest.position}\")\n\n# Check if the mining drill is now working\ndrill = get_entities_filtered(name=\"burner-mining-drill\")[0]\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Mining drill warnings: {drill.warnings}\")\nprint(f\"Chest inventory: {chest.inventory if chest else 'No chest'}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Move to where the drill needs its output collected\n2. Place a chest there to collect the iron ore\n3. Check if this resolves the drill's blocked status\n\nLet me know if you want me to try a different approach or if you see any other issues.", "summary_range": "[1-2634]"}
