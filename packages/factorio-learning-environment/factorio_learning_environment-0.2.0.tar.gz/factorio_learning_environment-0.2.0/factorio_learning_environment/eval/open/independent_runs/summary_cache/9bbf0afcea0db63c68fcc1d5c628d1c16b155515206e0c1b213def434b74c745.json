{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) connected to a boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) with pipes.\n\n### Pipe Group at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\nConsists of pipes connecting the following positions:\n- (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n- (x=-11.5, y=21.5)\n- (x=-11.5, y=22.5)\n- (x=-10.5, y=22.5)\n- (x=-10.5, y=23.5)\n- (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Group at Position (-4.115, 20.167)\nConsists of electric poles at various positions, currently not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace with a fuel inventory of coal and producing iron plates. Currently has warnings for no ingredients to smelt and a full fuel source.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is placed adjacent to a water source. The agent repeatedly failed to find a suitable position for the offshore pump.\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Placement\n- Verify that the boiler and steam engine are placed on suitable tiles. The agent attempted to place these entities on unsuitable positions multiple times.\n\n### Connection Errors between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Ensure proper alignment and connection between the offshore pump and boiler using pipes. The agent failed to connect these entities correctly.\n\n### Electric Pole Connection Issues\n- Check the placement and connectivity of electric poles to ensure they are part of the electric network. The agent encountered issues connecting electric poles due to placement problems.\n\n### Errors with Entity Pickup\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that the second argument is a Position object. The agent encountered a ValueError due to incorrect usage of this function."}
