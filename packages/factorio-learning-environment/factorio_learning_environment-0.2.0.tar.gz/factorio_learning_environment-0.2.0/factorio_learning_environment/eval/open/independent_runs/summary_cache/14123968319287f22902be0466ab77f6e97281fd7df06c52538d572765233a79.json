{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), pipe (position -9.5, 22.5), and pipe (position -9.5, 23.5). The offshore pump is used to draw water from the sea for the steam engine.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (1, 1)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with coal as fuel and producing copper plates.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 1.5) storing iron plates.\n- Lab (position 6.5, 1.5) for research purposes.\n- Furnace (position 10.0, 1.0) with iron ore as input but currently out of fuel.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) transferring items between the lab and the furnace.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 3.5) storing iron plates.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 5.5) currently empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any entities or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water).\n- If you encounter a \"Cannot place small-electric-pole\" error, check the surrounding area for obstructions.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Confirm that the entity you are trying to retrieve (e.g., steam engine) exists at the specified position. If you receive an error stating \"No entity of type steam-engine found at the specified position,\" verify the coordinates and ensure the entity has not been removed or misplaced.\n\n### Errors when checking for resources\n- When checking for resources (e.g., water), ensure that the specified coordinates contain the resource. If you receive an error stating \"No water at the specified location,\" consider moving to a different location where water is present."}
