{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and extracting iron ore. It has a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5) which is currently full.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore, currently has 224 units of iron ore.\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and producing iron plates. It has a furnace result inventory containing 99 iron plates.\n- The furnace is connected to the Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5) through the insertion of iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**\n  - The Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) cannot continue mining because the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Empty the chest to allow for continued mining.\n\n- **Repeated actions without updates**\n  - The agent has repeatedly executed the same actions (refueling, extracting, inserting) without making progress. Ensure to check the status of entities before repeating actions to avoid redundancy.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Entity of type BurnerMiningDrill located at (-15.0, -50.0).\n  - `wooden_chest`: Entity of type Chest located at (-14.5, -48.5).\n  - `stone_furnace`: Entity of type Furnace located at (0.0, 0.0).\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary type containing items in the agent's inventory, currently `{'wood': 4}`."}
