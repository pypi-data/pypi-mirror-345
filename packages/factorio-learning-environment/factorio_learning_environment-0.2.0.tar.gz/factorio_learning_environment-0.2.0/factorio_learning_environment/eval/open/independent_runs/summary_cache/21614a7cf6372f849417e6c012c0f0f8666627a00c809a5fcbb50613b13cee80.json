{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and transfers it to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5) which is aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to a furnace. The inserter is fueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) which is intended to smelt the iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving iron ore due to alignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position if there is a collision with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest and the drop position aligns with the furnace. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items.\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- When placing an inserter, ensure there is no collision with existing entities and the area is suitable for placement. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position as necessary.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly aligned and operational to transfer ingredients into the furnace."}
