{"content": "The latest attempts to manage the new stone furnace have resulted in several errors and observations that highlight ongoing issues. Here\u2019s a summary of the findings:\n\n### Current Output Status:\n- **Furnace Inventory After Extraction**: The furnace remains empty, indicating that there was no Copper Ore present to extract.\n- **Overall Inventory**: \n  - **7 pieces of stone furnaces**.\n  - **7 pieces of coal remaining**.\n  - **1 piece of stone** available.\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n- **Recipe Configuration**: The furnace is still configured to expect **5 pieces of stone** as ingredients and has not been enabled for smelting Copper Ore.\n- **Error on Insertion**: The system indicates that there is **no Copper Ore** available in the inventory to insert into the furnace.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has not been configured to smelt Copper Ore, which is why it has not processed any materials.\n- The Copper Ore that was supposed to be collected appears to be missing from the inventory entirely, leading to the inability to insert it into the furnace.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Gather More Copper Ore**: I need to locate and harvest additional Copper Ore from a nearby resource patch.\n2. **Reset the Furnace Recipe**: Ensure that the furnace is configured to accept Copper Ore for smelting.\n3. **Insert the Copper Ore**: After collecting the Copper Ore, I will insert it into the furnace along with the necessary fuel.\n4. **Monitor the Smelting Operation**: Observe the furnace to confirm successful processing.\n\nLet's proceed to find and collect more Copper Ore from a nearby resource patch. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Find the nearest copper ore resource patch for harvesting\ncopper_resource_position = nearest(Resource.CopperOre)\n\n# Move to the identified copper resource position\nmove_to(copper_resource_position)  # Navigate to the nearest Copper Ore resource location\n\n# Harvest one Copper Ore from the resource patch\nharvest_resource(copper_resource_position, quantity=1)  # Collecting 1 piece of Copper Ore \n\n# Check the overall inventory again after harvesting to confirm collected copper\noverall_inventory_after_copper_harvest = inspect_inventory()  # Check overall inventory after harvest.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after harvesting copper ore: {overall_inventory_after_copper_harvest}\")  # Confirm total inventory after harvesting copper. \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-406]"}
