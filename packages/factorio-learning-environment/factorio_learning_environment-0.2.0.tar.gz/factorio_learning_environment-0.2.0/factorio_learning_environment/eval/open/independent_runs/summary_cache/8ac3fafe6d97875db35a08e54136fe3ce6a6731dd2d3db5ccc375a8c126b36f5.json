Transport belts must not be connected directly to entities such as Steam Engines or Assembling Machines.\n\n\u2022 Pickup Area Conflicts:\n\u2003- Verify that pickup positions (e.g., for target inserters) are free from interfering objects like wooden chests. When removal is necessary, use proper parameter calls to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n\u2022 Waypoint Alignment and Segmentation:\n\u2003- Ensure that all intermediate waypoints are grid-aligned and form a continuous path. Splitting long segments into shorter, defined sections helps avoid path normalisation issues.\n\n\u2022 Parameter Validation in Entity Operations:\n\u2003- Use correct argument types for functions that retrieve or remove interfering entities to prevent ValueErrors and similar parameter mismatches.\n\nNote: No user\u2010defined functions were introduced in these steps."}
