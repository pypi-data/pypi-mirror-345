{"content": "I see several issues that need addressing:\n\n1. The mining drill at (-15.0, 23.0) has a full chest at its output\n2. The mining drill at (-11.0, 25.0) has no fuel\n3. We have a blocked inserter at (-11.5, 27.5)\n\nLet's fix these issues one by one:\n\n```python\n# First, let's add fuel to the empty mining drill\nmove_to(Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0))\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0), quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to mining drill\")\n\n# Now let's clear the full chest by adding an inserter to move items onto a belt\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.5, y=21.5))\n\n# Place a transport belt next to the chest\nbelt = place_entity(\n    Prototype.TransportBelt,\n    position=Position(x=-14.5, y=21.5),\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n    exact=True\n)\n\nif belt:\n    print(f\"Placed transport belt next to chest\")\n    \n    # Add an inserter to move items from chest to belt\n    inserter = place_entity(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n        position=Position(x=-15.5, y=20.5),\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT\n    )\n    \n    if inserter:\n        print(f\"Placed inserter to empty chest\")\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n        print(f\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Verify the setup\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Current entities: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Add fuel to the empty mining drill\n2. Add an inserter to move items from the full chest onto a transport belt\n3. Connect the transport belt to our existing belt system", "summary_range": "[1-624]"}
