This includes checking for overlapping entities or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities at specific positions\n- Verify the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. If the entity does not exist, adjust the position or ensure the entity is placed correctly.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities without available items\n- Confirm that the required items are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This avoids errors related to missing items.\n\n### Errors related to blocked output of entities\n- Ensure that there is a valid sink entity or storage available to accept the output from entities like drills or furnaces to prevent blockage and inefficiency.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Check that the new location is suitable and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity there. This includes ensuring there is no obstruction or overlap with other entities."}
