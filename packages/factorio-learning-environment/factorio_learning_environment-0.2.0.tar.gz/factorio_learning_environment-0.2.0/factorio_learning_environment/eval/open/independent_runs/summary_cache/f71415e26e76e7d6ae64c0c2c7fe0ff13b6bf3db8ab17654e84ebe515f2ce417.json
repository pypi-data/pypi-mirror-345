{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) to another Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) for iron ore extraction and processing.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items to transfer from the Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Multiple inserters are waiting for source items at various positions. Ensure that the source entities have the necessary items available for the inserters to transfer. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- The chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) is full, preventing further mining operations. Regularly empty the chest to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.
