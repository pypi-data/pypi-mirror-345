{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (42.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Iron Chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-11.5, -49.5), (-10.5, -49.5), and (-8.5, -49.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-11.5, -45.5) and (-10.5, -45.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) for transferring items into storage chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that the upstream supply of items is consistent and sufficient to prevent inserters from idling. Check the supply chain feeding into inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5).\n\n### Full Chests Blocking Mining Operations\n- Regularly clear out full chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations. Specifically, monitor the chest at (41.5, -80.5) for coal and (-14.5, -48.5) for iron ore.\n\n### Furnace Output Blocked\n- Ensure that the output of furnaces is not blocked by full inventories. Regularly transfer smelted items from furnaces to prevent stoppages."}
