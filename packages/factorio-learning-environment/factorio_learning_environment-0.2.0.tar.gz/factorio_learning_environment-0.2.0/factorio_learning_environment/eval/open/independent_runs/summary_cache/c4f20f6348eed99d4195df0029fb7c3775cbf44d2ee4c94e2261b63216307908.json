Check if the output chest is full and empty it if necessary.\n\n### Errors when Supplying Iron Ore to Furnaces\n- Verify that you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces. Ensure that the source inventory contains the necessary items.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied. Check for existing objects that might obstruct placement and choose a suitable location.\n\n### Errors when Transferring to Non-existent Entities\n- Confirm the presence of the target entity at the specified position before attempting a transfer. Ensure that the entity type and position are correct to avoid transfer failures."}
