{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at position (2.0, -63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (2.0, -63.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (4.0, -63.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (6.0, -63.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (3.5, -61.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnaces.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (2.5, -61.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (4.5, -61.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors related to crafting without required resources\n- Ensure you have the necessary raw resources (e.g., wood) before attempting to craft items like wooden chests. Wood must be harvested from trees before crafting.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Verify that the source entity (e.g., chest, furnace) contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting extraction. For example, ensure the furnace has iron plates before extracting them.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required entity (e.g., wooden chest) before attempting to place it on the map.\n\n#### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Ensure the entity (e.g., wooden chest) exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it.\n\n#### Errors due to full inventory\n- Manage your inventory space carefully. Ensure you have enough space before attempting to pick up items or extract resources.\n\n#### Errors when extracting from invalid entities\n- Confirm that the entity (e.g., furnace) is valid and contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting extraction."}
