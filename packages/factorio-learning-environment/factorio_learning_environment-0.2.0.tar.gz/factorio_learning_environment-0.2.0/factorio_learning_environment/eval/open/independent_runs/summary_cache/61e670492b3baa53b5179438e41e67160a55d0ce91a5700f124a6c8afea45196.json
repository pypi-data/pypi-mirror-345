{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure you have iron ore before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full inventories. For instance, empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to continue mining coal, and the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) for iron ore.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady supply of resources to the source entity."}
