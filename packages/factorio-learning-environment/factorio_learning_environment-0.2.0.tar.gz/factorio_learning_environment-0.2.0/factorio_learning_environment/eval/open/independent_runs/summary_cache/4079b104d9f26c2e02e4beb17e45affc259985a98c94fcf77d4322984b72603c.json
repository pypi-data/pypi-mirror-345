{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to a furnace. The inserter is positioned to pick up from (-12.5, -48.5) and drop at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a tile before attempting placement. Avoid placing entities where there might be collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water).\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. If an inserter is not functioning as expected, check its pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly set.\n\n### Inserter Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel inserters to maintain their operation. Ensure that inserters have sufficient fuel to avoid interruptions in item transfer processes.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter feeding the furnace is correctly positioned and operational to deliver iron ore. Check that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt, and adjust inserter alignment if the furnace is not receiving materials."}
