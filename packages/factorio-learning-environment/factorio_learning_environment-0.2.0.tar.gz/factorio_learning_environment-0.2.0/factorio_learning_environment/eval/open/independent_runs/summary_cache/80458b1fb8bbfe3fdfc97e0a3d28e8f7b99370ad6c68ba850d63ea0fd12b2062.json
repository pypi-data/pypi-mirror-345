{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction Structure at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator at position(-4.5, 0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5), boiler at position (-7.5, 0.0), steam engine at position (-4.5, 0.5) and a pipe group connecting them at positions [(-6.5, -2.5), (-4.5, -2.5), (-5.5, -2.5), (-6.5, -1.5), (-7.5, -1.5)]\n\n### Power Distribution Structure\nConsists of small electric poles at various positions including (-2.5, 1.5), (13.5, 17.5), (15.5, 19.5), (18.5, 36.5), (21.5, 35.5), (15.5, 36.5), (4.5, 38.5), (15.5, 39.5) connecting the steam engine to the pumpjack and oil refinery\n\n### Oil Processing Structure at position(7.5, 40.5)\nConsists of oil refinery at position (7.5, 40.5) and a pipe group connecting pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) to oil refinery at positions [(11.5, 39.5), (12.5, 39.5), (12.5, 38.5), ..., (9.5, 43.5), (10.5, 43.5), (10.5, 42.5)]\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied or unplaceable positions:\n  - Ensure the target position is clear of other entities and is not part of unplaceable terrain (such as water) before attempting to place a new entity.\n* Errors when using non-existent or misplaced entities:\n  - Verify that the entity you are trying to use or connect to exists and is correctly positioned.\n* Errors when entities are not receiving power:\n  - Ensure that the entity is connected to a power source and that the power network is functioning correctly.\n* Errors due to undefined functions or variables:\n  - Ensure that all functions and variables are defined before they are used in the code. For example, 'to' is not defined.\n* Errors when connecting entities with pipes:\n  - Ensure that the connection points of the entities are not blocked and are correctly aligned.\n* Errors when using incorrect arguments for functions:\n  - Check the function documentation to ensure the correct number and types of arguments are being passed. For example, the error in Step 40 and Step 46 suggests an incorrect argument was passed to a function.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs. Therefore, this section is not included in the report."}
