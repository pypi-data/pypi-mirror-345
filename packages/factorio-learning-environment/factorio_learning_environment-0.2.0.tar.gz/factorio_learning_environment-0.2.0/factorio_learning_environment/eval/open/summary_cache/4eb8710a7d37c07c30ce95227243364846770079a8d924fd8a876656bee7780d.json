{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered via connected poles but output blocked due to no sink entity.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used to smelt iron ore mined by the drill.\n- Wooden chest at position (19.5, 75.5) placed to store iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (20.5, 75.5) to move iron plates from furnace to chest.\n- Small electric poles connecting the electric mining drill and furnace area to the power network (some placement attempts failed due to collisions).\n\n### Steam power generation at position around (-9.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal to produce steam.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) consuming steam to generate electricity.\n- Small electric poles placed near boiler (at -4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (at 0.5, 3.5) to distribute power.\n- Pipes connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine forming a working fluid system.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement collisions and spacing issues\n- Attempts to place wooden chest at (19.5, 75.5) failed because an entity already exists there. Solution: Check for existing entities before placement or choose a different position.\n- Attempts to place burner inserter next to furnace at (18.0, 75.0) failed due to chest occupying the adjacent tile. Solution: Increase spacing, change placement direction, or reposition reference entity.\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near furnace failed multiple times due to collisions with existing entities like the electric mining drill. Solution: Increase spacing, try alternative directions, or reposition reference entity to avoid overlaps.\n\n### Power connection and status errors\n- Electric mining drill initially reported no power and was not receiving electricity. After connecting poles to the steam power network, drill status changed to waiting for output space, indicating power is now supplied but output is blocked.\n- Error caused by accessing non-existent attribute 'energy' on ElectricityGroup object when filtering power sources. Solution: Use correct attributes or methods to check power availability on electric poles or power sources.\n\n### Fuel and resource management\n- Boiler ran out of fuel at one point causing it to stop producing steam. Solution: Ensure continuous insertion of coal or other fuel to boilers.\n- Inserter placed to move iron plates was waiting for source items, indicating possible timing or resource flow issues to be monitored.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
