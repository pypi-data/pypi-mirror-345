{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Iron ore is transferred to these furnaces for smelting into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution at Position (47.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Multiple iron chests at positions (47.5, -80.5), (49.5, -80.5), and others for coal storage.\n- Inserters and chests are used to manage coal distribution.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Iron Chests and Wooden Chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), and others for iron ore storage.\n- Iron ore is mined and stored in nearby chests for further processing.\n\n### Coal-Powered Inserter System at Position (43.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and others\n- Iron Chests at positions (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), and others\n- This system is used to manage the transfer of items between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace outputs are clear before attempting to extract items. If extraction fails, check for any blockages or full inventories.\n\n### Errors when Refueling Inserters\n- Make sure inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Refuel them regularly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and clear chests that are full to prevent mining drills and other entities from halting operations due to lack of storage space.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Ensure that connected chests have the necessary items for inserters to function. If an inserter is not working, verify that the chest contains the required resources."}
