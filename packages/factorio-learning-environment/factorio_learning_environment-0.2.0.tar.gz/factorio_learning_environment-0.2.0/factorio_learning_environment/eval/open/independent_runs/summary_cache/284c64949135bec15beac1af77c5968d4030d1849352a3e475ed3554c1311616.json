{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - working, producing water\n- Boiler (x=-6.5, y=0.0) - still out of fuel (status: NO_FUEL)\n- Steam engine (x=-2.5, y=0.5) - connected to power network but steam connection issues\n- Pipe network (system 6104) connecting pump and boiler\n- Pipe network (system 6101) carrying steam to engine (connection issues)\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - operational with crude oil resources\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - powered but with fluid ingredient shortage\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - contains 172.38 petroleum gas\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - still misconfigured (output blocked)\n- Wooden chest with coal (x=37.5, y=37.5) - contains 47 coal\n- Connected pipe networks:\n  - System 6127: crude oil transport\n  - System 6130: petroleum gas transport\n  - System 6140: incomplete connection to chemical plant\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent power system issues\n- Boiler fuel depletion (steps 79-87):\n  - Current fuel level: empty\n  - Refill with coal from chest (x=37.5, y=37.5)\n  - Monitor fuel consumption rate\n\n### Chemical plant placement failures\n- Repeated placement attempts at water tiles (steps 80, 81, 87):\n  - Failed positions: (37.5,40.5) and (40.5,42.5)\n  - Verify terrain is land before placement\n  - Use map preview before placing\n\n### Fluid connection problems\n- Steam engine connection issues (steps 84-86):\n  - Current connection point: x=-6.5 y=-1.5 (wrong fluid type)\n  - Verify correct steam pipe connection to x=-2.5 y=-2.0\n  - Check fluid directions and connection points\n\n### Power pole placement failures\n- Repeated pole placement attempts (steps 81-82):\n  - Missing poles at x=20.0 y=0.0 through x=35.0 y=0.0\n  - Inventory shows 450 small-electric-pole available\n  - Verify terrain is clear before placement\n\n### Inserter misconfiguration\n- Still incorrectly dropping items (step 87):\n  - Current drop position: x=37.5 y=39.5 (empty ground)\n  - Change direction from DOWN to UP\n  - Verify target entity exists before configuring\n\n### Previous errors still applicable:\n- Entity access validation (confirm existence before interaction)\n- Production chain sequencing (complete petroleum gas flow)\n- Placement distance verification (move within 10 tiles)\n- Fluid system validation (check connection points and fluid types)"}
