{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup (around x=-2, y=-76)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-2.0, y=-76.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace (x=-1.0, y=-74.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Iron ore mining drill is working but output is blocked due to missing collection system\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Smelting Setup (around x=-21, y=-73)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-21.0, y=-73.0) mining copper ore\n- Iron chest (x=-21.5, y=-74.5) collecting copper ore (currently contains 309 copper ore)\n- Burner inserter (x=-20.5, y=-74.5) moving items from chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace (x=-19.0, y=-74.0) for smelting copper ore (currently full with 100 copper plates)\n\n### Advanced Processing Line (around x=1.5 to x=7.5, y=-75 to y=-71)\nComplex production line consisting of:\n- Iron chest (x=1.5, y=-74.5) containing 163 iron plates\n- Multiple burner inserters and stone furnaces in sequence:\n  - Stone furnace at (x=3.0, y=-73.0)\n  - Stone furnace at (x=5.0, y=-73.0)\n- Collection chests:\n  - Iron chest (x=3.5, y=-75.5) containing 50 iron plates\n  - Iron chest (x=7.5, y=-72.5) containing 18 iron plates\n  - Iron chest (x=3.5, y=-71.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting various parts:\n  - Belt group from y=-74.5 to y=-72.5\n  - Belt group from y=-71.5 to y=-69.5\n  - Belt group connecting x=2.5 to x=0.5 at y=-71.5\n  - Belt group from x=0.5 to x=7.5 at y=-70.5\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity or item\n- When placing chests or other entities, ensure the target position is clear of items on ground and other structures\n\n### Mining Drill Output Issues\n- Ensure mining drills have a proper output collection system (chest or belt) placed at their output position\n- Current iron ore mining drill is blocked because there's no collection entity at its output position\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- Multiple furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n- Ensure proper item flow through the production line by checking inserter connections and belt layouts"}
