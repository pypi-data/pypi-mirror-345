{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. Although several steps attempted to craft and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), all such efforts failed due to inventory and resource issues. The agent did interact with existing resource\u2010processing facilities (for example, a furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) used for iron smelting and a furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) used for copper smelting), but these were retrieved from the environment rather than constructed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Usage Errors  \n  - When invoking get_entities, ensure the function signature is followed. Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and supplying extraneous positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Verification  \n  - Confirm that the necessary item (e.g., Lab) exists in the inventory before attempting to place it. Use pre-placement checks to verify resource availability.\n\n\u2022 Handling None-type Returns  \n  - Check for None when processing the results of functions like get_entities. Default to an empty list if no entities are returned to avoid iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Resource and Crafting Planning  \n  - For complex recipes (such as Lab crafting), pre-calculate required sub-ingredients (iron\u2011gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper\u2011cable, etc.) and ensure production chains are in place. Supplement resource production (through smelting or otherwise) to meet these prerequisites before initiating crafting.\n\n\u2022 Comprehensive Error Handling  \n  - Group similar issues\u2014such as API misuse, inventory shortages, and resource insufficiencies\u2014and implement early validation steps to prevent cascading failures in subsequent operations."}
