{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) that puts items into the Assembling Machine\n- Belt group connecting the Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Storage Facility at Position (-3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) transferring items to another Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Non-existent Entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists and contains the item you are trying to extract. For example, attempting to extract copper cable from an Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) failed because the entity did not contain the item.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Ingredients in Assembling Machines\n- Make sure all required ingredients are available in the assembling machine before starting the crafting process. The Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) could not create copper cable due to missing copper plates.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
