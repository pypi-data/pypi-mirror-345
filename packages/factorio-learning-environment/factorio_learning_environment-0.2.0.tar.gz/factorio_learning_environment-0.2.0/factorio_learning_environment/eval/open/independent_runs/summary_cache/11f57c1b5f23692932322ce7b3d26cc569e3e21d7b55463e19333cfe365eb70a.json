{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5) - connected to pipe network 9040 (water)\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=0.0) - contains 27 coal, connected to pipe network 9040\n- Pipe-to-ground connection (x=-6.5, y=-1.5) - disconnected\n- Additional boiler (x=-6.5, y=10.0) - contains 7 coal, connected to pipe network 9046\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=9.5) - connected to pipe network 9046 (water)\n- Pipe networks:\n  - System 9040: water transport between x=-8.5 to x=-7.5\n  - System 9046: water transport between x=-8.5 to x=-8.5\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - operational but no power\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - no power, configured for basic oil processing\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - operational\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - misconfigured (drops to ground), no power\n- Wooden chest (x=37.5, y=37.5) - empty\n- Connected pipe networks:\n  - System 9067: petroleum gas transport\n  - System 9068: crude oil transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent inventory management issues\n- Missing items during operations (steps 96, 99, 103):\n  - No coal when attempting to insert into boiler\n  - No offshore pumps in inventory when attempting placement\n  - Verify inventory before attempting operations\n\n### Entity access failures\n- Non-existent entity access attempts (steps 97, 102):\n  - Chemical plant at x=50,y=50 doesn't exist\n  - Steam engine at x=-2.5,y=0.5 doesn't exist\n  - Verify entity existence before interaction\n\n### API usage errors\n- Incorrect function parameter usage (step 98):\n  - Wrong number of arguments for nearest() function\n  - Review API documentation for correct parameter counts\n\n### Fluid connection problems\n- Connection validation failures (step 100):\n  - Offshore pump to boiler connection blocked\n  - Verify clear path between connection points\n  - Check fluid types match between connected entities\n\n### Power system issues\n- Persistent power distribution problems:\n  - Pumpjack and refinery remain without power\n  - Inserter at x=37.5,y=38.5 has no power\n  - Connect all production buildings to power grid\n\n### Recommended actions:\n1. Replenish offshore pump inventory\n2. Verify and fix all power connections\n3. Check API documentation for correct function usage\n4. Validate all fluid system connections\n5. Ensure inventory has required items before operations"}
