For example, copper-plates are required to craft copper-cables.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace you are trying to extract from contains the item you wish to extract. If the furnace is empty or does not contain the specified item, extraction will fail.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. If you do not have the item (e.g., coal), the insertion will fail.\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items into non-existent entities\n- Make sure that there is a valid entity nearby that can accept the item you are trying to insert.
