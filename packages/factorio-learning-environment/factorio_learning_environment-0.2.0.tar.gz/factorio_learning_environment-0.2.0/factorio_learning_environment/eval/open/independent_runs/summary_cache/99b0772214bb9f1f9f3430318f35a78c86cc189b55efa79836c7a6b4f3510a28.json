{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-3.0, 1.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-1.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-0.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) also storing iron plates.\n\n### Belt Transport System\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- Belt Group 1: Connects from (x=-0.5, y=-0.5) to (x=1.5, y=-0.5) and from (x=0.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=1.5), facilitating movement of items.\n- Belt Group 2: Connects from (x=2.5, y=0.5) to (x=2.5, y=-1.5) and from (x=2.5, y=-0.5) to (x=4.5, y=-0.5), facilitating movement of items.\n- Belt Group 3: Connects from (x=0.5, y=2.5) to (x=2.5, y=2.5) and from (x=1.5, y=1.5) to (x=3.5, y=1.5), facilitating movement of items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when picking up entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to pick up exists at the specified position. In the logs, attempts to pick up a transport belt at position (-2, 1) failed because no belt was present there.\n\n### Inserter Functionality Issues\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and have access to source items. Several logs indicate that the inserter was not functioning properly due to misalignment or lack of source items.\n\n### Furnace Output Blockage\n- Regularly check and clear any blockages at the furnace output to ensure continuous production of iron plates. Logs indicate repeated issues with furnace output blockages."}
