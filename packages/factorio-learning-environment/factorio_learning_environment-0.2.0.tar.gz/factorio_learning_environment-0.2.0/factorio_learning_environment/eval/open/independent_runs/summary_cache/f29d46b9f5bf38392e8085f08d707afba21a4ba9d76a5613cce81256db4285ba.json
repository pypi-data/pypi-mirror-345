{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and actively mining iron ore.\n  - Connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) which stores the mined iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) moves iron ore from the chest to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt System**\n  - Connects the mining drill's output to the furnace.\n  - **BeltGroup** consists of 75 belts, moving items from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) and from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) moves iron ore into the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors related to full storage entities\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to avoid warnings and interruptions in production, such as \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item exists in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **mining_drill**: Represents the burner mining drill entity, used for mining operations.\n- **furnace**: Represents the stone furnace entity, used for smelting operations.\n- **inventory**: A dictionary holding the current inventory state, e.g., `{'wood': 2, 'coal': 10, 'stone': 5, 'iron-ore': 153, 'iron-plate': 328}`."}
