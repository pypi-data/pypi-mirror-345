{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electric Pole at position (2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position (2.5, 2.5)) is currently not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (6.5, 6.5)) is currently not powered and requires 10 automation science packs to complete research.\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with coal as fuel, but has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (2.0, 0.0)) with coal as fuel, but has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 0.5)) is empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to Electric Poles\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed in a way that they can connect to the electric network. Check the positioning and ensure they are not too far from other powered entities.\n\n### Errors when using building box dimensions\n- Verify the dimensions of the entities you are trying to place. Ensure that the width and height are correctly defined and that you are not attempting to place an entity in an invalid position.\n\n### Errors related to Lab power supply\n- Make sure to connect the lab to a powered electric pole to ensure it receives power. Check the connections and ensure that the electric network is functioning properly.\n\n### Errors related to furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inventory and supply lines to ensure they are being fed with the required materials."}
