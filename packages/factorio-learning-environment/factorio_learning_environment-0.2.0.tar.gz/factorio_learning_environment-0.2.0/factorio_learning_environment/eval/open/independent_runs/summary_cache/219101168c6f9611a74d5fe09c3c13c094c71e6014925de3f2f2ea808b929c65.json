{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5), currently not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n- Boiler at position (x=5.5, y=27.0), with no input liquid and not connected to any fluid system.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5), working status, connected to a series of pipes.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with various pipe groups at different positions facilitating fluid transport.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0), with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, currently holding iron plates.\n- Inserters at positions (x=17.5, y=0.5) and (x=16.5, y=0.5), both not receiving electricity and waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=18.5, y=0.5), serving as storage units.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups with varying statuses (empty, working, full output) connecting different parts of the fluid system, facilitating water transport from offshore pumps to boilers and steam engines.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to the fluid system. Check that pipes are correctly placed to allow water flow from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Electricity Network Connection Problems\n- Verify that all entities requiring electricity, such as inserters and steam engines, are connected to the power network. Ensure small electric poles are placed correctly to provide power.\n\n### Inserter Power and Item Source Issues\n- Connect inserters to the power network to ensure they receive electricity. Make sure that inserters have access to source items to avoid waiting status.\n\n### Fluid System Connection Errors\n- Check that all fluid connections are complete and that there are no missing pipes between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Ensure fluid boxes are not empty where they should be filled."}
