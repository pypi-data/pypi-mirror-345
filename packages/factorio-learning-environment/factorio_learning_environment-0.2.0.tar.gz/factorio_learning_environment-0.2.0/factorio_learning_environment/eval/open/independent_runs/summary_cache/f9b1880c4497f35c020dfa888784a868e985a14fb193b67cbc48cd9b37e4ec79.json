{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no successfully placed structures on the map. All attempts to place wooden chests have failed due to obstructions or errors, and no other structures have been mentioned in the logs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing wooden chests\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place a wooden chest. Check for nearby obstructions and clear any entities that may be blocking the placement.\n- Verify that the position coordinates are within a valid range and accessible for placement.\n\n### Errors with incorrect function usage\n- When using methods or functions, ensure that they are called correctly. For example, avoid treating non-callable objects like 'Position' as callable functions. Correct usage of syntax and function calls is crucial to avoid runtime errors.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore available to supply to furnaces. Regularly check inventory levels and replenish resources as needed to maintain production flow.\n\n### Errors related to data types\n- When dealing with data types, ensure that the correct types are used. For instance, when defining dimensions or properties, confirm that the values are of the expected type to prevent errors like those related to 'int_type'."}
