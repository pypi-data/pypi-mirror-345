{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) [Status: WORKING]\n- Steam engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) [Status: NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) [Status: NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Pipe-group at positions:\n  - (-4.5, 16.5) [Status: EMPTY]\n  - (-9.5, 23.5) [Status: FULL_OUTPUT]\n  - (-7.5, 24.5) [Status: EMPTY]\n  - (-4.5, 24.5) [Status: EMPTY]\n- Electricity-group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715) [Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK]\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) [Status: NO_INGREDIENTS/WORKING]\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes Overlapping Water\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes or pipe-to-ground does not overlap with water. Try a different location if placement fails due to water obstruction.\n\n### Errors Due to Incorrect Prototype Usage\n- Verify the correct usage of API attributes. For example, ensure that 'PipeToGround' is correctly referenced as 'PipeGroup' if applicable.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available before attempting to craft items. For example, iron plates are required for crafting pipe-to-ground.\n\n### Errors Due to Incorrect Data Types\n- Ensure that the correct data types are used in function arguments. For example, when a function expects a string or number, do not pass an incompatible type like 'ModelPrivateAttr'.\n\n### Errors Due to Not Connected Entities\n- Verify connections between entities, such as steam engines and boilers, to ensure they are properly connected to function as intended.\n\n### Errors Due to Empty Inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are present in the inventory before attempting to place or connect entities."}
