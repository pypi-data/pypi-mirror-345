{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Complex\n1. Mining Operation at (-15, -50)\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Connected to wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) storing 516 iron ore\n\n2. Iron Plate Smelting Array\n- Furnace at (-14, -47) with 4 iron plates and 3 coal\n- Furnace at (0, 0) with 4 iron plates and 2 coal\n- Furnace at (2, 0) with 3 iron plates and 3 coal\n- Furnace at (4, 4) with 3 iron plates and 6 coal\n- Furnace at (6, 4) with 53 iron plates and 3 coal\n\n### Automation Science Pack Factory at (24.5, 4.5)\n- Assembling machine-1 for crafting automation science packs\n- Input chest at (21.5, 4.5) containing 765 iron plates\n- Output chest at (27.5, 4.5) containing 2 copper plates and 20 automation science packs\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - Input inserter at (22.5, 4.5) with 3 coal\n  - Output inserter at (26.5, 4.5) with 4 coal\n\n### Power Generation System\n1. Water Supply\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipe network (system 24807) carrying water\n\n2. Steam Generation\n- Boiler at (-2, 23.5) containing 200 water at 15\u00b0C\n- Steam engine at (2.5, 19.5)\n\n3. Power Distribution\n- Electricity network (id 136274) with multiple electric poles\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing pipes at target locations\n- When placing electric poles, ensure proper spacing and check for existing poles in the target area\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Ensure steam engine is properly connected to power network\n- Connect steam engine to proper fluid inputs\n- Maintain fuel supply in boilers\n\n### Assembly Machine Operation\n- Ensure consistent supply of all required ingredients (copper plates and iron gear wheels)\n- Maintain power supply to assembly machines\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in burner devices\n- Ensure sufficient fuel is available before attempting to insert into machines\n- Keep track of inventory levels to prevent failed insertion attempts\n\n### Entity Access Errors\n- Verify entity existence at specified positions before attempting to access them\n- Use correct entity prototypes when trying to get or manipulate entities"}
