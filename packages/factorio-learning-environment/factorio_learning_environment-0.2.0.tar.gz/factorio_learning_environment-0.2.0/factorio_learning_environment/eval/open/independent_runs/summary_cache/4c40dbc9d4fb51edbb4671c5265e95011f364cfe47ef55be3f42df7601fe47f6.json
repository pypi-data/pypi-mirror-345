{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units remaining)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units available)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (671 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units remaining)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients to Smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source entity (e.g., chest) and the drop position is aligned with the destination entity (e.g., furnace). Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel. Consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal to maintain operations.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid errors related to missing resources.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Verify that the inserter setup is correctly configured to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Misconfigurations can result in the furnace not receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting."}
