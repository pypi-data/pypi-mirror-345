{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring items to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items to the furnace.\n\n### Additional Iron Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) for additional iron ore smelting.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0) for additional iron ore smelting.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and prevent interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n### Warnings about furnaces with no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to avoid idle time and maximize production efficiency."}
