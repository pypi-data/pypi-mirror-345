{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Connected Pipes forming a network from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with fuel and iron ore input\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) with a recipe for copper cable\n- Inserters and small electric poles facilitating input and output\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=0.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for storage\n\n### Copper Ore Mining at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for storage\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions for material transport\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to access non-existent entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. For example, check for the presence of a wooden chest before trying to get or place it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without inventory\n- Verify that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, ensure you have a wooden chest in your inventory before trying to place it at a specific position.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Ensure there is a valid destination for inserter outputs to prevent blockage. Check that the destination entity can accept the items being transferred.\n\n### Assembling Machine Resource Shortage\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available for the assembling machine to function. For example, ensure copper plates are available for copper cable production.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check that the input resources are available and correctly configured."}
