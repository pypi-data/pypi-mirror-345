{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=1.0, y=1.0) and (x=3.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=1.0, y=1.0) and (x=3.0, y=1.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=-0.5), (x=3.5, y=-0.5), (x=-0.5, y=1.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), and (x=3.5, y=2.5) for inserting fuel and iron ore into the furnaces.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs at various positions, facilitating the transport of materials across the map. Specific belt positions include:\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n  - Belt from (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure that the required items (e.g., iron ore, coal) are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces or inserters. This can prevent errors related to missing items during insertion operations.\n\n### Errors with Refueling and Inserter Operations\n- Verify that inserters and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and refuel these entities to avoid interruptions in production.\n- Be cautious of inserters waiting for source items; ensure that the necessary materials are available and properly routed to the inserters.\n\n### Assertion Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Confirm that furnaces are functioning correctly by ensuring they have both fuel and input materials. If a furnace is not working, check for issues such as lack of fuel or a full input inventory.\n\nBy addressing these common errors, you can improve the efficiency and reliability of your production processes in the game."}
