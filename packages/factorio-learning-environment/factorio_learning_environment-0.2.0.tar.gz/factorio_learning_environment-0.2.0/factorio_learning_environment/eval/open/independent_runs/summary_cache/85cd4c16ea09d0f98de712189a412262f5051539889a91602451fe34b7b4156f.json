{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage.\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0).\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0).\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0).\n- **Iron Chests** for storing iron plates:\n  - Chest at position (-6.5, -50.5).\n  - Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel in Furnaces\n- Ensure that all furnaces have a sufficient supply of coal to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check fuel levels and refuel as necessary.\n\n### Full Chests Preventing Mining Operations\n- The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing the burner mining drill from continuing operations. Regularly empty chests to ensure continuous mining.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) have warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that iron ore is continuously supplied to these furnaces to maintain production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron ore extracted and inserted into furnaces.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron plates extracted from furnaces.\n- `furnace_fuel_level: dict` - A dictionary tracking the fuel levels of each furnace by position.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the current structures, error tips, and namespace details based on the latest execution logs."}
