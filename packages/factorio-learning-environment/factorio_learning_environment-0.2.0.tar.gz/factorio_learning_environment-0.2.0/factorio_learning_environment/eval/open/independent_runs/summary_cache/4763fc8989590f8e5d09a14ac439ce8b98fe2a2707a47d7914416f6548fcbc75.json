{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, facilitating steam and water flow.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (19.5, 18.5) for copper ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) for producing copper cables, currently facing a shortage of copper plates.\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) and a Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 2.5) for handling materials.\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5).\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- BeltGroup at Position (10.5, 5.5) facilitating movement of items, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the required source items to function properly. Check the supply chain and ensure that all necessary materials are being fed into the system.\n\n### Errors with Assembling Machine Ingredient Shortage\n- Verify that all required ingredients for the assembling machine's recipe are available. In this case, ensure a steady supply of copper plates to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors with Empty Transport Belts\n- Regularly check upstream sources to ensure that transport belts are supplied with items. Address any blockages or supply issues to maintain a continuous flow of materials."}
