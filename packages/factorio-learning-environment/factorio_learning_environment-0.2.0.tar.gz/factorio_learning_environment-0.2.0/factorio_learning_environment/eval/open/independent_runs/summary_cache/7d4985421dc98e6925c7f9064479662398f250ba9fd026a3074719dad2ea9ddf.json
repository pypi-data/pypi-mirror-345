{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Out of fuel, no ingredients to smelt\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-10.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items, out of fuel\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Pickup position: (x=-11.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop position: (x=-9.5, y=-48.5)\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- **Belt Group 1**\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5), direction: RIGHT\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5), direction: RIGHT\n  - Status: Empty, 4 belts\n- **Belt Group 2**\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5), direction: RIGHT\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5), direction: UP\n  - Status: Empty, 13 belts\n- **Belt Group 3**\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5), direction: LEFT\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5), direction: RIGHT\n  - Status: Empty, 10 belts\n- **Belt Group 4**\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-52.5), direction: UP\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5), direction: UP\n  - Status: Empty, 4 belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Path Creation\n- Ensure that the path for the transport belts is valid and can be normalized. Check for obstacles or incorrect connections that might prevent the belt from connecting between the specified positions (x=-19.5, y=-51.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Low Iron Plate Production\n- Investigate the iron plate production line to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Ensure that the furnaces have a consistent supply of fuel and raw materials to maintain production levels."}
