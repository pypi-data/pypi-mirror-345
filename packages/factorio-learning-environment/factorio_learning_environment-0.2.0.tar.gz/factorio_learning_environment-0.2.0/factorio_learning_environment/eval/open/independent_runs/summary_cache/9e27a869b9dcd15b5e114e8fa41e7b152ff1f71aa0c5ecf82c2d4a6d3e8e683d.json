{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 2.5)\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 18) and status: no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Furnace at position(2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 7) and status: no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### Lab at position(0, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 0, 1) with lab input (automation-science-pack: 200) and status: no power.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity group (id: 933) with poles at positions:\n  - (5.5, 4.5)\n  - (2.5, 2.5)\n  - (0.5, 1.5)\n  - (1.5, 1.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric poles\n- Ensure that electric poles are properly connected to the electric network to avoid the status of NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventories\n- Ensure that the entity being inspected is valid and exists in the game world. Avoid using prototypes directly when an entity or position is expected.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a lab\n- Check the lab's inventory capacity before attempting to insert items. Ensure that the lab is not full to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available and that the necessary crafting machines or furnaces are in place to produce the items needed for crafting.\n\n### Errors when accessing entities\n- Verify the position of entities before attempting to access them. Ensure that the entity type exists at the specified position to avoid errors related to entity retrieval."}
