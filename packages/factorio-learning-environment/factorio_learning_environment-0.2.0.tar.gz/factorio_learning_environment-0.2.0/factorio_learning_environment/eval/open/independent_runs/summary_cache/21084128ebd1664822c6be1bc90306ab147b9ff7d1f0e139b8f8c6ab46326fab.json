{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (1 unit)\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid positions\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing entities or items on the ground that might block placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- Verify the presence of the required entity at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. This includes ensuring the entity type matches the expected prototype.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. This includes checking for sufficient quantities of fuel or resources needed for operations.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Regularly clear the output area of drills and furnaces to ensure continuous operation and prevent blockages. Consider placing a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to automatically collect outputs.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. This involves checking the inventory of the furnace and supplying the required raw materials."}
