{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Mining Drills, and Stone Furnaces have failed, resulting in no updated entities on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, and Stone Furnace**: Ensure that the position where you are trying to place these entities is not occupied or invalid. Check for sufficient space and correct positioning before attempting to place entities.\n\n### Errors in API usage\n- **Error in GetEntities function**: The second argument must be a Position object. Ensure that you are passing the correct type of arguments to the functions you are using.\n\n### General placement issues\n- **Repeated failure to update entities on the map**: Double-check the conditions and environment before placing structures. Consider verifying the terrain and ensuring that there are no obstructions or invalid conditions preventing placement."}
