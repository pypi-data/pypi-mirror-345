{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal fuel, connected to a stone furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with coal fuel, processing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal fuel, connected to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined resources.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0), currently out of fuel and lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or mining drills. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors When Furnaces Run Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of your furnaces to ensure they do not run out of fuel. This will prevent the furnace from stopping production and showing warnings such as \"out of fuel\" and \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities such as furnaces and mining drills. Ensure the inventory has the required items before calling this function to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity, used in insert operations.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity, used in insert operations."}
