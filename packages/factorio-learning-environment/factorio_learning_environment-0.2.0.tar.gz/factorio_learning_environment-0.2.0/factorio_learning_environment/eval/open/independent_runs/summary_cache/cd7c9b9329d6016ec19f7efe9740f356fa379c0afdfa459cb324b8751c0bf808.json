{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Produces: Iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is free before attempting to place entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the destination tile is valid and unoccupied before moving entities like Stone Furnaces to avoid movement errors.\n\n### Errors when extracting or interacting with entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to interact with exists at the specified position. For example, trying to get a Stone Furnace at a position where it does not exist will result in an error. Always confirm the presence of the entity before interaction."}
