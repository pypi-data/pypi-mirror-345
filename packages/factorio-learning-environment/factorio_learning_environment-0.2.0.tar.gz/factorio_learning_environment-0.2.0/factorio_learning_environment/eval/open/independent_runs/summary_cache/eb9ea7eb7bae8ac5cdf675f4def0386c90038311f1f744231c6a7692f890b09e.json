{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41-45, y=-83 to -79)\nComplex structure for mining and transporting coal consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Storage chain:\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) for primary coal storage (1600 coal)\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for intermediate storage (723 coal)\n- Transport system:\n  - Burner inserter at (42.5, -79.5) facing DOWN\n  - Transport belt at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Burner inserter at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT for furnace feeding\n\n### Furnace System (around x=45-49, y=-81)\nSmelting setup consisting of:\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Storage chest (wooden) at (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Belt Network\n- Belt group running from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5)\n- Additional belt at (42.5, -80.5) oriented RIGHT\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Always check if target location is clear before placing entities\n   - Remove existing entities if they occupy needed space\n   - Common error when trying to place burner-inserter or transport-belt where another entity exists\n\n2. Inserter Orientation Issues\n   - Ensure proper orientation of inserters relative to their pickup and drop locations\n   - Multiple attempts were made to fix chest inserter orientation, suggesting need for better initial placement planning\n\n3. Transport System Configuration\n   - Verify complete path connectivity before placing transport elements\n   - Ensure inserters can reach their intended pickup and drop locations\n   - Consider removing and replacing elements when reconfiguring transport chains\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `belt_down`: TransportBelt\n- `belt_right`: TransportBelt\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill\n\nFunctions:\n- `place_entity()`: Places entities on the map\n  - Success: Returns placed entity\n  - Failure: Throws exception when placement location is occupied\n\nSystem States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: For active entities\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: For inserters waiting for items\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: For furnaces without materials\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: For basic entities like chests\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: For empty belt systems"}
