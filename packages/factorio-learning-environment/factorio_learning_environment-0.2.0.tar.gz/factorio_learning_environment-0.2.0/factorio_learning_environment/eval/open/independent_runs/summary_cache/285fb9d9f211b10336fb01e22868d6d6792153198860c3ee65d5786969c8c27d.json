{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Storage and Distribution System at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) for storage.\n- Wooden chest (position 43.5, -80.5) containing coal.\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Facility at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 52.0, -79.0) for smelting iron.\n- Burner inserter (position 53.5, -79.5) transferring items to the furnace.\n- Wooden chest (position 54.5, -79.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner inserter (position 55.5, -78.5) transferring items to another chest.\n- Wooden chest (position 56.5, -78.5) for storage.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Operation at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) for mining iron ore.\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) for storage.\n- Burner inserter (position -13.5, -48.5) transferring items from the drill to the chest.\n- Burner inserter (position -12.5, -48.5) assisting in item transfer.\n\n#### Central Storage Hub at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple wooden chests (positions 0.5, 0.5 to 5.5, 0.5) storing various items including coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure all burner entities (e.g., burner mining drills, burner inserters) have sufficient coal to operate. Regularly check and refill fuel inventories.\n\n#### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills and inserters from halting operations. For example, the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full and needs to be emptied.\n\n#### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces and other production entities have the necessary ingredients to function. For example, the stone furnace at (52.0, -79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n#### Errors due to waiting for source items\n- Ensure inserters have access to the items they need to transfer. For example, the burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) is waiting for source items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- None assigned yet."}
