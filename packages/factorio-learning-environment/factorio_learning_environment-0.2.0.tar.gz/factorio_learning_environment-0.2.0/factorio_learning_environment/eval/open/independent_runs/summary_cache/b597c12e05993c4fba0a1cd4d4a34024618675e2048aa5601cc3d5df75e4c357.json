{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Chest at position(5.5, 5.5)\nConsists of a wooden-chest at position(5.5, 5.5)\n\n###Chest at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of a wooden-chest at position(15.5, 70.5)\n\n###Electric mining drill at position(18.5, 72.5)\nConsists of an electric mining drill at position(18.5, 72.5)\n\n###Power generation at position(25.5, 73.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position(25.5, 73.0) and a steam engine at position(29.5, 73.5)\n\n###Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n\n###New Power generation at position(-3.5, 1.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position(-3.5, 1.0) and a steam engine at position(0.5, 1.5), connected to offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5) with pipes\n\n###Iron ore smelting at position(22.0, 71.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position(22.0, 71.0), an electric mining drill at position(18.5, 72.5) and an inserter at position(20.5, 71.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when placing electric mining drill:\n  - Ensure the target location is not occupied by another entity or water before attempting to place an electric mining drill.\n- Errors when placing boiler or steam engine:\n  - Verify that the target location is not occupied by another entity or resource before attempting to place a boiler or steam engine.\n  - Ensure that the boiler or steam engine is being placed at a valid position.\n- Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler:\n  - Ensure that there is a valid connection between the offshore pump and the boiler. Make sure none of the source or target connections points are blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n- Errors when placing pumpjack near crude oil patch:\n  - Ensure the target location is not occupied by another entity or water before attempting to place a pumpjack.\n  - Verify that the crude oil patch is large enough and the center is correctly identified before attempting to place a pumpjack.\n  - Check if the pumpjack is being placed at a valid position relative to the crude oil patch.\n- Errors when using incorrect argument types in API calls:\n  - Ensure that the correct data type is used for API arguments. For example, the `get_entities` function requires a `Position` object as its second argument, not a string.\n  - Be aware that 'Direction' object does not have a 'to_position' attribute; instead, use the correct method to convert direction to a position.\n  - The `Nearest` function does not accept keyword arguments like 'position'. Use the correct syntax for the `Nearest` function.\n- Errors when placing chest at crude oil position or other locations:\n  - Verify that the target location is not occupied by another entity or resource before attempting to place a chest.\n  - Ensure that the chest is being placed at a valid position.\n- Errors when placing entities near the current position:\n  - Make sure to check the entities within a close proximity to the current position before attempting to place new entities.\n- Errors when crafting items with insufficient resources:\n  - Ensure that the required resources are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting iron-gear-wheel requires iron-plate, which must be smelted in a furnace first.\n  - Ensure that the required crafting machines or furnaces are available for crafting or smelting items.\n- Errors due to undefined variables:\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before they are used in the code.\n- Errors when getting resource patches:\n  - Ensure that the specified resource exists at the given location before attempting to retrieve it.\n- Errors when connecting transport belts:\n  - Ensure that transport belts are connected to valid entities, such as inserters, before attempting to connect them to other entities like furnaces.\n- Errors when attempting to connect entities with occupied positions:\n  - Ensure that the target position for an entity connection is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo functions have been defined by the agent."}
