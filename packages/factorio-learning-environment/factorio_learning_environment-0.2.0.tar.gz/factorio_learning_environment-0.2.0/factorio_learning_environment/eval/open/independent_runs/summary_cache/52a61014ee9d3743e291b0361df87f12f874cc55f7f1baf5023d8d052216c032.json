{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with a full inventory of coal (50/50 items) and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) with an inventory containing 613 iron ore.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) with 1 coal as fuel and currently operational, but with a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Copper Plate Factory (not explicitly mentioned but inferred)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) and a Wooden Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 661 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Error when inserting into a full furnace**\n  - Ensure the furnace has available inventory space before attempting to insert items. In this case, the Stone Furnace at position (0, 0) was full, preventing coal insertion.\n\n- **Repeated extraction errors**\n  - The Stone Furnace reported \"No iron plates available to extract.\" Ensure that there are items available in the furnace before attempting to extract.\n\n- **Warnings from Burner Mining Drill**\n  - Address the warning from the Burner Mining Drill regarding the chest being full. Clear the Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to allow continued mining operations.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Failure occurred due to the furnace being full.\n  \n- **Important Variables Assigned**\n  - `furnace`: type `Furnace`, represents the Stone Furnace at position (0, 0).\n  - `wooden_chest`: type `Chest`, represents the Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: type `BurnerMiningDrill`, represents the Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0).\n  - `current_inventory`: type `Inventory`, represents the agent's current inventory containing wood, coal, iron ore, and iron plates."}
