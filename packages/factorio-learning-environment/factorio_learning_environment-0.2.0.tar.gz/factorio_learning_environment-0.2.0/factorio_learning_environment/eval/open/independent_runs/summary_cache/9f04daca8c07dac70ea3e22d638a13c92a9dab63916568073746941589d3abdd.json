{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items, intended to move items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (53.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (52.5, -79.5) moving coal from the chest to another chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items, intended to move items from the chest at position (52.5, -77.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have the required items to be moved. Check for blockages or missing items in the source entities.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly empty chests that are used as drop positions for mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
