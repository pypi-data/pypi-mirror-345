{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-18.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-13.5, -49.5), and (-14.5, -47.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-12.5, -49.5) and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) for mining coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) for processing.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and processed materials.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) for transferring materials between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional coal storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity before attempting to extract items to avoid extraction failures.\n\n### Errors when clearing outputs from furnaces\n- Ensure that the output slots of furnaces are not full before attempting to clear them.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract from storage\n- Verify that the storage is not empty before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors when clearing drop chests for mining drills\n- Ensure that drop chests are not full to allow continuous operation of mining drills. Regularly clear or transfer items from these chests to prevent mining interruptions."}
