{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5). The drill is currently working but has a warning that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, indicating there is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) fueled with coal. The furnace has a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt' and is currently not producing due to the lack of input materials. It is capable of producing iron plates from iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, and Burner Inserters is not already occupied by another entity or obstructed by items on the ground. Verify the placement area before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Confirm that the destination for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is valid and unoccupied. Check the target position for any existing entities that might block the movement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- When using functions like `get_entity`, ensure that the specified position contains the expected entity type. Double-check the coordinates and the presence of the entity at the desired location before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Address warnings from entities like the Burner Mining Drill about output blockage by ensuring there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output from the drill. This will prevent the drill from becoming blocked and halting production.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt Warnings\n- For furnaces with warnings about no ingredients to smelt, ensure that the necessary input materials, such as iron ore for iron plate production, are supplied to the furnace to maintain continuous operation."}
