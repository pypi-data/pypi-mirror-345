{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) which is currently working and fueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) which is full and contains iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup at Position (60.5, -52.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (60.5, -52.5) which is fueled with coal but is waiting for source items.\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0) which is fueled with coal but has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Not Working Properly\n- Ensure that the inserter has both power and the necessary items to move. Check the source and destination inventories to ensure they are not empty or full, respectively.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid such errors.\n\n### Extraction Errors Due to Empty Source\n- Ensure that the source entity, such as a chest, contains the items you wish to extract. Regularly check and refill the source entities as needed.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full inventory.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of fuel (coal) in your inventory to keep all fuel-dependent entities operational. Regularly harvest coal and distribute it to entities that require it."}
