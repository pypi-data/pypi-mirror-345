{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5), boiler (position -24.5, -50.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (unknown) and inserter at position (unknown) that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position unknown) that connects the furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) to the assembling machine at position (unknown).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect entities, such as electric poles to boilers or steam engines. Inspect the area for any obstructions before making the connection.\n\n### Errors when trying to access non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting to access them. In this case, ensure that a lab is present at the specified position before calling it.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
