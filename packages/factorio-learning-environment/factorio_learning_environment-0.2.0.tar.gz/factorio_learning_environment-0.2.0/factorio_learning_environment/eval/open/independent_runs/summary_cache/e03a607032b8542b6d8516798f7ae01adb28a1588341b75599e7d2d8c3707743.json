Raw resources must be gathered, not crafted.\n-  The agent attempted to craft `iron-plate` and `burner-mining-drill` directly. `iron-plate` must be smelted in a furnace, and `burner-mining-drill` requires `iron-gear-wheel` which also requires smelting. Ensure intermediate steps are done first.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- The agent attempted to insert items into a furnace when it didn't have enough of those items in its inventory. Ensure sufficient items are in the inventory before attempting to insert.\n\n### Errors when using inserting but being too far\n -  Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to insert items into before inserting items\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place a entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to each other\n- Ensure that there is enough space to place an entity next to another entity. Consider the size of the entities and the direction of placement.\n- Check for collisions with existing entities or unplaceable areas like water.\n- Increase the spacing between entities or change the direction of placement.\n\n### Errors when crafting items that require raw resources\n-  The agent attempted to craft `wooden-chest` and `stone-furnace` directly. Raw resources like `wood` and `stone` must be gathered, not crafted.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions:\n\n### Variables:\n```python\nPrototype.Coal : Type[Item]\nPrototype.IronOre : Type[Item]\n```\n```"}
