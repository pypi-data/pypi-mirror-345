{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) with drop position (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5) containing 11 iron ore\n- Drill contains 11 coal\n- System status: drill working\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-20.5, -71.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest at (-20.5, -71.5) containing 2 copper ore\n- Original drill has been removed and needs replacement\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 15.5) facing UP\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) (currently out of fuel)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting components:\n  - Empty pipe group at (-14.5, 12.5)\n  - Water-filled pipe group at (-16.5, 19.5)\n  - Empty pipe group at (-9.5, 20.5)\n  - Empty pipe group at (5.5, 25.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting broader system\nSystem status:\n- Steam engine not receiving electricity\n- Boiler out of fuel but contains water (200 units at 15\u00b0)\n- Offshore pump working\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab at (10.5, 0.5) containing 15 automation science packs\n- Currently researching logistics technology\n- No power due to steam engine issues\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Issues\n- Recipes need to be enabled before crafting even if technology is researched\n- Common failing recipes: burner mining drill, iron gear wheel, stone furnace\n- Verify required ingredients are available before crafting\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Cannot place burner mining drills without having them in inventory\n- Verify inventory has required entity before attempting placement\n- Check position is clear before placing new entities\n\n### Resource Extraction Issues\n- Cannot extract from drill's burner inventory directly\n- Moving or replacing drills to access their fuel is not working\n- Ensure proper positioning when attempting to extract resources\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in all fuel-consuming entities\n- Current critical issue: Boiler has no fuel\n- Keep track of drill fuel levels (copper drill: 12 coal, iron drill: 11 coal)\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Steam engine not receiving electricity due to no fuel in boiler\n- Monitor fluid connections between power system components\n- Address \"no input liquid\" warnings in steam engine\n\n### API Usage Issues\n- PipeGroup class reference errors in code\n- Handle nil values appropriately in recipe and crafting operations\n- Verify entity existence before attempting operations\n\n### Research Issues\n- Cannot start already researched technologies (e.g., automation)\n- Monitor research progress for currently researching technology"}
