{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently working and extracting resources.\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that serves as the drop-off point for extracted iron ore. The chest is currently full and needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently working but has a full output inventory of iron plates. It requires input of iron ore to continue operation.\n\n### Additional Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) which currently contains iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**\n  - Ensure to regularly empty the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to allow the burner mining drill to continue extracting iron ore.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace result is full**\n  - Regularly check the output of the stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and empty its inventory to allow for continuous processing of iron ore.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `inventory`: dict"}
