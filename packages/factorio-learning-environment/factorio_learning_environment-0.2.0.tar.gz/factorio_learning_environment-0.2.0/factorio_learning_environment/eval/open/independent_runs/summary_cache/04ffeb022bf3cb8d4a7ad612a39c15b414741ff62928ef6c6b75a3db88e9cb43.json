{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-19, -50) and (-15, -50)\nTwo identical mining setups consisting of:\n- Burner mining drills at (-19, -50) and (-15, -50) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chests at (-18.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) collecting the mined ore\nBoth drills are operational with coal fuel and mining iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Setup at (-28, -61)\nMining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5) collecting the mined ore\nDrill is operational with coal fuel and mining copper ore\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at (0,0) and (2,0)\nComplex smelting setup with:\n- Two stone furnaces at (0,0) and (2,0)\n- Input inserter system:\n  - Wooden chest at (-2.5, 0.5) with burner inserter at (-1.5, 0.5) feeding first furnace\n  - Wooden chest at (4.5, 0.5) with burner inserter at (3.5, 0.5) feeding second furnace\n- Output inserter system:\n  - Burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) extracting from first furnace to chest at (0.5, 2.5)\n  - Burner inserter at (2.5, 1.5) extracting from second furnace to chest at (2.5, 2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Smelting Setup at (-6, 0)\nSimple smelting setup with:\n- Stone furnace at (-6, 0) smelting copper ore into plates\n\n### Research Setup at (10.5, 0.5)\n- Lab at (10.5, 0.5) for conducting research (currently unpowered)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Technology and Recipe Availability Errors\n- Research automation technology before attempting to craft assembling machines\n- Ensure all required recipes are unlocked before attempting to craft items\n- Complex items like labs require multiple sub-components - plan the manufacturing chain\n\n### Resource/Item Availability Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before placing entities\n- Gather raw resources like wood that cannot be crafted\n- Make sure to have fuel (coal) available before attempting to insert it into burner entities\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Stay within maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from player position\n- Check for conflicting entities or terrain before placing new entities\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and valid positions\n- Verify resource patches exist when placing mining drills\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- When placing inserters next to buildings, use appropriate spacing to avoid conflicts\n- Ensure both pickup and drop positions have valid container entities\n- Add fuel to burner inserters before expecting them to operate\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Ensure power generation is set up before placing power-dependent entities like labs\n- Build complete power infrastructure (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) before connecting electrical devices"}
