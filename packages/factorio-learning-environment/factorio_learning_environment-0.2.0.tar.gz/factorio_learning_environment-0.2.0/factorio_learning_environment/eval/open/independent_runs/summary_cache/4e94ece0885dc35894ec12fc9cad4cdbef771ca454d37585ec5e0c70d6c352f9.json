{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59) smelting copper ore\n- Input inserter at (-28.5, -58.5) moving ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates to storage\n- Storage chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing copper plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in sequence:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10, -59) with chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8, -59) with chest at (-7.5, -57.5)  \n- Burner mining drill at (-6, -59) with chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are operational and mining iron ore into their respective chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- 4 stone furnaces at (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0)\n- Input inserters at (0.5,-1.5), (2.5,-1.5), (4.5,-1.5), and (6.5,-1.5)\n- Output inserters at (0.5,1.5), (2.5,1.5), (4.5,1.5), and (6.5,1.5)\n- Input storage chests at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), and (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output storage chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), and (6.5,2.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Drill Output Blocking\n- Ensure there is a proper output entity (chest, inserter, or belt) placed at the drill's output position before starting operation\n- Current example: Copper ore drill has warning about blocked output\n\n### Entity Placement\n- Check that target placement location is clear of other entities\n- Verify entity orientations match intended input/output flows\n- Ensure connected entities (like inserters) have proper pickup and drop positions relative to source/destination entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep fuel (coal) levels maintained in burner entities to prevent work stoppage\n- Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow or backup of materials"}
