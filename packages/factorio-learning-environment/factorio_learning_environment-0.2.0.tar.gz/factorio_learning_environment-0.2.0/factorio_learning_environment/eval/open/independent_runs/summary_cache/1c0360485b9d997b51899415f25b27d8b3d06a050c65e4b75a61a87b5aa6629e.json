{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as all attempts to place entities have failed. The map remains empty of any constructed entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and inserters have failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors in automation setup\n- Define all variables and objects before using them in automation scripts. The error \"name 'new_chest' is not defined\" indicates an attempt to use an undefined variable.\n\n### Errors in moving to positions\n- When using the `move_to` function, ensure that the position is correctly specified as integers. Errors like \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" suggest incorrect data types being used for positions.\n- Avoid treating objects like 'Position' as callable functions. Errors such as \"'Position' object is not callable\" indicate misuse of object types.\n\n### Errors in defining building areas\n- When defining building areas, ensure that there is a viable space for placement. The error \"No viable place to put Prototype.WoodenChest\" suggests that the specified area is either too large or incorrectly defined. Consider using smaller or multiple building boxes.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in constructing and automating processes in the game."}
