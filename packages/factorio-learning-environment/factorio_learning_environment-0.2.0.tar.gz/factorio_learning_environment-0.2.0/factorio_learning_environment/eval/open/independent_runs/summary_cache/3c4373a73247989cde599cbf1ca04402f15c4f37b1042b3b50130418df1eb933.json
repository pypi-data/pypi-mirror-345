{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully constructed during these steps. Multiple recovery attempts were made to deploy a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5); however, no Lab was ever placed because none was available in the inventory. Although pre\u2010existing furnaces were referenced for smelting (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron plate smelting and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production), these have not been created by the agent during the current execution.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Misuse\n  - When invoking get_entities, avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) and passing parameters positionally if the API accepts none. Always confirm the function signature before making the call.\n  \n\u2022 Inventory Verification Failure\n  - Before attempting to place a structure (such as a Lab), verify that the required item is present in the inventory to avoid placement errors.\n  \n\u2022 Unsafe Data Handling\n  - When iterating over results from API calls (for example, filtering lab entities), ensure the returned value is not None. Use a fallback (such as an empty list) to prevent TypeErrors.\n  \n\u2022 Insufficient Resource Errors in Crafting\n  - Lab crafting consistently failed due to missing sub-ingredients (including iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables). Prior to initiating complex craft actions, confirm that all intermediate resources have been sufficiently produced or are available."}
