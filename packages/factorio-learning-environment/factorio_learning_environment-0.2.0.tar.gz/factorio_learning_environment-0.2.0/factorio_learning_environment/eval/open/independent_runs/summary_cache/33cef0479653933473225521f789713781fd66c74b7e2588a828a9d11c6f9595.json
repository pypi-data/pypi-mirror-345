The burner inserter transfers the extracted iron ore. The mining drill is currently waiting for space in destination, and the inserter is also waiting for space in destination.\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nThe furnace is currently working, processing iron ore.\n\n### Chest storage area near (-14.5, -49.5)\nConsists of multiple chests at the following locations:\n- Chest at (-14.5, -66.5)\n- Chest at (-14.5, -57.5)\n- Chest at (-26.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-25.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-24.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-23.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-22.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-21.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-20.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-19.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-18.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-12.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-11.5, -49.5)\n- Chest at (-14.5, -47.5)\n- Chest at (-14.5, -46.5)\n- Chest at (-14.5, -45.5)\n- Chest at (-14.5, -42.5)\n- Chest at (-14.5, -43.5)\n- Chest at (-14.5, -38.5)\n- Chest at (-13.5, -39.5)\n- Chest at (-14.5, -34.5)\n- Chest at (1.5, 0.5)\nThe chests are used for storing various items. The steel chest at (-12.5, -49.5) contains iron ore.\n\n### Belt network\nConsists of multiple belt groups:\n- BeltGroup near (37.5, -83.5)\n- BeltGroup near (45.5, -83.5)\n- BeltGroup near (4.5, -73.5)\n- BeltGroup near (-15.5, -55.5)\n- BeltGroup near (-17.5, -51.5)\n- BeltGroup near (-7.5, -48.5)\nThe belt network is used for transporting items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Burner mining drill and inserter output blocked\n- The burner mining drill and inserter are waiting for space in the destination. Ensure that the destination chest has enough space to receive the iron ore. If the chest is full, the mining drill and inserter will stop working. Place more chests or expand the storage area.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n -  Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place a entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables:\n- None\n### Functions:\n- None\n```"}
