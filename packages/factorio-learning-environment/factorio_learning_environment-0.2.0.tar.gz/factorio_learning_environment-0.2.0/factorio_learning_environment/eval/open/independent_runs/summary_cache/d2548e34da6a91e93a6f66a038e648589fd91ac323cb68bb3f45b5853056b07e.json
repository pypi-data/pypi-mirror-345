{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and drops it into nearby chests.\n- **Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) which smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), and (-8.5, -49.5) which transfer iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- **Chests** at various positions for storage of iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Coal and Iron Plate Storage at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nThis area is used for storing coal and iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) which extracts coal.\n- **Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) which processes materials.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) which manage the transfer of materials between chests and the furnace.\n- **Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), and (47.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Supplying Iron Ore to Furnaces\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply it to furnaces. Regularly check and replenish your inventory to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors when Harvesting with Full Inventory\n- Before harvesting resources, make sure there is enough space in your inventory to accommodate the harvested items. Consider transferring excess items to storage chests.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Blockages\n- Ensure that the inserter drop positions are clear of blockages to maintain smooth operation. Regularly check and clear any obstructions to prevent operational delays.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Ensure that you have enough fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel machines. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary to avoid machine downtime."}
