{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(4, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 4.0, 0.0) with iron-ore (27) and coal (49) as fuel, currently smelting iron-plate.\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with iron-ore (20) and coal (49) as fuel, currently smelting iron-plate.\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt and coal (8) as fuel.\n- Stone furnace (position 6.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt and coal (3) as fuel.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n-  Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n-  Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace has available inventory space before attempting to insert items. The error occurred due to the furnace being full (50/50 items).\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. \n\n### Errors related to insufficient ingredients\n- Check that the required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to smelt or craft."}
