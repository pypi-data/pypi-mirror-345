{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Ore Storage and Extraction:**\n  - Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Iron Smelting Line:**\n  - Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron plate output.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron plate output.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron plate output.\n- **Iron Plate Storage:**\n  - Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates a lack of coal in the inventory when trying to insert into a mining drill.\n\n### Full Storage Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities such as chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. For instance, the warning \"chest at drop position is full\" suggests that the chest needs to be emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the item is not available in the inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `mining_drill`: Represents the mining drill entity being interacted with.\n  - `coal_to_insert`: Integer representing the quantity of coal intended to be inserted into the mining drill."}
