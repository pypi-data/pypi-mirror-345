{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with coal as fuel. It is actively mining iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores mined iron ore. It is connected to the mining drill and is currently full, requiring periodic emptying to continue mining operations.\n- **Additional Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) to increase storage capacity.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled by coal and currently has an inventory of iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which transfers items between the chests and the furnace. It is fueled by coal and is currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. In the case of the burner-inserter placement, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors related to full storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full inventory. This will ensure continuous mining and processing of resources."}
