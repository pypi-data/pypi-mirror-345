{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(111.5, -30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position 117.5, -30.5), boiler(position 111.5, -32.0) and offshore pump (position 106.5, -32.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) and a furnace at position(41.0, -80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position 39.5, -79.5) and a furnace at position(41.0, -80.0)\n-  Belt group (position 39.5, -83.5) that connects the furnace at position 41.0, -80.0 to burner inserter at position 39.5, -79.5\n\n### Offshore pump group at position(116.5, -54.5)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Offshore pump (position 116.5, -54.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 115.5, -51.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 116.5, -53.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 116.5, -49.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 116.5, -47.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 116.5, -45.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 115.5, -43.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 115.5, -41.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 116.5, -40.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 118.5, -40.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 120.5, -40.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 122.5, -39.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 124.5, -39.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 126.5, -37.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 128.5, -35.5)\n-  Offshore pump (position 130.5, -33.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when accessing entity positions\n-  Ensure that you are accessing the position attribute of an entity correctly. The position attribute is an object with x and y properties, not a nested object with a 'position' attribute.\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n-  Make sure that the positions passed to the connect_entities function are integers, not floats.\n### Errors when working with offshore pumps\n-  Ensure that offshore pumps are connected to a fluid system and have a valid fluid source.\n### Errors when working with burners\n-  Ensure that burners have a valid fuel source.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   connect_entities: function that connects two entities with a pipe. It takes the positions of the two entities and the prototype of the pipe as arguments.\n*   Important variables:\n    *   offshore_pump: an OffshorePump object\n    *   boiler: a Boiler object\n    *   position: a Position object with x and y properties\n    *   Prototype.Pipe: the prototype of the pipe entity"}
