{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace, fueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates, currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters with incorrect alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position and the drop position aligns with the furnace's position to facilitate correct transfer of materials.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with potential collisions\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the intended position is not occupied by another entity and that there is no collision with nearby entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure that there are enough resources, such as coal, in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills or inserters."}
