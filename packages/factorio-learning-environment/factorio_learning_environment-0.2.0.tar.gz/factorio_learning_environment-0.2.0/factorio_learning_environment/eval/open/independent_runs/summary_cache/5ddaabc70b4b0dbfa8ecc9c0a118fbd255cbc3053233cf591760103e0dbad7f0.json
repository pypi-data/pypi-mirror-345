{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure the player is within the maximum allowable distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity before attempting placement. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and fuel\n- Ensure inserters are correctly aligned and fueled to transfer items between entities effectively. Regularly check inserter setup if items are not being transferred as expected.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with furnace operation\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inserter setup and fuel levels to maintain continuous operation."}
