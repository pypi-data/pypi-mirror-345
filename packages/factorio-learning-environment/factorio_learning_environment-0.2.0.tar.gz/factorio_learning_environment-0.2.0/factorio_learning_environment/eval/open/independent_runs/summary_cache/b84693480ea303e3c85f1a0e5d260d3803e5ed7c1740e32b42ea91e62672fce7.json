{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nLocated at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for storing mined coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nLocated at positions around (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for storing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-24.5, y=-69.5) facilitating movement of items.\n- Additional Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nLocated at positions around (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Multiple BeltGroups facilitating transportation of materials between entities.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nLocated at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0).\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure there are no gaps between transport belts when connecting them. Verify the alignment and continuity of belts from position (x=-24.0, y=-69.5) to (x=-25.5, y=-69.5).\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure all Burner Mining Drills and Burner Inserters have adequate fuel to operate. Regularly check and refuel entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to no ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that Stone Furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with the required ores to prevent idle time.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Check that the source entities for inserters have items to be moved. Ensure that the supply chain is not disrupted and that items are being produced and transported efficiently."}
