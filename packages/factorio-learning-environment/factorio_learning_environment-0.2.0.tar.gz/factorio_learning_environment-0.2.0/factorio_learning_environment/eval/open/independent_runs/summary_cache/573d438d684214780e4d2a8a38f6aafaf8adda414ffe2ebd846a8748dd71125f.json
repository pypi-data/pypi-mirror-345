{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore. Currently fueled with coal and operational, but the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Additional storage for iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers items between chests. Fueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates. Fueled with coal and operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure the target container (e.g., wooden chest) contains the items you intend to extract. Verify the entity's contents before attempting extraction to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Before placing an entity, check the target position for existing entities that might block placement. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n- Avoid placing entities directly on top of other entities or items on the ground. Ensure the area is clear of obstructions.\n\n### Errors when processing resources\n- Ensure that the furnace is adequately fueled and that there is a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency. Regularly check and refuel as necessary to avoid production halts."}
