{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (15.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Inserters** at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) with warnings about not being connected to the power network and waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) serving as storage units.\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-7.5, 25.5) connected to a pipe network, supplying water.\n- **Pipe Network** at positions ranging from (-6.5, 24.5) to (-1.5, 24.5), with some sections connected to the offshore pump.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Boiler** at position (-1.5, 27.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal, but currently not connected to any fluid source.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (10.5, 34.5) with warnings about not being connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n- **Pipe Network** connected to the steam engine, but currently not supplying any fluid.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Small Electric Poles** distributed across the map, connecting various structures to the electricity network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of any existing entities before attempting to place a pipe.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes over water\n- Avoid placing pipes on tiles where the entity footprint overlaps with water. Consider repositioning the pipes to a suitable location.\n\n### Errors due to distance limitations\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity, as there is a maximum distance limit for placement.\n\n### Errors due to disconnected power network\n- Ensure all inserters and machines are connected to the power network to avoid operational disruptions.\n\n### Errors due to missing fluid connections\n- Verify that all boilers and steam engines are properly connected to a fluid source to ensure functionality."}
