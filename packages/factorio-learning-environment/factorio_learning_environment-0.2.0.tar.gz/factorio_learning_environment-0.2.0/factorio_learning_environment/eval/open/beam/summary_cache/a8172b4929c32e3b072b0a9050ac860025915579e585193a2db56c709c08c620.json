This may involve venturing into less familiar territory.\n2. **Consider Alternative Resource Gathering**: If iron and copper are not available, I could explore other resources that may be present, such as stone or coal, which could be useful for crafting.\n3. **Crafting and Production Maximization**: Focus on crafting any items that can be made with the current inventory, particularly those that can help in future exploration or resource gathering.\n\nLet\u2019s check the position (200, 200) for any potential resources, as it is significantly distant from previous checks.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to the position (200, 200) to search for iron or copper ore patches.\ndistant_exploration_position = Position(x=200, y=200)\nmove_to(distant_exploration_position)\n\n# Attempt to find both iron and copper resource patches at this distant exploration position.\niron_ore_patch_distant_exploration = get_resource_patch(Resource.IronOre, position=distant_exploration_position)\ncopper_resource_patch_distant_exploration = get_resource_patch(Resource.CopperOre, position=distant_exploration_position)\n\n# Check if a new iron ore patch is successfully located\nif iron_ore_patch_distant_exploration:\n    print(f\"Found an iron ore patch at the distant exploration position: {iron_ore_patch_distant_exploration}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No iron ore patches found at the distant exploration position.\")\n\n# Check if a new copper ore patch is successfully located\nif copper_resource_patch_distant_exploration:\n    print(f\"Found a copper ore patch at the distant exploration position: {copper_resource_patch_distant_exploration}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No copper ore patches found at the distant exploration position.\")\n\n# Check entities on the map again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check if there are any new entities present.", "summary_range": "[1-358]"}
