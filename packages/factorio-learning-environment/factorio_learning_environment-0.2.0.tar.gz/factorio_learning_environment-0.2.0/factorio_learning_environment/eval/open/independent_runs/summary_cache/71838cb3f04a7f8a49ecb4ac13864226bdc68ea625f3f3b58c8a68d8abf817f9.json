The TypeError encountered (e.g., \"'Position' object is not callable\") indicates misusage when searching for water patches and retrieving candidate centers.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that candidate retrieval functions (like nearest_buildable) are invoked correctly with proper position references.\n\n\u2022 Buildable Candidate Validation Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple candidate positions for Offshore Pump and Boiler\u2014whether from water-resource searches, manual selections, offset calculations, or grid searches\u2014have been flagged as not buildable. Verify clearance, adjust search radii, and refine offset criteria to secure valid build areas.\n\u2003\u2013 Revalidate candidate positions immediately after any inventory or relocation actions to avoid obsolete references.\n\n\u2022 Water Resource Detection Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Occurrences such as failing to obtain a water patch (e.g., in region (100,100) with the error \"No water at the specified location\") require verifying water resource availability within the target region before initiating candidate searches.\n\n\u2022 Pipeline Connection Sequencing:\n\u2003\u2013 Repeated skips in pipe connection routines due to missing entity placements highlight the need to complete successful candidate placements for critical entities before connecting pipelines.\n\u2003\u2013 Synchronize candidate placement outcomes with subsequent pipe connection attempts to ensure cohesive structure assembly.\n\n\u2022 Prior Validation and Relocation Protocols:\n\u2003\u2013 Maintain rigorous STEAM ENGINE and general candidate position validation by confirming candidate positions are free of obstructions using can_place_entity checks.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all prerequisite ingredients and production machines are active to prevent inventory and crafting validation errors, as noted in previous cycles.\n\u2003\u2013 For Boiler and Offshore Pump relocation errors, preselect open, unobstructed regions and update entity statuses immediately after pick-up events to avoid using outdated candidate positions."}
