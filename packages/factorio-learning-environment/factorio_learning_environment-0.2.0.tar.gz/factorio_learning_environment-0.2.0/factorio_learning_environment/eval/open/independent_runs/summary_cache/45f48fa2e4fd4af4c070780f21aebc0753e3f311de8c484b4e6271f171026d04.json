The maximum distance for placement is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on unsuitable terrain\n- Verify that the target location is suitable for placement and not obstructed by other objects or unplaceable terrain like water.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from incorrect positions\n- Ensure that the entity type and position are correct when using `get_entity`. Double-check the specified position for the entity type you want to retrieve."}
