The lab requires 10 automation science packs to initiate research.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. \n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Check that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the power network. The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network, which may hinder its operation."}
