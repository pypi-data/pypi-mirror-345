{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for copper plate production\n- Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for additional copper plate production\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for iron plate production\n\n### Inserter Setup at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=-3.5, y=2.5) and (x=-2.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) for fluid transportation\n- PipeGroup at position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) transporting water from offshore pump\n- PipeGroup at position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) transporting water to the boiler\n\n### Electricity Networks\n- ElectricityGroup id=2542 with poles spanning various positions for power distribution\n- ElectricityGroup id=2550 with poles at positions (x=-2.5, y=2.5), (x=2.5, y=3.5), (x=-3.5, y=2.5), (x=-1.5, y=3.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Electric Pole Connections\n- Ensure that the electric poles are within range to connect to the intended entities. If the connection fails, verify the distance and ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when Crafting Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Before crafting, check that you have all required materials in your inventory. Specifically, ensure you have enough copper cables when crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a powered electric network. If an inserter is not powered, check the electric pole connections and ensure they are properly linked to a power source."}
