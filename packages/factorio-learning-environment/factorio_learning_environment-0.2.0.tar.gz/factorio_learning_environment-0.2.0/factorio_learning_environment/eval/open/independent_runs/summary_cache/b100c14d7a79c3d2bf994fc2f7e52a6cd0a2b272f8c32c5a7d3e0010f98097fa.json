{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting various positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connecting the furnace to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5) for storing iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not in progress.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions such as (5.5, -59.5), (7.5, -59.5), (5.5, -60.5), and others, with a voltage of 0 indicating no power.\n- Another Electricity Group with poles at positions such as (0.5, 26.5), (14.5, -50.5), (7.5, -55.5), and others, with a voltage of 66.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. For example, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Make sure that inserters are properly connected to a powered electricity network. Verify that the electricity network is active and providing power to all connected entities.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have necessary resources for operations.\n- Verify connections in your electricity network to prevent power outages in critical components."}
