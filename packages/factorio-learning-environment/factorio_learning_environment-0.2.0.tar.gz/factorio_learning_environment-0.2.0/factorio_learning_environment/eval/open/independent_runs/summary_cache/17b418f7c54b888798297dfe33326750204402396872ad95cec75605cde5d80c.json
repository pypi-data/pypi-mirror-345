monitor and address persistent NO_FUEL issues.  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure key modules (e.g., lab, assembling machine) maintain stable electrical connectivity.\n\n\u2022 STEAM ENGINE PLACEMENT & CONNECTION:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate candidate build positions and verify that connection points for both Steam Engines and Boilers are unobstructed before placement.  \n\u2003\u2013 Repeated failures in connecting generators to boilers indicate that source or target connection points may be blocked; confirm clear access and type compatibility when mixing connection methods.  \n\u2003\u2013 When repositioning a Steam Engine, adjust spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with nearby entities (such as pipes, electric poles, or water).  \n\u2003\u2013 Use corrected API approaches (e.g. accessing a buildable area\u2019s center property directly rather than calling it as a function) to prevent type errors.\n\n\u2022 UNDERGROUND PIPE CRAFTING:\n\u2003\u2013 Before attempting to craft UndergroundPipes, ensure all required sub-ingredients (notably sufficient iron-plates) are available.  \n\u2003\u2013 If standard crafting fails due to missing sub-ingredients, consider employing a custom crafting routine while verifying furnace operations.\n\n\u2022 TYPE HANDLING & API USAGE:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid calling non-callable objects (like a Position instance) as functions; access their attributes directly to prevent TypeErrors.\n\n\u2022 TILE & CONNECTION VALIDATION:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre\u2010validate target tile availability and connection feasibility to avoid occupancy errors and conflicts with existing structures.  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that reference positions used for buildable area searches do not impede critical connection paths.\n\n\u2022 INVENTORY VERIFICATION:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that required entities (e.g., a Steam Engine) are present in the inventory before attempting placement to avoid inventory-related errors.\n\n\u2022 MIXED CONNECTION ERRORS:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that both Steam Engine and Boiler connection points are free from obstructions (such as nearby pipes, electric poles, or water) to enable valid connections; reassess connection strategies if errors persist."}
