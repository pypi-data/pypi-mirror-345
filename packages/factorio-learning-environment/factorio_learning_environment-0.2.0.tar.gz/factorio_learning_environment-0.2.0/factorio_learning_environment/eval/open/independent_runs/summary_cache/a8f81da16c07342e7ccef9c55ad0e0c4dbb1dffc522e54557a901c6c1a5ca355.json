{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units)\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: NORMAL\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (42 units)\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Fuel: None (out of fuel warning)\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. The inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) was frequently repositioned and checked for alignment issues.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to refuel entities such as mining drills and inserters. The inserter and mining drill frequently ran out of fuel, causing interruptions in operations.\n\n### Errors in Resource Crafting\n- Avoid attempting to craft raw resources like coal, as they cannot be crafted and must be gathered directly from the environment. The agent attempted to craft coal, which resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage\n- Regularly empty storage entities, such as chests, to prevent them from becoming full and halting production processes. The chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) was full, preventing further mining operations."}
