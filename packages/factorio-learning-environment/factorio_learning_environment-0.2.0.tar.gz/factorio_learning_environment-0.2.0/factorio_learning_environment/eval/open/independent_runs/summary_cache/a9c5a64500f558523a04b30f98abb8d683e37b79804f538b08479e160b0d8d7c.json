{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nThis structure is responsible for generating electricity and consists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), which is currently working and connected to a pipe-to-ground at position (x=16.5, y=17.5) and a pipe at position (x=17.5, y=17.5).\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), which is fueled with coal and working. It is connected to multiple pipes, including those at positions (x=-0.5, y=21.5), (x=1.5, y=21.5), (x=0.5, y=21.5), (x=2.5, y=21.5), (x=3.5, y=21.5), and (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), which is working and connected to pipes at positions (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=-8.5, y=23.5).\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- **Steam Pipe Group**: This group is part of the fluid system 2939 and transports steam. It includes pipes at positions ranging from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n- **Water Pipe Group**: This group is part of the fluid system 2950 and transports water. It includes pipes at positions ranging from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group**: This group includes poles at various positions, such as (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=10.5, y=13.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), up to (x=27.5, y=26.5), and (x=20.5, y=19.5), with a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that all entities you intend to connect are within a valid range and are compatible for connection. In the case of connecting a boiler to a steam engine using pipes, verify that the positions and types of entities are correctly specified and that there are no obstructions or missing connections.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine, Prototype.Pipe)`: This function is intended to connect a boiler to a steam engine using pipes. It failed due to an inability to establish a connection, possibly due to incorrect positioning or missing entities.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of pipes intended to connect the boiler and steam engine, which encountered a connection failure.\n- `inventory`: Dictionary containing current inventory items such as 'wooden-chest', 'burner-inserter', 'small-electric-pole', 'pipe', and others with their respective quantities."}
