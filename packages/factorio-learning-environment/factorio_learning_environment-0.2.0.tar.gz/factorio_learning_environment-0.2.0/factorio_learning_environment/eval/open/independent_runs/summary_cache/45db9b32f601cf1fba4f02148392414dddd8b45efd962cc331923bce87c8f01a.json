{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Repeated repositioning indicates potential misalignment issues.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to pick up iron ore from the chest and drop it into the furnace. Check the inserter's pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Inserter Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel inserters to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels to prevent operational interruptions.\n\n### Attempting to Insert Items Without Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory. This prevents execution errors related to missing items."}
