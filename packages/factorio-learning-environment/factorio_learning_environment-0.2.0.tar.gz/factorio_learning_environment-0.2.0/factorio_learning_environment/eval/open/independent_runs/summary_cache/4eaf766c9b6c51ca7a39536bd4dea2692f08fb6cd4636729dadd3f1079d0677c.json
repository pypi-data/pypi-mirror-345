{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. Misalignment will prevent the inserter from transferring items correctly.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position to ensure proper item transfer.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Collision\n- Before placing an entity, check for potential collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water). Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position as needed to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Resource Insertion Errors\n- Ensure that the required resources are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. Lack of resources will result in failed insertion attempts.\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure that the furnace receives the necessary ingredients for smelting. Without the correct input, the furnace will not operate as intended."}
