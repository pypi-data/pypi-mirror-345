{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around position 41, -82)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Connected to input wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around position 46, -81)\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input wooden chest at (45.5, -79.5) containing iron ore\n- Output wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n- Output burner inserter at (48.5, -80.5) moving items from rightmost furnace to output chest\n\nAdditional wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5) with unknown purpose\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing inserters\n- Multiple failed attempts to place inserters at occupied positions (45.0, -80.0), (45.0, -79.5), (45.5, -80.5)\n\n### System Configuration Errors\n- Inserter pickup/drop position verification failures\n- Incorrect inserter rotations tried (RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN) before finding correct configuration\n- Ensure inserter positions and rotations are properly calculated before placement\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Coal storage chests are full, causing mining drill to wait\n- Empty chests periodically to maintain continuous operation\n\n### System Design Issues\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning despite having fuel\n- Ensure proper item flow configuration between chests, inserters and furnaces\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails when target location is occupied.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter - Controls input to first furnace\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter - Controls input to second furnace\n\nSuccess/Failure Patterns:\n- Entity placement succeeds when target location is clear\n- Entity placement fails when location is occupied by another entity\n- Inserter configuration requires precise pickup/drop position calculations"}
