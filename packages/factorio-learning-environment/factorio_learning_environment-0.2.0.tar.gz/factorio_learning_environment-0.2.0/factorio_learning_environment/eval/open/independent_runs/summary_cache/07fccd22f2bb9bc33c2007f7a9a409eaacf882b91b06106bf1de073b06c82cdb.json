{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around position 41,-81)\nComplex automated coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Storage system with multiple chests:\n  - Two iron chests (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) both containing 1600 coal each\n  - Wooden chest (41.5, -80.5) serving as buffer with ~450 coal\n- Transport system:\n  - Burner inserter (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from wooden chest to belt\n  - Transport belt (43.5, -80.5) moving coal rightward\n\n### Smelting Setup (around position 45,-81)\nTwo furnace setup:\n- First furnace (45.0, -81.0) with fuel slot filled (50 coal)\n- Second furnace (47.0, -81.0) with fuel slot filled (50 coal)\n- Storage chest (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Main belt group running from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5) with 10 belts\n- Additional belt at (43.5, -80.5) oriented rightward\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Multiple failed attempts to place burner-inserter due to existing objects in the way\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Use position checking functions to validate placement locations\n\n### Transport Belt Blocking Issues\n- Warning about transport belt being blocked at (43.5, -80.5)\n- Implement logic to manage belt congestion and ensure items can flow freely\n- Consider adding overflow protection or item balancing mechanisms\n\n### Resource Management\n- Multiple chests are reaching maximum capacity (iron chests with coal)\n- Implement better resource distribution logic to prevent storage bottlenecks\n- Consider adding circuit conditions or limiting chest capacities\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the world, requires clear space\n- verify_coal_transport_chain(): Validates coal transport system functionality\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- belt_right: TransportBelt\n\nSystem States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Entity is functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Entity cannot output due to full destination\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Entity lacks required input materials\n- EntityStatus.NO_FUEL: Entity requires fuel to operate"}
