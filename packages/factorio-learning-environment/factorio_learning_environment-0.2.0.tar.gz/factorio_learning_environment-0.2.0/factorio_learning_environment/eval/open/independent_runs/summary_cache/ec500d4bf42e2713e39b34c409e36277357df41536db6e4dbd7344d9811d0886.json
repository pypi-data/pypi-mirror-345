{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for electricity distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 2.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) with coal fuel\n- Wooden Chest at Position (8.5, 5.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) with copper cable recipe\n- Inserter at Position (7.5, 5.5) for material handling\n- Small Electric Poles for power distribution\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) storing iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without availability\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a boiler without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a power source. Use small electric poles to connect machines like assembling machines and inserters to the power grid.\n\n### Errors due to missing resources\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available for production processes. For example, the assembling machine requires copper plates to produce copper cables.\n\n### Errors due to entities not receiving input\n- Check that all entities, such as steam engines and boilers, have the necessary input resources, like water and fuel, to function properly."}
