{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.0, -45.5) for extracting iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -44.5) for extracting iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -45.5) for extracting iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -44.5) for extracting iron plates\n\n### Coal Supply System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple inserters and furnaces at various positions, including:\n  - Inserters at positions (-11.5, -49.5), (-9.5, -46.5), (-11.5, -44.5), and (-9.5, -44.5) for coal insertion\n  - Furnaces and other entities waiting for coal refueling\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-6.5, -49.5) for storing items\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-6.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-3.5, -48.5) for additional storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is sufficient space in your inventory before attempting to harvest resources or store items. Consider using additional storage chests if necessary.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Make sure to have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Regularly check and replenish your coal supply.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Before placing an inserter, ensure that the target position is not already occupied by another entity. Adjust the spacing or direction if necessary to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Output Blockage Errors\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or clear path for output items from furnaces and inserters to prevent blockages. Consider using belts or additional chests to manage output flow.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check the fuel status of your entities and ensure they are refueled promptly to maintain continuous operation."}
