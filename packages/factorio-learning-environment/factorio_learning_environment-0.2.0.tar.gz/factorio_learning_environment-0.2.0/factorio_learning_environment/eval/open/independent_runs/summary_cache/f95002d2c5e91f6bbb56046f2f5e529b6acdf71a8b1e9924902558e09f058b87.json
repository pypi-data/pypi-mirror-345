{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo permanent structures have been successfully placed on the map. Repeated attempts to construct the Lab at (0.5, 2.5)\u2014intended for supplying Automation Science Packs for research\u2014did not complete due to placement and resource issues. Final entity queries consistently report no built structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call and Parameter Handling Errors\n\u2003\u2013 When using get_entities, adhere strictly to its defined signature. Do not supply unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional parameters.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate the return value before iterating; if the call may return None, implement a fallback to an empty list.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Issues\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required Lab entity exists in the inventory before attempting its placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the targeted position is available and unoccupied to avoid placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Shortages\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all sub-ingredients for Lab crafting are producible: check that sufficient iron plates, iron-gear-wheels, copper plates, copper cables, and electronic circuits are available.\n\u2003\u2013 Prioritize resource acquisition and the smelting of requisite materials to satisfy intermediate production needs.\n\u2003\u2013 Reassess the crafting chain dependencies before initiating lab production to mitigate repeated failures due to missing ingredients."}
