{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Line (around position x=41-47, y=-80)\nA coal processing line consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Storage chest at (41.5, -80.5) containing coal\n- Output inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt system at (43.5, -80.5) and (44.5, -80.5) moving right\n- Furnace inserter at (45.5, -80.5) \n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -80.0)\n\nThe structure is operational but experiencing some placement issues during reconstruction attempts.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Clear items on ground before placing new entities - several placement failures occurred due to items blocking positions\n- When rebuilding a production line, ensure all previous entities are fully cleared from the area\n- Check for existing entities before placement - attempting to place transport belt where one already exists causes errors\n\n### Entity Alignment Issues\n- Ensure proper spacing between inserters and target entities\n- When placing furnaces, verify the input position aligns with inserter drop position\n- Consider using exact positioning and verification steps before finalizing placement\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Clear blocked belts to prevent upstream backlog - output inserter is waiting due to blocked belt\n- Verify belt connections and directions when reconstructing production lines\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `place_entity_next_to()`: Places an entity adjacent to a reference entity\n  - Parameters: entity type, reference position, spacing, direction\n  - Failures: Collision detection, invalid spacing, blocked positions\n  \n### Important Variables\n- `first_belt`: Position(x=43.5, y=-80.5)\n- `second_belt`: Position(x=44.5, y=-80.5)\n- `furnace_position`: Position(x=47.0, y=-80.0)\n- `inserter_position`: Position(x=45.5, y=-80.5)"}
