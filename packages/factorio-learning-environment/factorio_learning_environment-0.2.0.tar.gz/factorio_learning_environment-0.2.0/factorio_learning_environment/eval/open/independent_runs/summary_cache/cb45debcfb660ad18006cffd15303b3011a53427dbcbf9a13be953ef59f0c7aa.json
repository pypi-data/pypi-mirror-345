{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex at (-28.0, -61.0)\nComplex mining and smelting setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) connected to wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0) \n- Multiple burner inserters connecting components\n- Output wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Array at (-10.0, -59.0)\nThree burner mining drills in sequence:\n- Mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0) connected to chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0) connected to chest at (-7.5, -57.5)  \n- Mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0) connected to chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nConnected via transport belts and inserters for ore movement\n\n### Smelting Array at (0.0, 0.0)\nLarge smelting setup with:\n- 4 stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserters managing input/output\nConnected via transport belts for material movement\n\n### Power Generation Setup at (-3.5, 27.5)\nBasic power generation consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5, 22.0)\nCurrently not connected properly\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with fluid connections\n- When connecting fluid entities like boilers and pumps, ensure there are pipes between them\n- Fluid entities need direct pipe connections to function properly\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Ensure you have the required items in inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Check inventory contents before placement attempts\n\n### Errors with chest capacity\n- Monitor chest capacities, especially mining output chests\n- Empty or add more storage when chests become full to prevent production stoppage\n\n### Errors with fuel management  \n- Keep mining drills and inserters fueled to maintain operation\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner entities regularly\n\n### Errors with belt blockages\n- Clear blocked transport belts to maintain material flow\n- Ensure output paths are clear before feeding more materials"}
