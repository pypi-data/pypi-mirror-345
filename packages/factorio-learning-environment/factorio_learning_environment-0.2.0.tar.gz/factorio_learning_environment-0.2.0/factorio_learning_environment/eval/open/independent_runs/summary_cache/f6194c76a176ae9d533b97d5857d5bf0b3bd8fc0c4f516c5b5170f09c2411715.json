{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Station at (-24.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=23.5, y=-16.5) containing 59 coal\n\n###Iron Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-14.5, y=21.5) containing 355 iron ore\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Complex at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Central wooden chest (position x=20.5, y=21.5) containing 177 copper ore\n- Two burner inserters (positions x=19.5, y=21.5 and x=21.5, y=21.5) moving ore to/from the central chest\n- Stone furnace (position x=24.0, y=20.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=22.5, y=20.5) feeding the furnace\n- Output wooden chest (position x=24.5, y=17.5) containing 50 copper plates\n- Burner inserter (position x=24.5, y=18.5) moving plates to the output chest\n\n###Unused Furnaces\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- Position x=-11.0, y=20.0\n- Position x=-9.0, y=20.0\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Errors when trying to connect entities with transport belts\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests\n- Must use inserters as intermediaries between chests and belts\n- Design the layout considering that chests need inserters to interface with belt systems\n\n###Entity Status Issues\n- Several furnaces have \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- One mining drill is out of fuel\n- Ensure proper fuel supply chains and input materials are maintained\n- Consider setting up automated fuel delivery systems for burner devices\n\n###Space Management\n- Multiple entities are tightly packed around the copper processing area\n- Plan layouts with sufficient space for expansion and additional logistics\n- Leave room for belt systems and future modifications"}
