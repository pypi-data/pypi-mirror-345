{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a fuel inventory of 10 coal. This drill is actively mining iron ore and dropping it into a chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, -58.5), (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storing mined resources. The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore, while others are empty.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). These furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Furnace at (-15.0, -48.0) has 6 iron ore in its source inventory and 57 iron plates in its result inventory.\n  - Furnace at (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) have no ingredients to smelt, with 65 and 58 iron plates in their result inventories, respectively.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5).\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5).\n  - Chests at (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), and (-8.5, -50.5) are full with iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at (-5.5, -50.5) contains 790 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in mining and smelting operations. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of iron ore to maintain productivity. Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) are currently without ingredients to smelt.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int (current inventory: 10)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (current inventory: 3869)\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int (current inventory: 4)\n  - `wood`: int (current inventory: 10)"}
