{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided logs.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System (around x=40, y=-83)\nAutomated coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (40.0, -82.0)\n- Transport belt line from y=-83.5 to y=-86.5 at x=39.5\n- Fuel inserter at (40.5, -83.5) servicing the mining drill\n- Output inserter at (40.5, -87.5)\n- Collection chest at (39.5, -87.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production System (around x=46, y=-80)\nTwo parallel smelting lines consisting of:\n- Stone furnaces at (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\n- Output inserters at (45.5, -81.5) and (47.5, -81.5)\n- Collection chests at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5)\n- Input inserters at (45.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5)\n- Input chests at (45.5, -77.5) and (47.5, -77.5)\n- Additional storage chests at (49.5, -80.5) and (49.5, -79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n- When placing belts and inserters, ensure proper orientation and positioning first time to avoid repeated corrections\n- Monitor chest capacity - some chests are showing \"chest is full\" warnings\n- Keep transport belts clear to prevent mining drill blockages\n- Ensure proper fuel levels in burner devices to maintain continuous operation\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- None significant observed in provided logs\n\nFunctions:\n- None defined in provided logs\n\nSystem States:\n- Mining drill status transitions between WORKING and WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- Inserters commonly in WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS state\n- Furnaces showing NO_INGREDIENTS status when empty"}
