{"content": "It seems that I still have only 5 iron gear wheels in my inventory, which is not enough to craft the assembling machine since I need 10. \n\n### Current Inventory:\n- 10 wood\n- 5 stone\n- 10 iron ore\n- 5 copper ore\n- 5 iron plates\n- 11 copper cables\n- 5 iron gear wheels\n- 10 electronic circuits\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Gather More Iron Ore**: I need to collect more iron ore to craft additional iron gear wheels.\n2. **Craft Iron Gear Wheels**: Each iron gear wheel requires 2 iron plates. I will need to smelt more iron ore into iron plates and then craft the necessary iron gear wheels.\n\n### Gathering Iron Ore:\nI'll move to the nearest iron ore deposit and gather more iron ore.\n\n```python\n# Move to the nearest iron ore position\niron_ore_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_ore_position)  # Moving to iron ore position\nharvest_resource(iron_ore_position, quantity=10)  # Collecting more iron ore\nprint(f\"Inventory after gathering more iron ore: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\n### After Gathering Iron Ore:\nOnce I gather more iron ore, I will smelt it into iron plates and then craft the required iron gear wheels.
