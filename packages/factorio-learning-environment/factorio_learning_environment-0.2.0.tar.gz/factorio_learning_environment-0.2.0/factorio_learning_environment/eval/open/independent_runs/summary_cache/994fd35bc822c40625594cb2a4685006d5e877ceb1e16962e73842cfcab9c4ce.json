{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1) (not yet created).\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2) (not yet created).\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3) (not yet created).\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1) (not yet created).\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine (not yet created).\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1) (not yet created).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is present in the inventory before attempting to place it. The agent attempted to place a stone furnace without having it in the inventory.\n\n### Errors related to crafting requirements\n- Verify that all required ingredients for crafting an item are available in the inventory. The agent failed to craft a burner mining drill and iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates.\n\n### Errors when referencing undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them. The agent tried to reference `burner_mining_drill` before it was defined, leading to a NameError.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without the necessary machines\n- Make sure to have the appropriate crafting machines or smelting facilities available to craft items. The agent could not craft iron plates because it lacked sufficient iron plates in the furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting items from inventory\n- Ensure that the item you are trying to insert exists in your inventory. The agent attempted to insert iron ore into the stone furnace but had none in the inventory at that time.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Invoked multiple times but failed due to missing entities in inventory.\n- `craft_item`: Invoked multiple times but failed due to missing ingredients or machines.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `burner_mining_drill`: Defined after successful crafting.\n- `stone_furnace`: Defined after successful crafting.\n- `coal_patch_position`: Position of the coal patch (type: tuple).\n- `nearest_iron_ore`: Position of the nearest iron ore (type: tuple).\n- `current_inventory`: Dictionary containing items in inventory (type: dict)."}
