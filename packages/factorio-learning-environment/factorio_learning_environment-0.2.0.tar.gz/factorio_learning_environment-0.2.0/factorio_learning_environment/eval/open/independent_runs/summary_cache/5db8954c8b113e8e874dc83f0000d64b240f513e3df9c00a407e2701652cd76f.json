{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting various positions including (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), ..., (1.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 24.5), (1.5, 24.5)\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at positions (12.5, 17.5), (10.5, 19.5), (0.5, 21.5), ..., (28.5, -36.5), (26.5, -38.5), (31.5, -7.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Furnace** at position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- **Lab** with input of automation-science-pack: 28\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that all entity types are correctly defined before usage. For instance, the error \"NameError: name 'Lab' is not defined\" suggests that the entity 'Lab' was not properly defined or imported in the code. Double-check the entity definitions and imports.\n\n### Errors When Accessing Non-Existent Entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to access it. The error \"Could not get Prototype.Lab at position x=6.0 y=-62.0\" indicates that there is no lab entity at the specified position. Always confirm the presence of entities before performing operations on them."}
