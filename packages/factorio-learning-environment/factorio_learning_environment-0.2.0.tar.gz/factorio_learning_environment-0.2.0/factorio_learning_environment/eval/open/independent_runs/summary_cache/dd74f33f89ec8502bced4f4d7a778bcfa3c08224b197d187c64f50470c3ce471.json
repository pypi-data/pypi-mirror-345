{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(12.5, 13.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity poles at positions (12.5, 13.5), (15.5, 15.5), (11.5, 13.5), (20.5, 10.5), (9.5, 13.5), (10.5, 13.5)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS, Fuel: 13\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT, Fuel: 6, Source: {'copper-ore': 8}\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 2.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS, Fuel: 20\n- Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) - Inventory: {'iron-plate': 160}\n  \n### Lab at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (0, 0) - Status: NO_POWER, Research: automation\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the required ingredients to operate. Check the inventory of the furnaces regularly to avoid running out of materials.\n\n### Errors when using electricity\n- Ensure that all electrical structures are properly connected to a power source. Check the status of the electricity poles and ensure they are within range of the power network.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that you are placing entities in valid positions and that the area is not obstructed by other entities. Check for overlapping tiles and ensure you can place the entity before attempting to do so."}
