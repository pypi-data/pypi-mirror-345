{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (18.5, 75.5)\nConsists of the following entities working together to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and collect the output:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) (currently out of fuel)\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 72.5) collecting iron ore from the drill\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates (currently out of fuel and no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 73.5) (removed due to incorrect placement)\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 73.5) feeding ore into furnace (placement attempts failed)\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 74.5) extracting iron plates from furnace (out of fuel and waiting for source items)\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 75.5) collecting iron plates\n\nThis structure forms a basic iron ore mining and smelting line with input and output chests and inserters, though fuel supply and some inserter placements need correction.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Direction argument errors when placing entities\n- When placing entities requiring a direction argument, ensure the argument is of the correct Direction type, not just an integer or enum value. Use the proper Direction object from the API.\n\n### Connection failures between entities (e.g., electric poles)\n- Verify that entities exist and are correctly referenced before attempting to connect them with poles or wires.\n- Ensure the connection function handles nil or missing fields gracefully to avoid indexing errors.\n\n### Extracting items from empty or incorrect containers\n- Confirm that the container actually contains the requested item before extraction.\n- Check that the container entity is correctly identified and accessible.\n\n### Inserter placement failures due to collisions or invalid tiles\n- Before placing inserters next to entities, check for collisions with existing entities or terrain (e.g., water).\n- Increase spacing or change direction or reference position if placement fails.\n- Avoid placing multiple inserters on the same tile.\n- Remove incorrectly placed inserters promptly to prevent blocking further placements.\n\n### Fuel supply issues causing entity inactivity\n- Furnaces and burner inserters are out of fuel, causing stoppages.\n- Implement fuel insertion or automate fuel supply to keep these entities operational.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
