{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting purposes.\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) moving items from the chest to the furnace.\n- Additional Iron Chests at positions (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storage purposes.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -78.5) moving items to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Iron Chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), and (-14.5, -47.5) for storage purposes.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -49.5) for additional storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-9.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-14.5, -45.5) and (-14.5, -44.5) moving items from the chest to the furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or changing the reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure the entity you are trying to refuel exists at the specified position. Verify the entity type and position before attempting to refuel.\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Regularly check your inventory capacity to avoid errors related to full inventory. Ensure there is enough space before attempting to pick up or extract items.\n\n### Errors during supply operations\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to supply them to another entity. Check the inventory for the necessary resources before proceeding with supply operations."}
