When positioning output chests, adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions to avoid collisions with existing chests or terrain constraints.\n\n\u2022 Belt Connection and Reversed Connection Errors  \n  \u2013 Verify that connection paths between transport belts and inserters are clear and correctly aligned. Remove any interfering entities occupying critical connection points prior to attempting both standard and reversed connections.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Sub-ingredient Availability  \n  \u2013 Confirm that all required items for placement and crafting are present. Double-check that composite items (for example, crafting an iron chest) have all necessary sub-ingredients available.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Management  \n  \u2013 Monitor and maintain sufficient fuel levels for automated entities such as mining drills and inserters to prevent interruptions in operation.\n\n\u2022 Output Sink Blockage  \n  \u2013 Place sink entities (output chests) within valid buildable areas adjacent to inserter drop positions. Resolve issues where the inserter reports blockages by ensuring the sink area is unobstructed and adequately spaced."}
