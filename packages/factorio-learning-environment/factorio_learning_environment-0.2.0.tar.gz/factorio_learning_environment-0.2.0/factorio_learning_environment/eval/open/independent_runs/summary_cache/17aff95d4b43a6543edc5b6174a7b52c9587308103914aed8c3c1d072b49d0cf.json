{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with a chest at drop position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) containing 138 coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) containing 500 coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, facilitating coal transport.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) containing 1550 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) containing 500 coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n- Currently has no ingredients to smelt and contains 10 coal in its fuel inventory.\n\n### Lab\n- Lab input contains 10 automation science packs, but is currently without power.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs facilitating coal transport, including belts at positions (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5), and (x=49.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. The stone furnace at position (x=-15, y=-49) frequently encountered this issue.\n\n### Errors related to incorrect attribute access\n- Verify that the object attributes are correctly accessed. The error \"AttributeError: 'Position' object has no attribute 'name'\" suggests incorrect attribute usage.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Empty Furnace\n- Ensure that the conditions for assertions are met before executing them. The assertion that the furnace should be empty failed, indicating a mismatch between expected and actual states.\n\n### Errors when using entities with no ingredients\n- Check that all required ingredients are available before attempting to use entities like furnaces. The stone furnace at position (x=-15, y=-49) was often reported with \"no ingredients to smelt\"."}
