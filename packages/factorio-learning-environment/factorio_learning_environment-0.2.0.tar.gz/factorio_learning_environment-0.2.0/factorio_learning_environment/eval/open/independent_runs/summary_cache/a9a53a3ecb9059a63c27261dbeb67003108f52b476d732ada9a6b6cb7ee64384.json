{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5), currently working and extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0), currently working and producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to lack of inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, ensure you have a burner mining drill in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Verify that the desired location is free and suitable for the entity before placing it. This includes ensuring that the location is not occupied by another entity or is not a valid buildable area.\n\n### Furnace not producing iron plates\n- Check the setup of the furnace to ensure it has the necessary resources and fuel to operate. Ensure that the furnace is correctly connected to a source of iron ore and has sufficient fuel to maintain production.\n\n### Frequent clearing of items from drill's drop position\n- Regularly monitor and manage the drop position of drills to prevent overflow and ensure continuous operation. Consider using transport belts or inserters to automate the movement of items from the drop position."}
