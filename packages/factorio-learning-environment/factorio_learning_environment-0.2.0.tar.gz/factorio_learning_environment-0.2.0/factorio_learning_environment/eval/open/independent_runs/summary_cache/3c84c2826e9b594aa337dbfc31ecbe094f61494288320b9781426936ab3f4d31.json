{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automated Iron Smelting System (around y=-80)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- Input chest at (46.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Two parallel transport belts at (45.5, -79.5) and (47.5, -79.5) facing DOWN\n- Two input inserters at (45.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5) moving items from input chest to belts\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0) facing UP\n- Two output inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) facing UP\n- Output chests at (45.5, -84.5) and (46.5, -83.5)\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (around y=-82)\nMining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n- Additional coal storage in wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5)\n- Overflow coal storage chest at (49.5, -79.5) also containing iron plates\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is already occupied by another entity\n- When placing inserters or belts, ensure the target position is clear of other structures\n\n### System Configuration Issues\n- When setting up automated systems, verify the correct orientation of:\n  - Furnaces (should face UP to receive from belts)\n  - Inserters (output inserters should face UP to pick from furnaces)\n  - Transport belts (should face DOWN for proper flow)\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `left_output_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `right_output_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `left_belt`: TransportBelt\n- `right_belt`: TransportBelt\n- `left_furnace`: Furnace\n- `right_furnace`: Furnace\n\n### System States\n- All inserters currently in WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS state\n- Furnaces in NO_INGREDIENTS state\n- Transport belts in WORKING state but empty\n- Input chest contains 19 iron ore\n- Output chests empty\n- All burner inserters have 49 coal as fuel\n- Furnaces have 50 coal as fuel"}
