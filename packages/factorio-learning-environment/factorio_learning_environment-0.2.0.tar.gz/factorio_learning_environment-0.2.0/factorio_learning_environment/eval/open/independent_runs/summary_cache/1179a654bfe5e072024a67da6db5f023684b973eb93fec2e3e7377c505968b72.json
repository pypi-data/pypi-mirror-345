{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n\nThis facility is designed to extract iron ore and process it into iron plates. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into the wooden chest. The stone furnace is used to smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Ensure there is enough space and the correct orientation when placing a Burner Inserter. The inserter must be placed adjacent to the entity it is intended to interact with, such as a chest or furnace.\n\n### NameError: Undefined Variables\n- Double-check the variable names used in your code. Ensure that all variables are defined before they are used. Consider using auto-complete features or referencing existing variable names to avoid typos.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a Wooden Chest\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from a wooden chest to a belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to a wooden chest without an inserter.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid such errors.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Consider using inserters to automate the transfer of items from full chests to other entities.\n\n### Warnings about no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply the furnace with the required raw materials to maintain production efficiency."}
