{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) mining coal. It is fueled and operational but has a warning indicating the output is blocked.\n- A series of transport belts connected to the Burner Mining Drill, facilitating the movement of mined coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. It is currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients.\n- BeltGroup connecting various belts to facilitate the movement of materials.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups and individual belts:\n- Various belts positioned at (50.5, -86.5), (54.5, -86.5), (52.5, -82.5), and (53.5, -83.5) with different directions (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, UP) to transport items across the map.\n- BeltGroups are configured to connect different parts of the map, ensuring efficient transportation of resources.\n\n### Inserter Setup\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) configured to pick up items from a belt at position (53.5, -83.5) and drop them at position (55.5, -83.5).\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) for storing items, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Placing Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure that the target location for placing a Burner Mining Drill is clear of obstacles and is not on unplaceable terrain like water.\n- Verify that the configuration parameters for the Burner Mining Drill, such as height and width, are valid integers.\n\n### Errors in Configuring Burner Mining Drill\n- Double-check the entity type and ensure that the correct prototype is being referenced when configuring the Burner Mining Drill.\n- Address any warnings related to the output being blocked by ensuring there is a sink entity to accept the output.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, verify that the location is suitable and free from other entities or terrain issues that might prevent placement."}
