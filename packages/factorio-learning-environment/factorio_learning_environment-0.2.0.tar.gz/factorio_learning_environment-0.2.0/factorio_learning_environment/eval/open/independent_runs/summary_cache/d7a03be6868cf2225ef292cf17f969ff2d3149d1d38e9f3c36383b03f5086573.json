Verify that the candidate pipe group is accurately positioned and that its fluid_system id matches the active pipeline network configuration.\n  - Previous failures with candidate pipe groups (fluid_system ids 90666, 90748, 90832, 90914, 90998, 91164, 91246, 91330, 91412, 91578, 91662, 91744, 91828) highlight the need to validate the existence and placement of pipe groups before attempting connection."}
