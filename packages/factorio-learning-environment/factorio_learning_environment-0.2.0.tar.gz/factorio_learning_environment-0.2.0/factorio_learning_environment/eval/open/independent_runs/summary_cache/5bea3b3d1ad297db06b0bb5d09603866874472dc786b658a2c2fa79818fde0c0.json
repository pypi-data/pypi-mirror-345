{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures created on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but no successful placements have been recorded. Therefore, no existing structures can be summarized at this time.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and valid for the entity type before attempting to place an entity. This will prevent placement errors such as:\n  - \"Cannot place a Transport Belt at x=65.0 y=-105.0.\"\n  - \"Cannot place a Stone Furnace at x=5.0 y=5.0.\"\n  - \"Cannot place a Burner Inserter at x=-50.0 y=50.0.\"\n  - \"Cannot place a Wooden Chest at x=0.0 y=10.0.\"\n  - \"Cannot place a Wooden Chest at x=10.0 y=0.0.\"\n  - \"Cannot place a Burner Inserter at x=-100.0 y=100.0.\"\n  - \"Cannot place a Wooden Chest at x=0.0 y=0.0.\"\n\nThese errors suggest that the agent should verify the placement location is suitable for the intended entity to avoid repeated placement failures."}
