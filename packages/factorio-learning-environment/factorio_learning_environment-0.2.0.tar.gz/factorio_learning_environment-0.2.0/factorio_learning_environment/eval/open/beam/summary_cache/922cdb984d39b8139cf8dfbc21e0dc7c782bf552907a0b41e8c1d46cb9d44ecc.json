{"content": "I now understand the key issues:\n\n1. We cannot craft wooden chests because:\n   - Wood is a raw resource that must be gathered, not crafted\n   - We have no wood in our inventory\n\n2. We cannot craft iron chests because:\n   - While we have 1 iron plate, we need a specific crafting machine\n   - Iron plates need to be smelted in a furnace\n\nGiven these limitations, here's what we can do:\n\n```python\n# Check our current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inspect()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Since we can't craft chests right now, let's focus on the drill\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Found drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Add coal to the drill if it needs fuel\nif drill.status == EntityStatus.NO_FUEL:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n\n# Verify drill status\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\n```\n\nRecommendations for future attempts:\n1. We need to gather wood from trees before we can craft wooden chests\n2. We need a furnace to smelt iron plates before we can craft iron chests\n3. We should check if we have the required crafting facilities before attempting to craft items\n4. We should verify raw resource requirements and gathering methods before attempting crafting\n\nWould you like me to try a different approach, such as:\n1. Finding and gathering wood from nearby trees\n2. Setting up a furnace for iron plate production\n3. Or working with the existing drill setup without a chest?", "summary_range": "[1-2752]"}
