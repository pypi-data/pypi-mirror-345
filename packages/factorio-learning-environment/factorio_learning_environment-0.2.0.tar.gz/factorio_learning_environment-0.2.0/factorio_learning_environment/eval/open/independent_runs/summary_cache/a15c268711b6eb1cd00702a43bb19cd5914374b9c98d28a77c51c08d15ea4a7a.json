{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with a full inventory of coal (50/50) and producing iron plates (5 in inventory).\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) with an inventory containing iron ore (606).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) currently out of fuel and unable to extract resources. It has a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5) which is full.\n\n### Additional Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing iron ore (661) and iron plates (100).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target entity has available space before attempting to insert items. In this case, the stone furnace was full and could not accept more coal.\n\n### Errors related to mining drill fuel\n- The Burner Mining Drill is out of fuel. Make sure to keep an adequate supply of fuel available for the mining drill to function properly.\n\n### Repeated errors in coal insertion\n- The same error regarding the inability to insert coal into the stone furnace occurred multiple times. This indicates a consistent issue with inventory management. Regularly check inventory levels before attempting to insert items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item_type, target_entity, quantity)`: This function has encountered failures due to full inventories, particularly with the stone furnace.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: type - Furnace\n- `wooden_chest_1`: type - Chest\n- `burner_mining_drill`: type - BurnerMiningDrill\n- `wooden_chest_2`: type - Chest\n- `inventory`: type - Inventory (various items including 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'coal')"}
