{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler, with pipes at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-6.5, 23.5), ..., (-4.5, 23.5), (-5.5, 23.5), (-4.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Water\n- Ensure that the area where you are trying to place an entity is not occupied by water or other entities. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position for placement.\n\n### Type Errors in Building Box Calculations\n- When calculating dimensions for building boxes, ensure that you are using compatible data types. Avoid adding 'ModelPrivateAttr' to integers directly.\n\n### Name Errors for Undefined Variables\n- Before using variables like 'steam_engine_buildable_area' or 'steam_engine', ensure they are properly defined and initialized.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure you have all the necessary ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting pipes requires iron plates, which must be available in sufficient quantities.\n\n### Insertion Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are present in your inventory. For instance, inserting coal into a boiler requires coal to be available.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the items you wish to extract. For example, make sure the stone furnace contains iron plates before attempting extraction."}
