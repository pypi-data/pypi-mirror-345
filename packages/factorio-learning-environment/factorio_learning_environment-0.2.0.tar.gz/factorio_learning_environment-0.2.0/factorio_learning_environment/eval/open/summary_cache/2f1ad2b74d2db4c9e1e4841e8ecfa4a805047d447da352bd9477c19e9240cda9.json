{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position 17.5, 72.5) facing down\n- Small electric pole (position 17.5, 69.5) placed to provide power\n- Connected to power network via extended small electric poles reaching steam engine power source\n\n### Steam power generation setup near position (0.5, 6.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler (position -5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, connected to offshore pump with pipes\n- Steam engine (position 0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler with pipes\n- Small electric poles placed near steam engine (0.5, 3.5) and boiler (-4.5, -0.5) to distribute power\n\n### Iron ore smelting area near position (18.0, 75.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, smelting iron ore from mining drill\n- Wooden chest (position 19.5, 75.5) placed to collect iron plates from furnace output\n- Burner inserter (position 20.5, 75.5) moving iron plates from furnace to chest with spacing=1\n- Small electric pole (position 15.5, 75.5) placed near furnace to provide power, connected to power network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inserting items into entities\n- Avoid attempting to insert items into entities that do not accept them or when the entity is full.\n- Check entity inventory capacity before inserting items to prevent LuaItemStack insertion exceptions.\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of electricity groups\n- ElectricityGroup objects do not have an 'energy' attribute; instead, check power availability by querying individual poles or power sources.\n- Use correct API calls to verify power status of electric poles or connected power entities.\n\n### Errors placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify the target tile is unoccupied.\n- If placement fails due to existing entity, consider changing position, increasing spacing, or changing placement direction.\n- For example, wooden chest placement failed at (19.5, 75.5) due to existing chest; burner inserter placement next to furnace also failed due to chest occupying the spot.\n\n### Errors placing entities next to others with insufficient spacing\n- When placing entities adjacent to others, ensure spacing and direction allow for free placement.\n- If placement fails, increase spacing or choose a different direction or reference position.\n- For instance, small electric pole placement near furnace failed due to electric mining drill occupying the intended tile; increase spacing or reposition.\n\n### Power network connection and entity power status\n- Electric mining drill initially was not powered due to lack of connection to power source.\n- Ensure power poles are properly connected to active power sources such as steam engines or solar panels.\n- Verify power network connectivity after placing poles to avoid NO_POWER status.\n\n### Furnace output blockage\n- Electric mining drill output was blocked due to no sink entity to accept mined items.\n- Place chests or belts to receive output from mining drills to prevent blockage and allow continuous operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
