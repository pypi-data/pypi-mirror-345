{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) to transfer iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) to transfer iron plates from the furnace to a storage chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Secondary Iron Ore Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nThis facility is an additional smelting setup for processing iron ore into iron plates. It includes:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -45.5) for transferring items to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operations\n- **Inserter Waiting for Source Items**: Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and replenish source inventories to avoid idle inserters.\n- **Furnace Belt at Drop Position is Blocked**: Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not blocked. Regularly clear output paths and storage to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- **No Ingredients to Smelt**: Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly supply furnaces with raw materials to maintain production.\n\n### Errors in API Usage\n- **Incorrect Argument Type in Function Call**: When using functions like `inspect_inventory`, ensure that the correct argument type is passed. Use an Entity or Position object instead of an integer to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- **Could Not Insert: No Coal to Insert from Inventory**: Ensure that you have sufficient resources in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines or entities. Regularly check and manage your inventory to avoid resource shortages."}
