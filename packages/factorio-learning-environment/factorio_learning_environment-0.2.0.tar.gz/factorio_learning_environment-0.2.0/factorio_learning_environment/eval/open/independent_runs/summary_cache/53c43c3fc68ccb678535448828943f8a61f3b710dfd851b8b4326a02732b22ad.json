{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(1.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric pole (position (1.5, 3.5)) \n- Electric pole (position (6.5, 3.5))\n- Electric pole (position (6.5, 4.5))\n- Electric pole (position (2.5, 1.5))\n\n### Stone furnace at position(1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with status: EntityStatus.WORKING\n- Chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) containing iron plates\n- Chest (position (3.5, 3.5)) containing iron plates\n- Chest (position (3.5, 5.5)) with no inventory\n\n### Lab at position(3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (3.5, 3.5)) with status: EntityStatus.NO_POWER\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Ensure that electric poles are properly connected to the electric network. Check the positioning and ensure they are not too far apart or obstructed by other entities.\n\n### Errors when trying to connect to the stone furnace\n- Verify that the stone furnace has power before attempting to connect. If it shows EntityStatus.NO_POWER, check the connections and ensure that the electric poles are correctly placed and functional.\n\n### Attribute errors in code\n- When accessing attributes of objects, ensure that the object is of the correct type. In this case, check that 'electricity_group' is being used correctly as a list and not as an object with attributes like 'poles'.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure that entities are placed in valid positions and are not overlapping with existing structures. Always check the status of the entity after placement to confirm it is functioning as intended."}
