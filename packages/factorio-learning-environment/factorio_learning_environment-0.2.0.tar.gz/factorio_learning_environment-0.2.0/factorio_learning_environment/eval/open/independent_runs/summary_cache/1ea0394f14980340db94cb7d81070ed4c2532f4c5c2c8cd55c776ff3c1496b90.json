Consider emptying the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the provided logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `fuel`: Inventory type, used for tracking fuel in entities like burner mining drills and furnaces.\n  - `inventory`: Inventory type, used for tracking contents of chests and other storage entities.\n  - `position`: Position type, used for specifying the location of entities on the map."}
