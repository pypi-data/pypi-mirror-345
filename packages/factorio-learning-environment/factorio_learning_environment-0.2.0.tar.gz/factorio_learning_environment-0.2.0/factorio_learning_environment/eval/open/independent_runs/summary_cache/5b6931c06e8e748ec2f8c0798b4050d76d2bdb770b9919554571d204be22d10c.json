{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions (20.5, -10.5), (21.5, -10.5), (22.5, -10.5), etc.\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (24.5, -6.5) and (24.5, -7.5), providing electrical connections.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) supplying resources.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) with a source of copper ore.\n- Inserter at Position (7.5, 5.5) moving items from the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (8.5, 5.5) for storage.\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace to the assembling machine, with belts at positions (10.5, 4.5) to (10.5, 6.5).\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) producing copper cables.\n- Inserter at Position (9.5, 5.5) feeding copper plates into the assembling machine.\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) to the assembling machine at Position (10.5, 0.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure you have copper ore in your inventory before inserting it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entity has the required items before the inserter attempts to move them. This can be resolved by ensuring the source entity is correctly supplied with materials.\n\n### Errors with Assembling Machines Missing Resources\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has all the necessary resources in its input to craft the desired item. For instance, make sure copper plates are available for the assembling machine to produce copper cables."}
