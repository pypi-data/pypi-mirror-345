{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at Position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -86.0)\n- **Transport Belt** at position (41.5, -84.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (43.5, -84.5)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at Position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-17.0, -52.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-16.5, -50.5)\n\n#### Furnace Setup at Position (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-13.5, -51.5)\n\n#### Furnace Setup at Position (-15.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -51.0)\n\n#### Furnace Setup at Position (43.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -79.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (43.5, -76.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to get an entity that does not exist\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. For example, the agent tried to get a **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5), but no such entity exists there.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Check the inventory capacity of the target entity before inserting items. For example, the agent attempted to insert coal into a **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0), but the furnace's inventory was already full.\n\n#### Errors when mining due to blocked or full drop positions\n- Ensure the drop position for mining drills is clear and not blocked by other entities. For example, the **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -86.0) is blocked by a transport belt at (41.5, -84.5).\n- Empty the chest at the drop position if it is full. For example, the **Burner Mining Drill** at position (43.0, -86.0) is unable to drop coal because the chest at (43.5, -84.5) is full.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **get_entity(Prototype, Position)**: Retrieves an entity of the specified prototype at the given position. Fails if no such entity exists.\n- **insert_item(Prototype, Entity, quantity)**: Inserts a specified quantity of an item into an entity's inventory. Fails if the inventory is full or the entity cannot accept the item.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **blocked_inserter**: Attempted to store a **Burner Inserter** entity, but the retrieval failed due to the entity not existing at the specified position.\n- **furnace**: Used to interact with a **Stone Furnace** entity. Encountered an error when attempting to insert coal into a full furnace."}
