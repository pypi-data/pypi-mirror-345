{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) which is currently out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5) which is out of fuel and waiting for source items. It is connected to the stone furnace and is responsible for feeding materials into it.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup 1: Inputs from Belt at (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) with direction RIGHT; Outputs from Belt at (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5) with direction RIGHT.\n- BeltGroup 2: Inputs from Belt at (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5) with direction RIGHT; Outputs from Belt at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5) with direction UP.\n- BeltGroup 3: Inputs from Belt at (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) with direction LEFT; Outputs from Belt at (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5) with direction RIGHT.\n- BeltGroup 4: Inputs from Belt at (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-52.5) with direction UP; Outputs from Belt at (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5) with direction UP.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Path Creation\n- Ensure that the path for the transport belt is valid and can be normalized. Check for obstacles or incorrect connections that might prevent the belt from connecting between the specified positions.\n\n### Low Iron Plate Production\n- Investigate the supply chain for iron plate production. Ensure that the furnace is fueled and has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check if the inserter is properly fueled and operational to feed materials into the furnace.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as furnaces and burner inserters, are adequately supplied with fuel to maintain continuous operation."}
