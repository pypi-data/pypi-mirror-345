{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Smelting Setup at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- First furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Second furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nBoth furnaces are currently without fuel and not operational.\n\n###Copper and Iron Mining/Smelting Setup with Collection System at position(-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- First burner mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0), rotated downward\n- Second burner mining drill at position (-26.0, -61.0), rotated downward\n- First furnace at position (-27.0, -58.0)\n- Second furnace at position (-25.0, -58.0)\n- Collection system for copper furnace:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-26.5, -56.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position (-26.5, -55.5)\n- Collection system for iron furnace:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-24.5, -56.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position (-24.5, -55.5)\nAll entities are currently without fuel and not operational.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when trying to place entities in already occupied positions\n- Before placing furnaces or other entities, verify the target position is completely free\n- Check if any entity's working area or drop position overlaps with the intended placement location\n- Consider the full tile dimensions of both existing and new entities when planning placement\n\n### Errors when trying to place inserters in invalid positions\n- When placing inserters next to mining drills, ensure the position doesn't conflict with the drill's drop position\n- Consider the tile dimensions and working area of existing entities before placing inserters\n- For mining drills, the drop position is a critical operational point and cannot be blocked by other entities\n- When placing inserters, ensure there's enough clearance from other entities' working areas\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces or drills, try increasing the spacing parameter if initial placement fails\n\n### Errors related to entity spacing and direction\n- When using place_entity_next_to, carefully consider the spacing parameter\n- If placement fails, try increasing the spacing value\n- Consider alternative directions when the desired placement direction is blocked\n- Verify that the reference position and direction combination will result in a valid placement\n\n### Errors related to class references and imports\n- When referencing entity classes like 'Furnace', ensure proper imports are in place\n- Use the full qualified name (e.g., factorio_entities.Furnace) if the class is not imported\n- Check for typos in class names and import statements\n\n### Errors related to crafting requirements\n- Check if the item requires a crafting machine or furnace before attempting to craft\n- For items like iron plates that need smelting, use furnaces instead of trying to craft them directly\n- Ensure all sub-ingredients are available or can be crafted before attempting to craft complex items\n- Verify the crafting prerequisites and required facilities for each recipe\n- When crafting items that require multiple steps (like iron gear wheels requiring iron plates), ensure the base materials are properly smelted first\n\n### Errors related to inventory management and item extraction\n- Always verify required items are in inventory before attempting to place or insert them\n- Keep track of inventory contents, especially when placing multiple entities\n- When extracting items from entities, ensure the items have been fully produced before attempting extraction\n- Wait for smelting/processing to complete before attempting to extract products\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Monitor fuel levels of all powered entities (mining drills, inserters, furnaces)\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available before starting a refueling operation\n- Complete refueling operations for all entities in one pass to maintain efficiency\n- Keep track of coal consumption rates to maintain continuous operation\n- Implement a systematic refueling routine to keep all entities operational\n- Verify coal is in inventory before attempting to refuel entities\n\n### Errors when trying to reference non-existent entities\n- When using place_entity_next_to, ensure the reference entity position exists and is valid\n- Double check coordinates when referencing entity positions\n- Verify entity existence before attempting to use it as a reference point"}
