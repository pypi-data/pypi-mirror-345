{"content": "Here is the updated report based on the execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around x=41-47, y=-80 to -82)\nComplex system for mining and transporting coal consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting mined coal\n- Output burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt system from (43.5, -80.5) to (44.5, -80.5)\n- Furnace inserter at (45.5, -80.5) moving items from belt to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -80.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing entities\n- Check for existing objects that may block placement of new entities\n- When extending belt systems, verify sufficient clear space is available\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Belt systems getting blocked frequently, requiring regular clearing and rebuilding\n- Consider adding more buffer space between components\n- Monitor belt throughput and adjust system accordingly\n\n### Component Configuration\n- Verify inserter pickup/drop positions are correctly configured before operation\n- Ensure proper orientation of all components in the production line\n- Keep components properly fueled to maintain continuous operation\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails if target location is occupied.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- belt_group: BeltGroup type containing belt system status and inventory\n- furnace_status: EntityStatus enum indicating furnace operational state\n- chest_inventory: Dictionary tracking items in wooden chest\n- entity_positions: Dictionary mapping entities to their coordinates"}
