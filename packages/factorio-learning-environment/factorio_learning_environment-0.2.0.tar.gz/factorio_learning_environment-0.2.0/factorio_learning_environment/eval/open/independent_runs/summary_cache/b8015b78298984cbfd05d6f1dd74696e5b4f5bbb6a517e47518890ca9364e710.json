Before crafting, ensure all necessary sub-ingredients are available in the inventory. For burner-mining-drill, the agent needs iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel and stone-furnace. For stone-furnace, the agent needs stone.\n- The agent attempts to craft iron-gear-wheel and burner-mining-drill without having iron-plate. Smelt iron-ore into iron-plate in a furnace before crafting these items.\n- The agent attempts to craft items (stone-furnace) from raw resources (stone). Stone must be harvested before crafting.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- The agent attempts to place a burner mining drill without having one in its inventory.
