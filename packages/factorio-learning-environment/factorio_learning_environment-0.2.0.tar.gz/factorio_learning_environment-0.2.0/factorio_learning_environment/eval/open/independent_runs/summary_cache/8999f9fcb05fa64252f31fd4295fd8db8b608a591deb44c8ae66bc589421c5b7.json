{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. It consists of:\n*   Offshore Pump at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n*   Pipes connecting the pump to the boiler (PipeGroup starting at x=-8.5, y=-0.5)\n*   Boiler at (x=-5.0, y=2.5) - Currently fueled with coal.\n*   Pipes connecting the boiler to the steam engine (PipeGroup starting at x=-6.5, y=3.5)\n*   Steam Engine (Generator) at (x=0.5, y=6.5) - Currently not connected to the power network and lacks steam.\n*   Initial power poles placed near the steam engine (ElectricityGroup id=26615, poles at x=0.5, y=4.5; x=4.5, y=4.5; etc.)\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Setup at Position (x=22.5, y=8.5) to (x=26.5, y=19.5)\nThis structure is designed to mine coal, smelt it into iron plates (although currently configured incorrectly for coal smelting), and assemble iron gear wheels. It is currently not operational due to lack of power and incorrect furnace setup (smelting coal instead of iron ore).\nIt consists of the following entities:\n*   Electric Mining Drill at (x=22.5, y=8.5) targeting coal.\n*   Electric Mining Drill at (x=25.5, y=8.5) targeting coal.\n*   Stone Furnace at (x=23.0, y=11.0) - Intended for smelting, currently has"}
