{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\n- **Iron Ore Mining at Position (-15.0, -50.0)**\n  - Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory of coal.\n  - Two Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storage.\n  - A Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) for transferring mined ore.\n\n- **Iron Smelting at Position (-12.0, -48.0)**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from chest to furnace.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -46.5) collecting iron plates.\n\n#### Additional Storage\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- **Inserter Waiting for Source Items**\n  - Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly refuel and check the source entities to prevent stoppages.\n  \n- **Inserter Drop Position Blocked**\n  - Ensure that the destination for the inserter's drop is clear and has space for the items being transferred. Regularly clear blockages to maintain smooth operations.\n\n#### Errors in Item Extraction\n- **Failed to Extract Items from Furnace**\n  - Verify that the furnace has the required items available for extraction. Ensure that the extraction logic correctly references the furnace and the item quantities.\n  \n- **Incorrect Extraction Quantity**\n  - When extracting items, ensure the quantity specified is available in the source entity to prevent extraction errors. Adjust extraction logic to handle available quantities dynamically."}
