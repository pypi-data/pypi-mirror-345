{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with warnings of being out of fuel and full chest at drop position.\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions, storing iron ore and iron plates:\n  - Chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) contains iron ore.\n  - Chests at positions (5.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5), and (8.5, y=-60.5) contain iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (-5.5, y=-52.5) contains iron ore.\n  - Chests at positions (-14.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), and (-12.5, y=-50.5) contain iron ore.\n  - Chests at positions (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), (-8.5, y=-50.5), (-7.5, y=-50.5), and (-6.5, y=-50.5) contain iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-6.5, y=-50.5) and (-5.5, y=-50.5), storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel, currently working, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - (-13.0, y=-48.0) and (-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel, but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that all mining drills and furnaces have a sufficient supply of fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly empty chests that are used as drop-off points for mining drills to prevent halting of mining operations.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials (such as iron ore) to keep them operational.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `iron_ore`: int, extracted and inserted into furnaces.\n  - `iron_plate`: int, stored in chests and furnaces.\n  - `coal`: int, used as fuel in furnaces."}
