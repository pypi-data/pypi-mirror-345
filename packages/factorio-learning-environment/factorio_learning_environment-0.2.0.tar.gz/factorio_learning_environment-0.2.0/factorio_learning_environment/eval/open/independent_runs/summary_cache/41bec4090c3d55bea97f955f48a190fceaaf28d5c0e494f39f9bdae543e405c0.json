{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer Station at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the chest at (42.5, -83.5) to the chest at (40.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) used for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) storing coal for the furnace at (61.0, -54.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) storing coal for the furnace at (64.0, -53.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) storing coal for the furnace at (64.0, -53.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Currently, furnaces at positions (61.0, -54.0) and (64.0, -53.0) are showing warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt.\" Regularly check and supply the required raw materials to maintain continuous production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
