{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (1, 1)) with fuel (coal) and currently processing copper-ore into copper-plate.\n\n### Wooden chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) containing 20 iron-plates.\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 3.5)) containing 50 iron-plates.\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 5.5)) with no items.\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (6.5, 1.5)) currently without power.\n\n### Small electric pole at position (6.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position (6.5, 3.5)) providing power to the lab.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to insufficient ingredients\n- Ensure you have enough required ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft items. In this case, ensure you have enough copper-plates to craft Automation Science Packs.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Check the inventory of the target entity (like a furnace) before inserting items. If the inventory is full, you will not be able to insert additional items.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items that are not available\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. In this case, ensure you have copper-ore before trying to insert it into the furnace.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert incompatible items\n- Verify that the item you are trying to insert is compatible with the target entity's inventory. In this case, ensure you are not trying to insert copper-ore into a furnace that already contains iron-ore.\n\n### Errors when monitoring research progress\n- Ensure that the research lab is placed correctly on the map and is accessible. If there are no labs available, you will not be able to monitor research progress.\n\n### Errors when trying to find the nearest lab\n- Make sure that at least one lab is built and placed on the map before attempting to find the nearest lab. If no labs exist, the operation will fail.\n\n### Errors when crafting a lab\n- Ensure that you have the correct materials required to craft the lab. Check your inventory for the necessary components.\n\n### Errors with unsupported operand types\n- Verify that you are using the correct data types in calculations. For instance, ensure that you are not trying to add incompatible types, such as a model attribute and an integer.\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that there is a suitable position available for placing electric poles. Check for existing objects in the way before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when connecting to power sources\n- Ensure that the lab is within range of a power source. If the lab status indicates no power, check the connections and ensure poles are correctly placed to provide power."}
