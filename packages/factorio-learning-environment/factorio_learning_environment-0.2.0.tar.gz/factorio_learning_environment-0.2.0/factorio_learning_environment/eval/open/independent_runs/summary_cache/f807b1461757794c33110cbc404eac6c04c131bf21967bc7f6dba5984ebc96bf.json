{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the desired location for placing an entity is unoccupied and valid before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities or terrain that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Verify the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by checking the map or using appropriate API calls to confirm the entity's presence.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new positions\n- Confirm that the target position is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity. This involves checking for other entities or obstacles that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting actions that consume them, such as inserting fuel or constructing entities.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Address warnings related to blocked outputs by ensuring there is a sink entity or appropriate storage to accept the output from production entities like drills or furnaces."}
