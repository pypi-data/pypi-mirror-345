{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., wooden chest) contains the items you wish to extract before attempting extraction. Verify the entity's inventory to prevent extraction errors.\n\n### Errors due to full chest\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at the drop position to avoid mining interruptions. Ensure there is sufficient space in the chest for continued operation of the mining drill.\n\n### Errors when refueling\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Plan refueling activities in advance to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors when positioning inserters\n- Ensure inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities efficiently. Verify their orientation and connection to both source and destination entities."}
