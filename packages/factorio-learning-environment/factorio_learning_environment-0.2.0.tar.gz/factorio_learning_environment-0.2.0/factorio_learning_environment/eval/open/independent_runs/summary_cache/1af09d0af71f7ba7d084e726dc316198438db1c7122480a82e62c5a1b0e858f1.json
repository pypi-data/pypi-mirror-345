{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (0.5, 28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Boiler at Position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Connected to the electricity network with poles at various positions\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (40.0, -84.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (40.5, -82.5)\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (40.5, -82.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (54.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -80.5) for transferring items\n- Iron Chests at Positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) for additional coal and iron plate storage\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Research Lab at Position (5.5, 5.5)\n- Lab connected to the power source, currently not receiving power\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs for coal transportation at various positions\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Referencing Entities\n- Ensure correct usage of entity references. Use 'entities.Lab' instead of 'Lab' to avoid NameError.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that all necessary pipes are in place and correctly connected to avoid connection failures between boilers and steam engines.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and other fuel-dependent entities.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity into a tile before attempting to place it."}
