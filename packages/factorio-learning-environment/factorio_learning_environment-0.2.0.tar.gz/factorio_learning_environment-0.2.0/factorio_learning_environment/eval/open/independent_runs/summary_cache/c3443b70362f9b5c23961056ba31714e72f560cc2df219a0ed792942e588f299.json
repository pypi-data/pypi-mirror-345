{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Plate Production Line at y=1.0\nConsists of three stone furnaces with automated output collection:\n- Stone furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) - currently idle\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) - currently idle\n- Burner inserter at position (1.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from first furnace, 49 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (3.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from second furnace, 38 coal\n- Collection chest at position (1.5, 3.5) - containing 69 iron plates\n- Collection chest at position (3.5, 3.5) - containing 63 iron plates\n- Collection system addition:\n  - Collection chest at position (5.5, 3.5) - empty\n  - Burner inserter at position (5.5, 2.5) with 19 coal, waiting for source items\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line at y=7.0\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel with automated output collection:\n- Stone furnace at position (2.0, 7.0) - currently idle\n- Stone furnace at position (4.0, 7.0) - currently idle\n- Burner inserter at position (2.5, 8.5) - configured to extract from first furnace, 36 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (4.5, 8.5) - configured to extract from second furnace, 18 coal\n- Collection chest at position (2.5, 9.5) - containing 76 copper plates\n- Collection chest at position (4.5, 9.5) - containing 87 copper plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Check inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Ensure you have crafted or collected the required items before placement\n- For complex items like offshore pumps, verify all sub-components are available or can be crafted\n\n### Errors with complex crafting dependencies\n- Plan the crafting sequence for items with multiple dependencies\n- For items requiring electronic circuits:\n  1. First ensure copper plates are available (requires smelting)\n  2. Craft copper cables from copper plates\n  3. Create electronic circuits from copper cables\n  4. Then proceed with final item crafting\n\n### Errors when placing entities in invalid locations\n- Verify the target location is valid before placing entities\n- Some locations may be blocked by other entities or terrain\n- Consider checking if the target position overlaps with existing structures\n- Use appropriate spacing between entities to avoid placement conflicts\n\n### Errors with resource management\n- Keep track of resource quantities in inventory\n- Ensure sufficient resources are collected before attempting to supply multiple machines\n- Consider collecting additional resources when inventory runs low on critical items\n- Craft required building components before starting new construction projects\n\n### Errors with chest capacity\n- Monitor chest capacity as some inserters are showing \"chest is full\" warnings\n- Consider emptying or replacing full chests to maintain production flow\n- Plan for chest management when production lines are running for extended periods"}
