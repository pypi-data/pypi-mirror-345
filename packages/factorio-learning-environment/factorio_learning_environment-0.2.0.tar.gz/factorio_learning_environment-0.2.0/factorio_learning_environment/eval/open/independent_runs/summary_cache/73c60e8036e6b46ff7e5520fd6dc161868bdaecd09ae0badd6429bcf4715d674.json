{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n  - Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n  - Iron Chest at position (42.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) facilitating transfer between chests and furnace\n- Multiple Iron Chests at positions (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to:\n  - Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5)\n- Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-11.5, -49.5), (-10.5, -49.5), (-8.5, -49.5), and (-7.5, -48.5) for handling materials\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-12.5, -49.5), (-9.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -45.5), and (-10.5, -45.5) for storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that the upstream supply of items is sufficient to keep the inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) active. Regularly check and supply resources to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Full Chests Blocking Mining Operations\n- Regularly clear out chests at drop positions such as (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) to prevent mining drills from halting due to full inventories.\n\n### Furnace Output Blocked\n- Ensure that the output of furnaces is regularly cleared to prevent the status of \"FULL_OUTPUT\" and \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" which can halt production. This involves regularly checking and emptying the output chests or ensuring there is space for the output items.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure the destination for inserters is not blocked. This can be achieved by ensuring that the destination chests or belts have enough space to accommodate the items being transferred."}
