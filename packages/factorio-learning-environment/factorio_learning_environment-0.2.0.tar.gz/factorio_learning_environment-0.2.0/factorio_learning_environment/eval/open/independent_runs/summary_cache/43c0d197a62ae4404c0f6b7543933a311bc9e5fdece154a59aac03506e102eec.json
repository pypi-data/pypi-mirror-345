{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### First furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a full inventory of coal (50) and producing iron plates.\n\n### Iron ore mine at position (-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of:\n- The agent harvested iron ore from this patch.\n\n### Additional furnaces\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone furnace (position 4.0, 0.0) with a full inventory of coal (50) and no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone furnace (position 6.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (8.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest with an empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace. For example, you encountered errors when trying to insert iron ore and coal when they were not available.\n\n### Errors when the furnace inventory is full\n- Check the inventory of the furnace before inserting items. If the furnace is full, you will not be able to add more items. This was observed multiple times when attempting to add coal.\n\n### Errors when harvesting resources\n- Make sure to harvest enough resources before attempting to use them in crafting or smelting processes. You faced issues with not having enough iron plates to craft iron gear wheels.\n\n### General inventory management\n- Regularly monitor your inventory to ensure you have a sufficient supply of necessary materials for crafting and smelting. This will help avoid interruptions in production."}
