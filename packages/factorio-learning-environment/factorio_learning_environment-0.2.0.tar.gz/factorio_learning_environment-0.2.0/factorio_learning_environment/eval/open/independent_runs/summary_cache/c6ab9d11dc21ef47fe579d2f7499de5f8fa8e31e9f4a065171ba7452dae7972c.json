{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around position x=41-44, y=-80 to -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest (position x=41.5, y=-80.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter (position x=42.5, y=-80.5) for transferring materials\n- Stone furnace (position x=44.0, y=-81.0)\n\nThe system is partially operational with:\n- Mining drill actively working with coal fuel\n- Chest successfully collecting coal (544 units)\n- Inserter waiting for source items\n- Furnace currently idle with no ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- When placing 2x2 entities like furnaces, ensure the entire 2x2 area is clear of obstacles\n- Check for water tiles or other terrain restrictions before placing structures\n- Consider the exact positioning requirements for connected systems (inserters, belts, etc.)\n\n### Entity Alignment Issues\n- Pay attention to inserter pickup and drop positions when connecting different entities\n- Ensure proper rotation of inserters to maintain correct material flow\n- When rebuilding systems, remove all conflicting entities before placing new ones\n\n### System Design\n- Plan the layout considering the size of all entities (especially 2x2 structures like furnaces)\n- Verify that inserter reach is appropriate for the intended pickup and drop locations\n- Consider using coordinate offsets to ensure precise placement of connected entities\n\nNAMESPACE\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails if location is blocked or invalid.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace: Entity (stone-furnace)\n- mining_drill: Entity (burner-mining-drill)\n- chest: Entity (wooden-chest)\n- inserter: Entity (burner-inserter)\n\nThe logs show multiple attempts at rebuilding and adjusting the same structure, indicating a need for better initial placement planning and coordinate calculation."}
