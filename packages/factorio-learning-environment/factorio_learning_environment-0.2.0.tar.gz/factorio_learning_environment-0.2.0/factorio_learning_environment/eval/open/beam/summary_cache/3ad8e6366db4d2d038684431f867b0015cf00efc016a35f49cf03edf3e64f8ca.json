{"content": "Ah, I see the fundamental issues now. Let me break down what I've learned from these attempts:\n\n1. We need to actually craft stone furnaces - just having stone in our inventory isn't enough\n2. We need to be within 10 units of where we want to place entities\n3. We need to use our actual position rather than defaulting to (0,0)\n\nLet's try a corrected version:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Initial Inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Get stone if needed\nmove_to(nearest(Resource.Stone))\nharvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), quantity=50)\n\n# Stay where we are after collecting stone\nplayer_pos = get_entities()[0].position\nprint(f\"Current position: {player_pos}\")\n\n# Try to craft stone furnaces first\n# Note: Need to verify if there's a craft_item command available\n\n# Place our first furnace near where we are\nfurnace1 = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=player_pos\n)\n\n# Place second furnace next to first\nfurnace2 = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    reference_position=furnace1.position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\n\n# Add fuel and ore\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace1, 25)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace1, 25)\n\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace2, 25)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace2, 25)\n\nprint(f\"Final entities: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nQuestion for clarification: Is there a craft_item or similar command available in the API to create stone furnaces from raw materials? This seems to be the missing piece we need to proceed.\n\nCould you please confirm:\n1. If there's a way to craft items from raw materials\n2. What the complete list of available commands is\n3. Whether stone furnaces need to be crafted or if they should be available in the starting inventory\n\nThis would help me provide a more accurate solution.", "summary_range": "[1-32]"}
