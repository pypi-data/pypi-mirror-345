# Camtty üì∏ -> üíª -> üé®

**Turn your webcam feed into live ASCII art directly in your terminal!**

Camtty is a fun command-line tool that captures video from your webcam, converts each frame into ASCII characters, and displays the result in real-time in your terminal.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Live Webcam Feed:** See the world around you rendered in ASCII.
*   **Real-time Conversion:** Fast conversion process for a smooth experience.
*   **Terminal-Based:** Runs entirely within your terminal using libraries like `blessed`.
*   **Customizable (Future):** (Add potential future features like character set selection, resolution adjustment, etc.)

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.7+
    *   `pip` (Python package installer)
    *   A connected webcam recognized by your system.

2.  **Install using pip:**
    *(Assuming your package is or will be published on PyPI)*
    ```bash
    pip install camtty
    ```
    *Alternatively, for local development:*
    ```bash
    # Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
    # git clone https://github.com/Aresga/Camtty.git
    # cd camtty

## üîß How it Works

Camtty uses:

*   **OpenCV (`opencv-python`)**: To capture video frames from the webcam.
*   **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations on image data.
*   **Blessed**: To control the terminal and display the ASCII art smoothly.

The core logic involves:
1.  Capturing a frame from the webcam.
2.  Resizing the frame (optional, for performance/fit).
3.  Converting the frame to grayscale.
4.  Mapping pixel intensity values to ASCII characters.
5.  Printing the resulting ASCII string to the terminal using `blessed` for positioning.
