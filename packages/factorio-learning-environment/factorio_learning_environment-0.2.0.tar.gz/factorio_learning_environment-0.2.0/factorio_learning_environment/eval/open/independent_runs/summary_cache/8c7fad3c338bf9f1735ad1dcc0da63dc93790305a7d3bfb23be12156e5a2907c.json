{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nThis structure is designed to generate electricity but is currently not operational due to connection issues. It consists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (22.5, -7.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED.\n- **Boiler** at position (20.5, -4.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (19.5, -1.5) with status WORKING.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting these components, including pipes at positions such as (19.5, -2.5) and (20.5, -5.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nThis facility is responsible for smelting copper ore into copper plates. It consists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (2.0, 0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, indicating it requires more copper ore to continue production.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nThis facility is responsible for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, indicating it requires more iron ore to continue production.\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-3.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- **Inserter** at position (-3.5, 1.5) with status NO_POWER, indicating it is not receiving electricity.\n- **Lab** with status NO_POWER, indicating it is not receiving electricity for research.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Attempting to Pick Up Non-Existent Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe you intend to pick up actually exists at the specified location before attempting to pick it up.\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target position for placing a pipe is clear of any existing objects to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Check the connections between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure that water is being delivered to the boiler. Ensure all pipes are correctly connected and that there are no blockages.\n\n### Steam Engine and Boiler Not Connected\n- Ensure that the steam engine and boiler are properly connected through pipes to allow the flow of steam and water. Verify the alignment and connection points of all involved entities.\n\n### Inserter and Lab Not Receiving Power\n- Check the electricity network to ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional power source. Verify that all electric poles are properly placed and connected."}
