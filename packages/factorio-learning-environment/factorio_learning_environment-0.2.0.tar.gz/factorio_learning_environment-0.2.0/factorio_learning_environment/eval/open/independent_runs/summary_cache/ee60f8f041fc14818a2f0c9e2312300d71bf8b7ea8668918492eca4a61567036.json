For example, iron gear wheels are needed for the assembling machine to craft automation science packs.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Check that all machines, especially the assembling machine and lab, are connected to a power source to avoid them being inactive due to lack of electricity."}
