{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n- Transport Belt network connecting various positions, including (x=-24.5, y=-69.5), (x=-21.5, y=-69.5), and (x=-21.5, y=-66.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing produced iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at Position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transferring items from a Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of source items to prevent them from idling. Check the supply chain feeding into the inserters to ensure they are receiving the necessary items.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
