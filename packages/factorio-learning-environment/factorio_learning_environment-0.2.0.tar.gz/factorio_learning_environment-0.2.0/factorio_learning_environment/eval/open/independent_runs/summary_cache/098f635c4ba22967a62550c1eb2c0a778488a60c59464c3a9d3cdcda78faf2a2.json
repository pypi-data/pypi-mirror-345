{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science packs inserted\n- Connected to the power supply\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=3708) at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=3711, fluid=water) at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=3716, fluid=steam) at position (x=-1.5, y=22.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=1837) with poles at positions (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5)\n\n### Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace with coal fuel and iron-plate production\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Setting Research\n- Ensure that the research prerequisites are met before attempting to set research. Verify that the lab has the necessary science packs and that the research is available.\n\n### Errors with Lab Not Working on Research\n- Confirm that the lab is properly connected to the power supply and has the required science packs for the research being attempted.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Regularly check the coal inventory to ensure there is enough fuel for the boiler. Harvest coal as needed to maintain a sufficient supply.\n\n### Errors with Entity Connections\n- Ensure all entities, such as the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, are correctly connected to maintain functionality. Reconnect any disconnected entities promptly."}
