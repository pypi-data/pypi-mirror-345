{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts were made to create a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to research; however, none succeeded because of inventory shortages and crafting issues. In addition, the agent interacted with pre\u2010existing furnace structures to support smelting operations:\n\u2022 Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) \u2013 used to convert iron ore and coal into iron plates.\n\u2022 Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) \u2013 used to convert copper ore and coal into copper plates.\n(Note: These furnaces were retrieved from the map rather than built by the agent.)\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Usage Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities(), use only supported parameters. Remove unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or excess positional parameters to match the API signature.\n\u2022 Lab Placement Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that a lab is present in the inventory before attempting to place it at a target position.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the intended placement tile is free and accessible.\n\u2022 Iteration Safety:\n\u2003\u2013 Check that objects returned from API calls (e.g. the list of existing labs) are not None before iterating.\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Shortages:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are available in sufficient quantities before attempting to craft a lab.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that the entire crafting chain (including prerequisite smelting or assembly processes) is functional.\n\u2022 Fallback Strategies:\n\u2003\u2013 When using fallback approaches, default to safe values (such as an empty list) to prevent type errors due to unexpected None values."}
