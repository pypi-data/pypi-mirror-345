{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) storing extracted coal\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the chest to a transport belt\n- Transport Belt starting from position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) moving coal to other locations\n- Secondary Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing additional coal\n- Additional Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for moving coal between entities\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) currently inactive due to lack of ingredients\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extending transport belts\n- Ensure that the path for extending transport belts is clear and valid. Verify that there are no obstacles or invalid paths that could prevent the belt from being extended.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory. This will prevent insertion failures due to lack of items.\n\n### Errors in smelting process\n- Verify that all necessary ingredients are available in the furnace before starting the smelting process. Ensure that the furnace is properly fueled and contains the required raw materials to avoid assertion errors related to the smelting process not starting.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that items are being produced or transported to the inserters' pickup positions."}
