{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Original Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (0, 0)) with an inventory containing iron-plate.\n\n### New Furnace at position(2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (2, 0)) with an inventory containing copper-plate.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Chest (position (3.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing copper-plate.\n\n### Copper Plate Factory at position(2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- New Furnace (position (2, 0)) with an inventory containing copper-plate.\n- Assembling machine (position(z1)) and inserter (position(a)) that puts into assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position (2, 0) to assembling machine at position(z1).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting Automation Science Packs\n- Ensure you have enough required sub-ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft Automation Science Packs. Specifically, make sure you have enough iron-plates and copper-plates, as they are essential for crafting iron-gear-wheels and automation science packs.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. For example, if you attempt to insert Copper Ore into the New Furnace, make sure you have Copper Ore available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when crafting Iron Gear Wheels\n- Ensure you have enough iron-plates available in your inventory before attempting to craft Iron Gear Wheels, as they are essential for this recipe.\n\n### Errors when crafting with insufficient copper-plate\n- Ensure you have enough copper-plates in your inventory before attempting to craft items that require copper-plate as a sub-ingredient.\n\n### Errors when extracting from Wooden Chest\n- Ensure that the Wooden Chest contains the item you are trying to extract. For example, you cannot extract iron-ore from a Wooden Chest if it does not contain any iron-ore.\n\n### Errors when crafting Iron Gear Wheels due to insufficient iron-plate\n- Ensure you have enough iron-plates available in your inventory before attempting to craft Iron Gear Wheels, as the recipe requires 2 iron-plates."}
