Numerous repositioning attempts have been executed without success.\n- Boiler at position(-6.0, 24.5) now showing status NO_FUEL with warning [\"out of fuel\"]; it contains a water-filled fluid box, is assigned to fluid_system [54726], and outputs steam at position(-7.5, 24.5).\n- Offshore Pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) operating in WORKING status and associated with fluid_system [54726].\n- Pipeline Network: Encompasses multiple repositioning attempts targeting candidate pipe groups with fluid_system identifiers 54153, 54235, 54319, 54401, 54485, 54567, and 54651 within radii ranging from 5 to 15 tiles\u2014all of which failed to yield a valid connection.\n- Manual Fuel Feeding System: Wooden chest at position(-4.5, 25.5) designated for fuel storage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Pipeline Connection & Fluid Transfer:\n  - Verify that both source and target connection points are unobstructed, within range, and compatible for fluid transfer.\n  - For segmented pipeline setups, ensure intermediate connections are clear and that the correct fluid type is present.\n  - If direct connections fail, recheck alignment and environmental clearance at both connection points.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement & Collision Avoidance:\n  - Confirm that the target tile is free of obstructions before repositioning large entities such as the steam engine.\n\n\u2022 Buildable Area Calculation:\n  - Use the correct placement attributes (for example, accessing a property rather than calling a non-callable object) to avoid type errors during position determination.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Group Identification:\n  - Ensure a nearby pipe group carrying the required fluid exists before attempting to attach an entity to the network.\n\n\u2022 General Connection Strategies:\n  - Reassess connection methods if initial attempts (direct or segmented) fail, taking environmental obstacles and inventory constraints into account.\n\n\u2022 Repositioning via Candidate Pipe Groups:\n  - Multiple repositioning attempts have failed due to no candidate pipe groups being found with fluid_system identifiers (54153, 54235, 54319, 54401, 54485, 54567, 54651). Validate fluid_system assignments and adjust search radii or reference positions accordingly.\n\n\u2022 Boiler Fuel Supply Management:\n  - The boiler now reports a NO_FUEL status with an \u201cout of fuel\u201d warning. Monitor its fuel inventory closely and replenish fuel before operation to avoid downtime."}
