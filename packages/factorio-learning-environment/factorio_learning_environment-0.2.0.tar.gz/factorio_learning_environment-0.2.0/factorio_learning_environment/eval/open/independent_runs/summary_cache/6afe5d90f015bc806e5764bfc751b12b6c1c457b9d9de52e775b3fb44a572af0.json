{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n\nThis facility is designed to extract iron ore and smelt it into iron plates. The mining drill extracts iron ore, which is then fed into the stone furnace for smelting. The furnace currently has no ingredients to smelt, indicating a potential blockage or misalignment in the resource flow.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest at the new location**: Ensure that the target location for placing a wooden chest is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n- **Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location**: Verify that the intended location for the burner inserter is free and correctly aligned with other entities for proper functionality.\n- **Cannot place Transport Belt at the desired location**: Check that the transport belt's desired location is clear and that it connects correctly with other belts or entities.\n\n### Errors related to entity retrieval\n- **Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at specified position**: Ensure that the stone furnace exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve or interact with it. Double-check the coordinates for accuracy.\n\n### Errors related to entity movement\n- **Cannot move the Stone Furnace to the new location**: Confirm that the destination for moving the stone furnace is valid and unoccupied by other entities.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage\n- **Output blocked by item on the ground**: Ensure that there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or another conveyor belt) to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- **No ingredients to smelt in the furnace**: Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to process and smelt into iron plates. Check the supply chain for any disruptions."}
