{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has once again not met expectations, resulting in the following observations:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now holds **3 pieces of stone** and remains in a **\"WORKING\"** state.\n- However, it still does not show any processing of the Copper Ore, indicating that it has not recognized the necessary inputs for smelting.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore available**.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates available**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is still not processing any materials, and the input of stone is insufficient to meet the recipe requirements for smelting Copper Ore.\n- The furnace continues to indicate that it has not begun any production activity.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract the Remaining Stone**: I will need to extract the **3 pieces of stone** from the furnace to reset its current contents once again.\n2. **Load the Required Stone**: After clearing the furnace, I will ensure that I have **5 pieces of stone** ready to load.\n3. **Insert Copper Ore for Smelting**: Finally, I will add the **1 piece of Copper Ore** to engage the smelting operation.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the remaining stone from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the remaining stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Extract the 3 pieces of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-348]"}
