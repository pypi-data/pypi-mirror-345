{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer Station at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns correctly with the source entity (e.g., chest) and the drop position aligns with the target entity (e.g., furnace). Misalignment will prevent the inserter from functioning properly.\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- Before placing an inserter, verify that the intended position is not occupied by another entity and that the placement direction is feasible. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary to avoid collisions.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Keep a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Resource Transfer Errors\n- If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, inspect the inserter setup for misalignments or blockages. Ensure the inserter is correctly positioned and fueled to facilitate the transfer of resources."}
