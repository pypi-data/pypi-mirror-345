# Description
short_description: "tLedger Plugin for Game SDK. TLedger is a blockchain-agnostic agent account management platform"
detailed_description: "tLedger is t54’s foundational product—a blockchain-agnostic account & ledger designed to support AI agent-initiated financial transactions. It enables developers to create and manage agent-level virtual accounts, set programmable spending limits, and trigger on-chain payments via a lightweight SDK. Each agent is provisioned with multi-asset wallets (e.g., USDT, SOL), and all activity is surfaced through robust APIs and a web-based portal. The platform enforces compliance through Know Your Agent (KYA) protocols and centralized risk controls, giving developers the tooling to deploy financially autonomous agents at scale."
