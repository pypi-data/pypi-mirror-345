{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) and steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel, and the steam engine is not connected to a power network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine at position -21.5, 25.5.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5) and connected pipes.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is currently not conducting any research.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, including:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 39376) at position (-12.5, 21.5) connected to the offshore pump.\n- Additional pipe groups at various positions facilitating fluid transport.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel availability\n- Ensure to keep coal or other fuel sources in inventory to refuel the boiler. Regularly check inventory before starting operations that require fuel.\n\n### Errors when placing small-electric-pole\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place the small-electric-pole. The maximum distance for placement is 10 tiles.\n- Check for existing objects in the way before placing a small-electric-pole. If the target position is occupied, find a suitable alternative location.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Always verify the surroundings to avoid obstruction issues."}
