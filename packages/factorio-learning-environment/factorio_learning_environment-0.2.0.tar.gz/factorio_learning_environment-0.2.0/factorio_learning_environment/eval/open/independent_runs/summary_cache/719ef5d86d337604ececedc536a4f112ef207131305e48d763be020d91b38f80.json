The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required ingredients\n- Gather the necessary raw resources before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is required to craft a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without unlocking the recipe\n- Research the necessary technology before attempting to craft items that require specific recipes. For example, steel-processing technology must be researched to craft a steel chest.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Make sure to be within the correct range to extract items from entities. If the entity is too far away, the extraction will fail."}
