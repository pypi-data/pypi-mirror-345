{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) used for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) used for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) used for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) which extracts coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) that transfers coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly extract items from the furnace to prevent it from becoming full and halting production. Consider using an inserter to automate the extraction process.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of the furnace.\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the player's current inventory.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map."}
