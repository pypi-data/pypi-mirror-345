{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, facilitating steam and water flow\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and another at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for producing copper cables\n- Inserter at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5) for feeding materials into the Assembling Machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) to the Assembling Machine\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chests at various positions for storing resources\n- Inserters at Positions (x=-3.5, y=1.5) and (x=9.5, y=5.5) for transferring items between chests and belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Assembling Machine Not Receiving Copper Plates\n- Ensure that the transport system is correctly configured to deliver copper plates to the assembling machine. Check the belt connections and inserter placements.\n\n### Failed to Connect Transport Belt\n- Verify that the path for the transport belt is clear and that the start and end positions are correctly aligned. Ensure there are no obstructions or incorrect placements between the entities you are trying to connect.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that the source items are available and that the inserter is correctly positioned to pick up items. Adjust the inserter's pickup and drop positions as necessary."}
