{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore.\n\n### Coal Mining and Fueling Station at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) for transferring coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) for transferring coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters without source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to transfer. Check that the mining drills or other source entities are producing or have items to be moved.\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Regularly check fuel levels in burner entities such as mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Refuel them before they run out to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing structures."}
