{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Production Line\nA complex iron plate production line consisting of:\n\nInput Section:\n- 4 wooden chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) containing coal and iron ore\n- 4 burner inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving materials from input chests to furnaces\n\nProcessing Section:\n- 4 stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into plates\n\nOutput Section:\n- Output wooden chest at (-2.5, 0.5) with burner inserter at (-1.5, 0.5) collecting from first furnace\n- 3 wooden chests at (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5) collecting processed iron plates\n- 4 burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 1.5), (3.5, 1.5), and (5.5, 1.5) moving plates between output chests\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to pick up non-existent items\n- Verify the existence of items at target position before attempting pickup\n- Example: Could not pickup iron-ore at position (0.5, -0.5)\n\n### Inserter placement optimization needed\n- Some inserters show \"waiting for space in destination\" warnings\n- Ensure proper spacing and chest placement for inserter output\n- Configure proper rotation of inserters to face their target destinations\n\n### Output flow issues\n- Multiple inserters showing \"waiting for source items\" status\n- Ensure consistent material flow through the production line\n- Check that input materials are adequately supplied to keep production flowing\n\n### Space management\n- Some inserters report being blocked by items on ground\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to prevent blockages\n- Add appropriate sink entities where needed for item collection"}
