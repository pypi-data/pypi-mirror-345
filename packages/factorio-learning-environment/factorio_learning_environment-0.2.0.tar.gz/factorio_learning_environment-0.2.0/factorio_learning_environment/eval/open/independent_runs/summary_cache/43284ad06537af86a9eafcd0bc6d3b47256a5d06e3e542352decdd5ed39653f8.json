{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three connected burner mining drills in a row:\n- Drill 1 at (-10, -59) outputting to chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Drill 2 at (-8, -59) outputting to chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Drill 3 at (-6, -59) outputting to chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are operational and mining iron ore.\n\n### Copper Processing Setup at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59) for smelting\n- Burner inserter at (-28.5, -58.5) feeding the furnace\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving processed plates\n- Storage chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nFour parallel smelting columns:\n1. Column 1:\n   - Furnace at (0, 0)\n   - Input chest at (0.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (0.5, 2.5)\n   - Inserters at (0.5, -1.5) and (0.5, 1.5)\n\n2. Column 2:\n   - Furnace at (2, 0)\n   - Input chest at (2.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (2.5, 2.5)\n   - Inserters at (2.5, -1.5) and (2.5, 1.5)\n\n3. Column 3:\n   - Furnace at (4, 0)\n   - Input chest at (4.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (4.5, 2.5)\n   - Inserters at (4.5, -1.5) and (4.5, 1.5)\n\n4. Column 4:\n   - Furnace at (6, 0)\n   - Input chest at (6.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (6.5, 2.5)\n   - Inserters at (6.5, -1.5) and (6.5, 1.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in inventory before attempting to refuel entities\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items into entities\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning - ensure proper input material flow\n- Some inserters showing \"waiting for source items\" - verify input supply chain is working correctly\n- One furnace showing \"out of fuel\" - implement regular refueling routine\n\n### Output Blocking Issues\n- Mining drill output is blocked by items on ground - ensure proper output collection system (chest or belt) is in place before starting operation"}
