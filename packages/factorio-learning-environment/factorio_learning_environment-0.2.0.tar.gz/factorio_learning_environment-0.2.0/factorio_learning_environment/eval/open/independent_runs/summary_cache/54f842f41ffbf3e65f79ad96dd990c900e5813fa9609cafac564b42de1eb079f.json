{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (1.5, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (17.5, 20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (1.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and Steam Engine\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=17603) at Position (3.5, 17.5) with pipes extending to (10.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=17614) at Position (-9.5, 23.5) with pipes extending to (-0.5, 23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=32957) with poles at positions such as (21.5, 27.5), (27.5, 26.5), (26.5, 17.5), (33.5, 24.5), (35.5, 24.5), and (1.5, 2.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure there is a suitable and unoccupied position for placing small electric poles. Check the surrounding area for any obstructions or existing entities that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of steam. Check the pipe connections and ensure that the fluid system is complete and operational.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Fueling\n- Ensure that the boiler is consistently fueled to maintain operation. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary to avoid the \"out of fuel\" status.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- Utility Functions:\n  - None defined in the provided logs.\n\n- Important Variables:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'burner-inserter', 'small-electric-pole', etc.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map, though specific data is omitted in the logs."}
