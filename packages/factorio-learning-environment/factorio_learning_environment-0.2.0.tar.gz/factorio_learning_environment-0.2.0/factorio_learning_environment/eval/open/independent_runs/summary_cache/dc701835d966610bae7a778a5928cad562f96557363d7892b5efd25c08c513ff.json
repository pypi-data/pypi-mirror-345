(Step 1: `NameError: name 'entity' is not defined`)\n* Errors when using incorrect operand types:\n  - Check the operand types before performing operations. (Step 4: `TypeError: bad operand type for unary -: 'type'`)\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid positions:\n  - Ensure the target location is valid and not occupied before placing entities. (Step 5: `Exception: Could not place steam-engine at (-5.5, -0.5), Cannot place steam-engine at the target location - something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable (water)`)\n  - Check the entity placement rules and terrain restrictions. (Step 6: `Cannot place steam engine at the target location`)\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
