{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures successfully established on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Burner Inserters, but these attempts have not resulted in any functional structures due to placement errors and other issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you intend to place. This includes checking for sufficient space and compatibility with the terrain.\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables in code\n- Verify that all variables are properly defined before use. For instance, ensure that the variable `furnace` is correctly initialized before attempting to access its properties or methods.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from the map\n- Confirm that entities exist at the specified positions before attempting to interact with them. Use functions like `get_entity` only after verifying the presence of the entity at the desired location.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at incorrect positions\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the entities are being placed within the valid buildable area. Adjust the positions as necessary to fit within the map's constraints.\n\n### Errors with setup not producing expected outputs\n- Review the setup and connections between entities to ensure they are correctly configured to produce the desired outputs, such as iron plates. Check for missing or incorrectly placed components that could disrupt the production process.\n\n### Errors with incorrect API usage\n- Familiarize yourself with the API documentation to ensure correct usage of functions and methods, especially when dealing with entity placement and retrieval.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- Confirm that the destination is valid and that the entity can be moved to the desired location. Ensure there are no obstructions or invalid terrain types that could prevent the move."}
