{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) which is extracting iron ore and depositing it into a chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, -58.5), (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (9.5, -60.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. These furnaces are intermittently supplied with iron ore and coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) for additional storage of iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates a lack of coal in the inventory when trying to insert into a drill.\n\n### Errors related to full storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. The warning \"chest at drop position is full\" indicates that the mining drill cannot continue extracting resources until the chest is emptied.\n\n### Errors related to furnace operations\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with sufficient ingredients to maintain continuous operation. The warning \"no ingredients to smelt\" indicates that the furnace is idle due to a lack of input materials.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int)`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the inventory has the required quantity before calling this function.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `drill`: Represents a mining drill entity, type `Entity`.\n  - `coal_to_insert`: Represents the quantity of coal intended for insertion, type `int`.\n  - `inventory`: Represents the player's current inventory, type `dict` with keys as item names and values as quantities."}
