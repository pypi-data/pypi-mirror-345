{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 2.0)\n- Wooden chest (position 5.5, 0.5)\n\n### Lab at position(10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position 10.5, 10.5)\n- Connected to multiple small electric poles for power supply.\n\n### Small electric pole group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 11.5, 13.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 10.5, 13.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 9.5, 13.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 14.5, 9.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 12.807692307692308, 10.807692307692308)\n- Small electric pole (position 12.928571428571429, 10.714285714285714)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place small electric poles\n- Ensure you have small electric poles in your inventory before attempting to place them. An error occurred when trying to place a small electric pole without having any in inventory.\n\n### Errors when connecting lab to electric poles\n- Check the status of the electric poles before connecting them to the lab. If the poles are not plugged into an electric network, the lab will remain without power.\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of electricity groups\n- Avoid accessing attributes that do not exist for certain objects. An error occurred when trying to access the 'energy' attribute of an 'ElectricityGroup' object, which does not have this attribute.\n\n### General inventory management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for building and connecting structures."}
