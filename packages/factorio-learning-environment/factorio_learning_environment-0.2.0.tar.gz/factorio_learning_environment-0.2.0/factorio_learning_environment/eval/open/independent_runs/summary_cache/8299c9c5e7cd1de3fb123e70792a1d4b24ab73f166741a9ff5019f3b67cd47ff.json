{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at various positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-3.5, 24.5), and (5.5, 24.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions (1.5, 10.5), (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 14.5), (1.5, 2.5), and (1.5, 6.5)\n\n### Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\n- Lab connected to power network, currently missing science packs for research.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For instance, the variable 'Lab' must be defined or imported before being referenced.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure you have the required pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect them.\n- Verify the connection path between entities like offshore pumps and boilers to ensure they are correctly aligned and connected.\n\n### Errors with Crafting Items\n- Ensure all sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft complex items like automation science packs. For example, iron plates are needed to craft iron gear wheels, which are a sub-ingredient for automation science packs.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Resources\n- Regularly check and maintain sufficient resources like coal for refueling boilers and furnaces to prevent interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors with Missing Science Packs\n- Ensure that labs have the necessary science packs to continue research. Craft or acquire more packs if needed.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Ensure all structures needing power are connected to the power network to function properly."}
