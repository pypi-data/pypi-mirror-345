{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) with coal as fuel. It is currently in status: WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION due to output blockage.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with coal as fuel, currently working on converting iron ore to iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) with coal as fuel, responsible for moving items between entities. It is currently in status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS due to a full chest.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the mining drill and inserter, consisting of 7 belts, facilitating the movement of items between entities.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- **Transport Belts** verified at positions (x=43.5, y=-82.5) and (x=43.5, y=-80.5), ensuring correct alignment for efficient item transportation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place entities such as Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters. This will prevent placement errors like those encountered at positions (x=45.0, y=-79.5), (x=44.5, y=-79.5), and similar locations.\n\n### Errors due to output blockage\n- Address the issue of output blockage for the Burner Mining Drill by ensuring there is a sink entity or storage available to accept the output. This will resolve the status: WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly check and clear the inventory of entities like the Burner Inserter to prevent status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS. Ensure there is adequate space in connected chests or storage units to accommodate incoming items."}
