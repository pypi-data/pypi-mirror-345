{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Factory at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace (position 2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace (position 4.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace (position 6.0, 0.0)\n- Chest (position 8.5, 0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to missing coal in furnaces\n- Ensure to have enough coal in inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnaces. Check your inventory regularly to avoid running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors when furnaces are missing ingredients\n- Make sure to supply the necessary ingredients (iron ore in this case) to the furnaces to enable them to smelt properly.\n\n### Errors when trying to smelt without fuel\n- Always check that your furnaces have sufficient fuel before starting the smelting process. If a furnace runs out of fuel, it will not be able to process any materials.\n\n### Errors related to furnaces being out of fuel\n- Regularly monitor the fuel levels in your furnaces and ensure they are adequately supplied with coal to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when furnaces report missing coal but have iron ore\n- Check your inventory and ensure you have enough coal to supply all furnaces. If multiple furnaces are reporting the same issue, prioritize supplying coal to them to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors when there is not enough coal left in inventory\n- Ensure to gather sufficient coal before attempting to insert it into the furnaces. Consider setting up a dedicated coal mining operation to maintain a steady supply."}
