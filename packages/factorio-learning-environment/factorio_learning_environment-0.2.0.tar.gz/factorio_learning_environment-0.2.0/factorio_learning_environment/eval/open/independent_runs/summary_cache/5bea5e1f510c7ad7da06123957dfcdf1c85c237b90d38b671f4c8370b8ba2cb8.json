{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is currently fueled by coal and is in working status.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) which transfers iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest. It is fueled by coal and is in working status.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) used for storing iron plates. It currently holds 16 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=4.5, y=0.5) intended to transfer items from a transport belt to a chest. It is fueled by coal and is waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied\n- Ensure there is enough space and no existing entities at the target location before placing a new entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory\n- Before attempting to place or use an entity, verify that the required item is available in the inventory. Craft or acquire the necessary items beforehand.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities inappropriately\n- When connecting entities like belts and chests, ensure that the connection is valid. Use inserters to transfer items into chests instead of connecting belts directly to them.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Ensure all necessary sub-ingredients are available for crafting. For items like transport belts, ensure you have enough iron plates, which may require smelting in a furnace or using a crafting machine."}
