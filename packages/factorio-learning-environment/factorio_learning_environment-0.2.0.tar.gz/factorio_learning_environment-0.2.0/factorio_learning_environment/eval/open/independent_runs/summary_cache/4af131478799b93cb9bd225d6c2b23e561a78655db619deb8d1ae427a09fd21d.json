{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine and Smelter at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities\n- Burner Mining Drill (position: 16.0, 71.0)\n- Wooden Chest (position: 16.5, 72.5)\n- Stone Furnace (position: 18.0, 73.0)\n- Burner Inserter (position: 16.5, 73.5) that moves iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- Burner Inserter (position: 18.5, 74.5) that fuels the furnace with coal\n- Wooden Chest (position: 14.5, 72.5) that stores iron ore\n- Wooden Chest (position: 18.5, 75.5) that stores coal\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities too far away or with incorrect spacing\n  - Make sure to move to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is not explicitly stated but is a limitation. Check for existing entities that might be blocking the placement and adjust the spacing or direction accordingly.\n* Errors when inserting items into an entity\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure all variables are defined before using them in your code. Check for typos and ensure that the variable is within the scope of the current execution context.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at an occupied position\n  - Ensure the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. Check the position and surrounding area for existing entities.\n* Errors when connecting entities directly without using an inserter\n  - Use an inserter to transfer items between entities like chests and furnaces instead of trying to connect them directly with transport belts.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity next to another entity with insufficient spacing\n  - Adjust the spacing or direction when placing entities next to each other to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions were found in the provided execution logs.\n\nImportant variables that have been assigned:\n- `drill`: Burner Mining Drill entity \n- `chest`: Wooden Chest entity \n- `furnace`: Stone Furnace entity \n- `coal_inserter`: Burner Inserter entity that fuels the furnace with coal \n- `iron_ore_inserter`: Burner Inserter entity that moves iron ore from the chest to the furnace \n\nNew variables:\nNone \n\nThe report has been updated to reflect the changes in the existing structures and new error tips. The iron ore mine and smelter structure has been updated to include the new Burner Inserter and Wooden Chest entities. The error tips section has been updated with new tips regarding connecting entities directly without using an inserter and attempting to place an entity next to another entity with insufficient spacing."}
