{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure the player is within the maximum allowable distance (10 units) from the target position when placing entities. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter setup issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly set up to facilitate the intended transfer of resources.\n\n### Fuel management\n- Regularly refuel entities such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish them as needed to prevent interruptions in production.\n\n### Resource flow management\n- Ensure that chests and other storage entities do not become full, as this can halt production. Regularly check and clear out excess resources to maintain a smooth flow of materials."}
