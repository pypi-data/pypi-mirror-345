{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis facility extracts iron ore, stores it in a chest, and smelts it into iron plates using a stone furnace. The burner inserter moves iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Iron Smelting Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis facility extracts coal, stores it in a chest, and uses it to fuel the stone furnace for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The burner inserter moves items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, make sure you have enough iron ore before inserting it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors When Chests Are Full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping. For instance, empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors When Furnaces Have No Ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with the required raw materials to avoid downtime."}
