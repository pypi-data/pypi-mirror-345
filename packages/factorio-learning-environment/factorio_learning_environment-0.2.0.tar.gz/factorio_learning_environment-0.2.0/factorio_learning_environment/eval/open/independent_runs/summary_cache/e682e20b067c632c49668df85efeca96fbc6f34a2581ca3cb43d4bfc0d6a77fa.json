{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Transport System at (-82.0, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing right\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) moving items from belt to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (46.0, -80.0) facing up\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities when placing them:\n  - Multiple attempts failed due to entities overlapping or being too close\n  - Keep minimum required spacing between furnaces, belts, and inserters\n- Check terrain compatibility before placing entities:\n  - Attempts to place furnace failed due to water or unplaceable terrain\n  - Scout the area first to ensure suitable building locations\n- Entity placement order matters:\n  - Place larger entities (like furnaces) first before placing inserters and belts\n  - This prevents placement conflicts and overlap issues\n- Consider entity rotation and direction:\n  - Ensure furnaces and other directional entities are properly oriented\n  - Incorrect orientation can prevent proper item flow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  - Success: When placement location is clear and terrain is suitable\n  - Failure: When location is blocked or terrain is unsuitable\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Mining drill status: EntityStatus (WORKING/NO_FUEL)\n- Chest inventory: Dictionary of items and counts\n- Inserter status: EntityStatus (WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION)\n- Furnace status: EntityStatus (NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Entity positions: Position(x, y) objects for placement coordinates"}
