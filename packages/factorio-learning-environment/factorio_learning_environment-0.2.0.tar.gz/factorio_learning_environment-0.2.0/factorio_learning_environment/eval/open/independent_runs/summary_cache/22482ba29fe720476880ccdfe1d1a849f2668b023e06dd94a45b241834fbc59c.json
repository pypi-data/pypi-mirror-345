{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1** at position (-14.0, -49.0) and **Furnace 2** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), and (-14.5, -43.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-11.5, -44.5) for additional storage of iron plates.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting various entities for transporting iron plates and other items.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-3.5, 23.5) for generating electricity.\n- **Boiler** at position (-7.0, 23.5) for heating water.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) for supplying water to the boiler.\n- **Pipe Group** for transporting water, consisting of pipes at positions (-8.5, 21.5), (-8.5, 22.5), (-8.5, 23.5), and (-9.5, 23.5).\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at various positions for distributing electricity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Ensure that there is a clear path for inserters to move items. Avoid placing items on the ground that can block the inserter's operation.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that there is a steady supply of source items for inserters. Ensure that the source entities (e.g., furnaces or chests) are producing or holding items that the inserters can pick up.\n\n### Low Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly monitor fuel levels in boilers and furnaces. Gather more coal or other fuel sources to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Destination Chest Full\n- Monitor the inventory levels of destination chests. Consider expanding storage capacity or processing items faster to prevent overflow."}
