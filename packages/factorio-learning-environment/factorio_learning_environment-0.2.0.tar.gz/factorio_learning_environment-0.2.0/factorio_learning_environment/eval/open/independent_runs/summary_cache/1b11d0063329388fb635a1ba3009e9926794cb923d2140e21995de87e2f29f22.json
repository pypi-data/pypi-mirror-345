{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Factory at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (4.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (6.0, 0.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to missing coal for smelting\n- Ensure to keep a sufficient supply of coal in inventory to insert into the furnaces. Check inventory levels before attempting to smelt iron ore.\n\n### Errors when the furnace is out of fuel\n- Monitor the fuel levels in the furnaces regularly. If a furnace is out of fuel, it will not be able to smelt any items. Consider setting up a more automated fuel supply system.\n\n### Errors when trying to smelt without ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces have both coal and iron ore available before attempting to smelt. If either ingredient is missing, the smelting process cannot occur."}
