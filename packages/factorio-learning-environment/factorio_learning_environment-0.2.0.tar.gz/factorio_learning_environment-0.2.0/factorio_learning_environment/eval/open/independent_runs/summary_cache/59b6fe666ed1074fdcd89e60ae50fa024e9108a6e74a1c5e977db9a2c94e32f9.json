This indicates that the variable `x` is being used before it has been assigned a value within the scope of that function. Review the logic of `extract_item` to ensure that `x` is always assigned a value before being used.\n\n### Incorrect arguments to `extract_item`\n- The error `Exception: Could not extract.` occurs when the second argument to `extract_item` is the position of the drill. The second argument should be the inventory to extract from.\n\nNAMESPACE\n```"}
