In this structure, 10 units of iron ore and 10 units of coal were inserted and after a smelting cycle 30 iron plates were extracted to boost the overall iron plate count.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at position(-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace entity used for producing copper plates. Here, 50 units of copper ore and 10 units of coal were inserted and 45 copper plates were extracted following the smelting process.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage: When calling get_entities, use the correct signature. Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (such as \"radius\") and do not supply positional arguments unless allowed.\n\n\u2022 Entity Validation: Check that any returned collection (e.g. from get_entities) is not None before iterating over it to prevent TypeError from attempting to iterate a null value.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting: Before attempting to place a Lab, verify that a lab item is available in the inventory. When crafting a Lab, ensure that all sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are sufficiently produced. Inadequate production of intermediary components leads to lab crafting failures.\n\n\u2022 Resource Chain Dependencies: Confirm that primary resources (like iron plates and copper plates) and their downstream products are available in enough quantity before initiating lab crafting, thereby avoiding missing-ingredient errors."}
