{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these components\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserters at Positions (x=13.5, y=0.5), (x=7.5, y=5.5), and (x=9.5, y=5.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) to the assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=17.5, y=-16.5) for water transport\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) for steam transport\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=10.5, y=2.5), (x=0.5, y=4.5), and (x=6.5, y=5.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all inserters are connected to a power source. Check the status of inserters at positions like (x=-3.5, y=1.5) and (x=3.5, y=0.5) to ensure they are powered.\n\n### Inserter Output Blockage\n- Make sure there is a destination for the inserter's output. Inserters at positions (x=3.5, y=0.5) and (x=2.5, y=1.5) are waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Pipe Connection Errors\n- When connecting pipes, ensure that the start and end positions are correct and that there are no obstructions. The error in connecting the pipe from (x=4.5, y=-9.5) to (x=20.5, y=-4.0) indicates a possible misalignment or obstruction.\n\n### Assembling Machine Resource Shortage\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has the necessary resources. The machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5) is missing copper plates to produce copper cables."}
