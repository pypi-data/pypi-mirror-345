These furnaces are integrated within a network designed to process raw ore into plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A burner\u2011mining drill located at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) that extracts iron\u2010ore.\n\u2022 A wooden chest at (\u201313.5, \u201351.5) which serves as the collection point.\n\u2022 An interlink of transport belts that shuttle ore from the drill to the chest.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A boiler situated at (8.0, 20.5) equipped with connection points at approximately (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5) for fluid and steam output.\n\u2022 A network of steam engines deployed across the map at positions:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (0.5, 9.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (18.5, 11.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (1.5, 13.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (13.5, 14.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (19.5, 14.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (22.5, 18.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (17.5, 20.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (12.5, 21.5)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 (4.5, 23.5)\n\u2022 An additional steam engine was intended for this network but remains unplaceable due to spatial congestion.\n\n### Automation Research Lab\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A laboratory unit configured to process automation science packs. Multiple diagnostic snapshots (noted under different electrical IDs such as 6403, 6429, 6455, 6481, 6507, 6533, and 6559) indicate its continual presence in an unpowered state.\n\n### Electrical and Transport Infrastructure\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Distributed Electricity Groups (power poles and connection nodes) that interconnect the base\u2019s power network.\n\u2022 Multiple Belt Groups and Pipe Groups laying out the transport and fluid distribution pathways across the facility, ensuring material flow and resource connectivity.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Issue: The extra steam engine consistently fails to be placed because severe congestion around the boiler (located at (8.0, 20.5)) causes overlapping and misaligned burner\u2011inserters, transport belts, and other adjacent entities. This in turn obstructs the buildable area near approximately (8.5, 22.5).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Recommendation: Manual intervention is required. Inspect the boiler area and all surrounding connection interfaces thoroughly. Remove, reposition, or adjust the interfering entities to clear sufficient space. Alternatively, consider relocating the extra steam engine to a dedicated area with ample room or modifying the boiler layout to ensure proper spacing for engine placement."}
