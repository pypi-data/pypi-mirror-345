{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (-28.0, -61.0)\n- **Coal chest** at position (-28.5, -62.5) containing 20 coal\n- **Chest** at position (-27.5, -59.5) for mining output\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting or transferring coal\n- Ensure the agent has coal in its inventory before attempting to extract or transfer coal.\n- Verify that the target chest or entity is accessible and not full before transferring items.\n\n#### Errors when inserting coal into the mining drill\n- Ensure the mining drill is within range and accessible before attempting to insert coal.\n- Make sure the agent has coal in its inventory before attempting to insert it into the mining drill.\n\n#### Issues with mining drill operation\n- The mining drill is out of fuel and the output chest is full, preventing further operation. Empty the chest at (-27.5, -59.5) to allow the mining drill to continue functioning.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **extract_coal()**: Attempts to extract coal from a chest. Fails if no coal is available or if the chest is inaccessible.\n- **insert_coal()**: Attempts to insert coal into a mining drill. Fails if no coal is in the agent's inventory or if the drill is inaccessible.\n- **transfer_coal()**: Attempts to transfer coal between chests. Fails if the source chest is empty or the target chest is full.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **coal_chest**: Position (-28.5, -62.5), contains 20 coal.\n- **output_chest**: Position (-27.5, -59.5), currently empty.\n- **mining_drill**: Position (-28.0, -61.0), status: EntityStatus.NO_FUEL."}
