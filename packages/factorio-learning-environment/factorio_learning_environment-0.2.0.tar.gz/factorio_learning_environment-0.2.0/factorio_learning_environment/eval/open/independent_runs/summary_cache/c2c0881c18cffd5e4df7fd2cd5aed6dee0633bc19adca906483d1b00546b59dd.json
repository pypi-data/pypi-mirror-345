{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. It currently lacks fuel for the boiler and the steam engine is not connected to the boiler output or the power network.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Offshore Pump at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n*   PipeGroup connecting pump to boiler (positions include x=-8.5,y=-0.5 to x=-4.5,y=0.5)\n*   Boiler at Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5) (Status: NO_FUEL)\n*   PipeGroup intended for steam output (positions include x=-6.5,y=2.5 to x=-2.5,y=6.5) (Status: EMPTY)\n*   Steam Engine at Position(x=0.5, y=6.5) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED, NO_INPUT_LIQUID)\n*   Small Electric Pole at Position(x=0.5, y=4.5) (Part of a larger disconnected pole group)\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Setup (Incomplete) at Position(x=22.5, y=8.5) to (x=26.5, y=19.5)\nThis structure is intended to mine coal, smelt it into iron plates (incorrectly configured), transport plates via belts, and assemble iron gear wheels. It is currently non-functional due to missing power connections, incorrect furnace inputs/outputs (furnaces are empty and lack fuel), and incomplete belt/inserter setup for the assembler. The assembler is set to the correct recipe but lacks input materials.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Electric Mining Drill at Position(x=22.5, y=8.5) (Mining Coal, Status: NO_POWER)\n*   Electric Mining Drill at Position(x=25.5, y=8.5) (Mining Coal, Status: NO_POWER)\n*   Stone Furnace at Position(x=23.0, y=11.0) (Status: NO_FUEL, NO_INGREDIENTS)\n*   Stone Furnace at Position(x=26.0, y=11.0) (Status: NO_FUEL, NO_INGREDIENTS)\n*   Inserter (Furnace 1 -> Belt) at Position(x=23.5, y=12.5) (Status: NO_POWER, WA"}
