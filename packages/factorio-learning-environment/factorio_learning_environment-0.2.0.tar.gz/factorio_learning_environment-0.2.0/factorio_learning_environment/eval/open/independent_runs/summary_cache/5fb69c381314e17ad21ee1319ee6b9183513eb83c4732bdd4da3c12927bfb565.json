{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Partial pipe network (position x=-8.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### Boiler at position(x=-36.0, y=9.5) - Removed in step 14\nWas previously placed but removed during reconstruction attempts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Water source placement errors\n- Offshore pumps must be placed directly adjacent to water (max 1 tile away)\n- Verify water presence before attempting to place offshore pumps\n- Check terrain carefully when placing near water sources\n\n### Boiler placement errors\n- Ensure adequate space (2x3 tiles) is available for boiler placement\n- Remove existing entities before placing boilers\n- Verify boiler orientation matches pipe connections\n\n### API usage errors\n- Correctly use nearest() function with proper positional arguments\n- Verify function signatures before calling API methods\n- Handle error cases when water sources cannot be found\n\n### Power plant construction errors\n- Plan power plant locations near reliable water sources\n- Clear entire construction area before building\n- Verify all components can be placed before starting construction\n\n### Entity removal errors\n- Remove connected entities in proper order (pipes first, then machines)\n- Verify removal completes successfully before replacement attempts\n- Check for remaining entity fragments after removal\n\n### Distance-related errors\n- Move within operational range (10 tiles) before interacting with entities\n- Verify player position relative to construction targets\n- Use intermediate waypoints for distant operations"}
