{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) working on copper ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with full output of iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting various positions for ore movement.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) working to move iron ore.\n- Transport belts connecting various positions for ore movement.\n\n### Coal Mining System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. For example, the error \"No entity of type wooden-chest found at the specified position\" indicates that the entity was not present at position (-18.5, -64.5).\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Inserters at positions like (-17.5, -64.5) and (2.5, 0.5) are waiting for items, indicating a potential supply chain issue."}
