Specifically, verify the presence of a wooden chest containing iron ore before extraction.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient fuel\n- Regularly check and maintain sufficient fuel levels in mining drills and other fuel-dependent entities to prevent operational halts.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests and ensure they have enough space to accommodate incoming resources, preventing mining operations from stalling due to full chests."}
