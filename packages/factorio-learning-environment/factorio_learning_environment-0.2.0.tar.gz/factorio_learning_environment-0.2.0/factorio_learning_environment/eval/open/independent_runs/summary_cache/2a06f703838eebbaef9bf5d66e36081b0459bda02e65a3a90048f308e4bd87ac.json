{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generation system at x=-25.0 y=80.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at x=-20.5 y=69.5 (connected to water system)\n- Boiler at x=-25.0 y=80.5 (now working with coal fuel)\n- Steam engine at x=-25.5 y=89.5 (producing 13500-15000 power but not connected to network)\n- Pipe networks:\n  - Water system (ID 1454) connecting pump to boiler\n  - Steam system (ID 1458/1676) with connection issues between boiler and engine\n\n### Copper mining operation at x=-46.5 y=70.5 (expanded to x=-55.5 y=70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=-46.5 y=70.5 (output blocked, no power)\n- New electric mining drill at x=-55.5 y=70.5 (no power)\n- Stone furnace at x=-55.0 y=75.0 (no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at x=-55.5 y=73.5 (working)\n- Wooden chest at x=-55.5 y=76.5 (empty output storage)\n- Small electric pole at x=-53.5 y=72.5 (not powering drills)\n\n### Iron mining operation at x=15.5 y=70.5\n(No changes from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=15.5 y=70.5 (currently no power)\n- Stone furnace at x=16.0 y=74.0 (no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at x=15.5 y=72.5 (working)\n- Wooden chest at x=15.5 y=75.5 (empty output storage)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent power connection issues\n- Connect electric mining drills to power network (all drills show \"no power\")\n- Complete steam engine power network connection (producing power but not connected)\n- Verify small electric pole connections (poles exist but not powering drills)\n\n### Fluid system connection problems\n- Fix steam pipe connection between boiler (x=-25.0 y=80.5) and engine (x=-25.5 y=89.5)\n- Verify pipe alignment and connection points (failed connection attempt at x=-26.5 y=80.5)\n- Ensure unobstructed fluid paths between components\n\n### Entity verification failures\n- Verify entity existence before operations (repeated burner inserter access failures)\n- Implement position validation before entity placement\n- Track entity state changes (missing furnaces in some steps)\n\n### Production chain issues\n- Supply coal to all burner inserters and furnaces\n- Clear output blockages on mining drills\n- Verify inserter pickup/drop positions (x=-55.5 y=71.5 to x=-55.5 y=73.5)\n\n### System monitoring\n- Implement regular status checks for all production systems\n- Monitor fuel levels in boilers and furnaces\n- Track power production and consumption metrics"}
