{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Contains iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Out of fuel\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer materials between entities. Reposition and align inserters as needed to maintain a continuous flow of resources.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Refuel them promptly to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full. Extract items regularly to maintain space for incoming resources.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inserter setup and reposition if the furnace is not receiving materials.\n\n### Errors with Resource Extraction\n- Make sure to extract resources from entities only when necessary to free up space, ensuring that production is not halted due to full inventories."}
