{"content": "I'll create a report based on these execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Storage chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Chest inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n\nThe system is designed to mine coal, store it in a chest, and transport it via inserter and belt to a furnace. The mining drill is operational and the chest contains substantial coal (450+ units). The transport chain is partially working but has issues with the furnace inserter placement.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other objects\n- Multiple failed attempts to place burner-inserter due to existing objects in the way at positions (43.5, -81.0) and (44.5, -81.0)\n- When placing inserters near furnaces, ensure proper spacing and alignment\n\n### Resource Availability Issues\n- Check inventory before attempting to place entities - encountered \"No burner_inserter in inventory\" error\n- Verify required materials are available before crafting or placing structures\n\n### Transport Belt Interaction Issues\n- Ensure transport belts contain the expected resources before attempting extraction\n- Verify belt orientation and connections when setting up transport chains\n\n### Inserter Positioning and Orientation\n- Multiple attempts to adjust furnace inserter position and orientation suggest need for better initial placement planning\n- Consider the pickup and drop positions when placing inserters\n- Ensure inserters can reach both source and destination points\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails when location is occupied or invalid.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_inserter: burner-inserter type\n- mining_drill: burner-mining-drill type\n- coal_chest: container type\n- chest_inserter: burner-inserter type\n- belt_right: transport-belt type\n\nSystem Status Variables:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Indicates properly functioning entities\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Indicates full output buffer\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Indicates empty input buffer\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Indicates empty input buffer"}
