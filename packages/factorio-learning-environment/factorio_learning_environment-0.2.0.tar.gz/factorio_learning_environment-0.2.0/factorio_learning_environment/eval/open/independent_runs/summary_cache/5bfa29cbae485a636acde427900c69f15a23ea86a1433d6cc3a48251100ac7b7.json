{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5) which is not connected to the power network.\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0) with coal fuel and working status.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water.\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes running from positions (-5.5, 16.5) to (-2.5, 22.5), carrying steam.\n- **PipeGroup** carrying water from the offshore pump, with pipes running from positions (-8.5, 23.5) to (-4.5, 24.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, currently having no ingredients to smelt, and containing iron plates in the result inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variables in Code\n- Ensure all variables are properly defined before use. For example, the variable `steam_engine_buildable_area` was not defined before being used.\n\n### Incorrect Operand Types\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that the operands are of compatible types. For instance, avoid adding 'ModelPrivateAttr' to an 'int'.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting a steam engine failed due to missing iron plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n### Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Ensure that the required entities are available in the inventory before attempting to place them on the map. For example, placing a steam engine failed due to its absence in the inventory.\n\n### Connecting Entities Without Required Items\n- Make sure to have the necessary items in the inventory before attempting to connect entities. For instance, connecting pipes between the boiler and steam engine failed due to missing pipes in the inventory.\n\n### Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Confirm that the items you wish to insert are present in the inventory. For example, inserting coal into the boiler failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory."}
