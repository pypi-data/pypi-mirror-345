Ensure that the chosen fluid_system identifier matches a pipe group actually present within the connection radius.\n- Uniform Fluid_System Assignment:\n  - All components within the pipeline network\u2014boiler, offshore pump, and pipe groups\u2014must share a consistent fluid_system value. Mismatches lead to connection failures.\n- Inventory Attribute Consistency:\n  - Continue using only supported inventory attributes when accessing or modifying inventory items to avoid attribute-related errors."}
