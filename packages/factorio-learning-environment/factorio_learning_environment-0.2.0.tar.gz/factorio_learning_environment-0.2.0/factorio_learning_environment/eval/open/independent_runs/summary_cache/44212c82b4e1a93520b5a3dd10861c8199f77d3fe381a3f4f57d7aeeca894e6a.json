{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring iron plates to a wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt system\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore\n- Transport Belt system connecting various entities in the area\n\n### Coal Mining at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items to a wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connections\n- Ensure that transport belts are placed without gaps to maintain a continuous connection. Check the alignment and continuity of belts between positions, especially when connecting from x=-20.5, y=-67.5 to x=-21.5, y=-66.5.\n\n### Inserter Errors\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. Verify that the source container or belt is supplying items to the inserter's pickup position to avoid waiting status.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel burner entities to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes."}
