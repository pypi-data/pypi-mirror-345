{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure you are within a 10-tile radius of the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target location to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is not occupied by another entity or obstructed by terrain features like water. Consider adjusting the placement position or direction to avoid collisions.\n\n### Inserter alignment issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with both the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items, causing production halts.\n\n### Fuel shortages in inserters and furnaces\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Maintain a sufficient coal supply to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Chest overflow warnings\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent overflow. Empty chests regularly to continue mining operations and avoid production bottlenecks."}
