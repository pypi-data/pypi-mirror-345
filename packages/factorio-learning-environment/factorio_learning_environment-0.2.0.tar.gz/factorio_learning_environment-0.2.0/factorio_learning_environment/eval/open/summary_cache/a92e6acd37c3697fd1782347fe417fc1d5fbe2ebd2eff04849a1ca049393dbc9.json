{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with frequent full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) receiving iron plates, with burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) feeding the chests.\n- Small electric poles at (15.5, 75.5), (17.5, 72.5), (22.5, 75.5), and (12.5, 72.5) connected to power network.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace drop position remains unresolved, limiting throughput.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with improved power pole coverage, though output congestion persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal and working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (0.5, 6.5) connected to power network.\n- Coal inserted into boiler regularly to maintain operation.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) intended to feed iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine unable to craft due to persistent iron plate shortage; input and output inventories remain empty.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and inserter logistics in place but lacks input materials to function.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failure to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) and steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to collisions with existing entities (mining drill, poles).\n- Attempts to place poles with spacing 2 and direction UP failed; error messages suggest increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting reference position.\n- To avoid these errors, always check tile occupancy before placement, consider alternative nearby positions, and vary placement parameters.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters at iron plate storage chests frequently report waiting for source items due to empty chests.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel and ensure source chests contain required items to prevent inserter idling.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) remains unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates.\n- Input and output inventories of assembling machine and output chest at (25.5, 82.5) remain empty.\n- Attempts to extract iron gear wheels from output chest fail due to absence of crafted items.\n- Ensure sufficient iron plates are supplied to input chest at (21.5, 77.5) and verify inserters correctly move materials into assembling machine.\n\n### Output blockage and entity retrieval errors\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" limiting mining output.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently"}
