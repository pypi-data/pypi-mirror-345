{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map as all attempts to place entities have failed. The logs indicate that no entities have been successfully placed, and the map remains empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. The repeated errors in placing Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, ore inserters, plate inserters, and output chests suggest that the chosen locations are either occupied or unsuitable for placement.\n\n### Errors in pathfinding\n- When attempting to move to a new position, ensure that the path is clear and the destination is reachable. The error \"Could not get path from x=199.5 y=199.5 to x=400.5 y=400.0\" indicates that the pathfinding algorithm could not find a valid route. Verify that there are no obstacles blocking the path and that the destination is within the bounds of the map.\n\n### Errors with data types in movement\n- When handling coordinates or positions, ensure that indices are integers. The error \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" suggests a mismatch in expected data types. Double-check the data structures and ensure that all indices are correctly formatted as integers.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its ability to place entities and navigate the map effectively."}
