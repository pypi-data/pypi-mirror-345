If the chest is full, clear some space or move items to another storage.\n\n### Errors when Transferring Iron Ore to Furnaces\n- Verify that the source of the iron ore is accessible and not obstructed. Ensure that the furnace is ready to receive items and is not full or lacking fuel.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the inserters have access to source items and that the source is not empty. Ensure that the inserters are correctly positioned to pick up items from the source.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Ensure that the correct crafting machine or furnace is used for crafting items. Some items require specific machines or processes to be crafted.\n\n### Storage Management\n- Regularly check and manage storage to prevent overflow. Place additional storage if necessary to accommodate excess items.\n\nBy addressing these errors, you can improve the efficiency and functionality of your operations in the game."}
