{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron smelting setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n\n### Coal mine at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n\n### Iron smelting setup at position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (4.0, -60.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting\n- The agent attempts to craft items (burner-mining-drill, stone-furnace) without having all the required ingredients. Before crafting, ensure all necessary sub-ingredients are available in the inventory. For burner-mining-drill, the agent needs iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel and stone-furnace. For stone-furnace, the agent needs stone.\n- The agent attempts to craft iron-gear-wheel and burner-mining-drill without having iron-plate. Smelt iron-ore into iron-plate in a furnace before crafting these items.\n- The agent attempts to craft items (stone-furnace, wooden-chest) from raw resources (stone, wood). Raw resources must be harvested before crafting.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- The agent attempts to place a burner mining drill without having one in its inventory. Ensure the item is crafted and present in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n- The agent attempts to place a wooden chest too far away from the player. Move closer to the intended placement location before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- The agent attempts to insert items (coal, iron-ore) into a furnace when it doesn't have those items in its inventory. Ensure the items are in the inventory before attempting to insert them.\n- The agent attempts to insert items into a furnace, but the code specifies the item prototype incorrectly. Verify that the correct prototype (e.g., Prototype.Coal, Prototype.IronOre) is used when calling the insert_item function.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- The agent attempts to extract iron-ore from a chest that does not contain any iron-ore. Verify that the target entity contains the item being extracted.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- coal: int\n- iron-ore: int\n- stone-furnace: int\n- iron-plate: int\n- iron-gear-wheel: int\n- transport-belt: int\n- wood: int\n- wooden-chest: int\n"}
