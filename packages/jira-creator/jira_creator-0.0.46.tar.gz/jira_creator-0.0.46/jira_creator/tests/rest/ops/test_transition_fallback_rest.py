"""
This script contains a unit test for the migration functionality of an issue using a client object. It includes the
`test_migrate_fallback_transition` function, which tests the fallback transition during the migration process by
mocking HTTP requests made by the client. The test verifies that the issue is successfully migrated with the expected
key and tracks the transitions that have been called.

The `mock_request` function simulates HTTP requests, returning different responses based on the request's method and
path. It handles scenarios such as retrieving transitions, specific path endings, and comments.

Exceptions:
None
