Always retrieve the current working fluid_system from the boiler or offshore pump before initiating a connection.\n\n- Rigid Pipeline Stabilization:\n  \u2022 A fixed 10\u2010second delay for pipeline stabilization leads to premature connection attempts. Implement dynamic checks to confirm PipeGroup connectivity prior to proceeding.\n\n- Persistent Steam Engine Connection Failure:\n  \u2022 Continuous failures to connect the steam engine indicate misalignment or incompatibility between its connection points and the associated reservoirs. Reassess the spatial configuration and verify fluid system associations before retrying the connection."}
