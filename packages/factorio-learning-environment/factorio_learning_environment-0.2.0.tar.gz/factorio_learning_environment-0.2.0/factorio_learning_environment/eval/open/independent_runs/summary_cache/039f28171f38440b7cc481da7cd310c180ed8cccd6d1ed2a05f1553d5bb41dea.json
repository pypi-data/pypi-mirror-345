{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Functionality Issues\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (wooden chest) to the destination (stone furnace). Regularly check and adjust the inserter's alignment if the furnace is not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is operational and correctly configured to transfer iron ore to the furnace. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that may prevent the transfer of materials.\n\n### Chest Capacity Management\n- Monitor the capacity of the wooden chest to prevent it from becoming full. Regularly extract iron ore from the chest to maintain continuous mining operations and avoid warnings related to full chests.\n\n### Refueling of Entities\n- Regularly refuel the burner mining drill, burner inserter, and stone furnace with coal to ensure uninterrupted operation. Keep track of fuel levels to prevent any stoppages in the production line."}
