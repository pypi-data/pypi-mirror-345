{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nThis structure is designed for mining coal and consists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) to extract coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=51.5, y=-83.5) to collect coal from the mining drill.\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nThis setup is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates and consists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Belt Transport System\nThis system is designed to transport materials between different positions on the map and consists of:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=50.5, y=-84.5) to (x=52.5, y=-84.5) and outputs from (x=59.5, y=-84.5) to (x=59.5, y=-82.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=51.5, y=-83.5) to (x=53.5, y=-83.5) and outputs from (x=58.5, y=-81.5) to (x=60.5, y=-81.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates need to be smelted in a furnace, and stone is a raw resource that must be gathered.\n- Specifically, ensure that iron gear wheels and iron plates are available when crafting transport belts.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities without Inventory Items\n- Verify that the required item is in the inventory before attempting to place it. For instance, ensure a wooden chest is available before trying to place one.\n\n### Errors in Extracting from Non-existent or Empty Entities\n- Confirm the presence of the target entity and the required items within it before attempting extraction. For example, ensure the wooden chest contains coal before extracting.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Inventory Checks\n- Use assertions to check inventory levels only when certain that the inventory contains the expected items. This prevents unnecessary assertion errors, such as expecting coal in a chest when it is not present.\n\n### Errors with Connecting Entities due to Missing Items\n- Ensure that the required items, such as transport belts, are available in the inventory before attempting to connect entities. This error was frequently encountered when attempting to connect transport belts from position (x=51.5, y=-83.5) to (x=60.5, y=-81.5).\n\n### Index Errors in BeltGroup Setup\n- Verify the existence and correct indexing of BeltGroups before attempting operations. Ensure that the BeltGroup setup is correctly configured and accessible. This error was encountered multiple times when attempting to access a BeltGroup that did not exist.\n\n### Errors with BeltGroup Configuration\n- Double-check the configuration of BeltGroups to ensure they are correctly set up and functional. Ensure that all necessary connections and components are in place. The repeated message \"No BeltGroup found. Please check the setup.\" indicates a persistent issue with BeltGroup configuration.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities at Distant Locations\n- Ensure you are within the allowable distance to place an entity. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity, such as a wooden chest, to avoid placement errors due to distance constraints."}
