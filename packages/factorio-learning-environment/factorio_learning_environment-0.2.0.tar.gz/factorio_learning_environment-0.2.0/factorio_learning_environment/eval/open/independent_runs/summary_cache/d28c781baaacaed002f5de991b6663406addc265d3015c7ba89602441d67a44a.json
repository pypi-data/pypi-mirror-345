For example, 'PipeGroup' object has no attribute 'warnings'. \n### Errors when using unary operators\n- Be cautious when using unary operators on objects. For example, bad operand type for unary -: 'BurnerMiningDrill'. Ensure the object supports the operation.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- `analyze_entities`: (inputs: entities on the map, outputs: entity status and warnings, typehints: EntityStatus, List[str]) - Analyzes entities on the map and prints their status and warnings.\n    - Success mode: Successfully prints entity status and warnings.\n    - Failure mode: Fails when an entity does not have a 'warnings' attribute.\n- Important variables: \n    - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] \n    - `entity`: Entity \n    - `entity_status`: EntityStatus \n    - `warnings`: List[str]"}
