Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source from which the inserter is supposed to pick up items is not empty. Regularly supply source entities with necessary items to avoid idle inserters.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Monitor chest inventories to prevent them from becoming full, which can cause production halts. Use additional storage or manage item flow to prevent overflow.\n\nThese tips should help in maintaining efficient operations and avoiding common pitfalls in the current setup."}
