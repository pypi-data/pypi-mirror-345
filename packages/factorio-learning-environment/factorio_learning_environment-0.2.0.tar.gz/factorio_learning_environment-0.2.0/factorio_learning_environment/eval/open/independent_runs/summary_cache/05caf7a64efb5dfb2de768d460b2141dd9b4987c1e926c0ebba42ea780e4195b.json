{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (around x=-28, y=-61)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) for copper ore extraction\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5) for collecting copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5) to move ore from chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) to move plates from furnace\n- Collection chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing iron and copper plates\n\n### Iron Mining Complex (around x=-10, y=-59)\nConsists of three mining drills in sequence:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0) \n- Burner mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0)\nConnected to collection system:\n- Collection chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters and transport belts forming item movement chain\n- Belt system connecting to main factory area\n\n### Main Factory Smelting Line (around x=0, y=0)\nFour parallel smelting columns, each consisting of:\n- Input chest at top (y=-2.5)\n- Burner inserter moving items to furnace\n- Stone furnace for smelting\n- Output burner inserter\n- Collection chest at bottom (y=2.5)\nColumns positioned at x coordinates: 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Placement Issues\n- Ensure inserters have valid pickup and drop positions before placement\n- Check that inserters can reach both source and destination entities\n\n### Entity Output Blockage\n- When placing mining drills, ensure there is a valid output collection system (chest or belt)\n- When setting up inserters, verify the destination entity can accept items\n\n### Resource Flow Issues\n- Ensure complete material flow paths from source to destination\n- Check that all transport belts are properly connected and oriented\n- Verify inserters have appropriate fuel supply to maintain operation\n\n### Space Management\n- Check for entity overlap before placement\n- Ensure sufficient space between production lines for logistics"}
