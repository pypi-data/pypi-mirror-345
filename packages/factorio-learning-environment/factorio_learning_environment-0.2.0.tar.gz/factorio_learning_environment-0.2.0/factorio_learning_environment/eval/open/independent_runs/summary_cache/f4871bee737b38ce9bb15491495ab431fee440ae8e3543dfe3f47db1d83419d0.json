{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=15.0, y=0.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\" and status \"NO_INGREDIENTS\".\n- Inserter at Position (x=17.5, y=0.5) with status \"NO_POWER\", connected to a small electric pole at Position (x=17.5, y=-0.5) and a wooden chest at Position (x=18.5, y=0.5).\n- Inserter at Position (x=16.5, y=0.5) with status \"NO_POWER\", connected to a stone furnace at Position (x=15.0, y=0.0) and a small electric pole at Position (x=17.5, y=-0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=18.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Pipe Infrastructure\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=-12.5, y=19.5) with status \"EMPTY\", consisting of pipes connecting various positions.\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=-8.5, y=23.5) with status \"EMPTY\", consisting of pipes connecting various positions.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 2441, consisting of poles at various positions, currently with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Power Infrastructure Setup\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) and the boiler at Position (x=-5.5, y=25.0). Check for any missing or misaligned pipes.\n- Verify that the steam engine is correctly placed and connected to the boiler. Ensure the steam engine exists at the specified position before attempting connections.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Network\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are properly connected to the electricity network. Check that small electric poles are placed and connected to provide power to inserters and other entities.\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of small electric poles to avoid connection issues.\n- Ensure the electricity network is plugged in and active to provide power to all connected entities.\n\n### Errors in Placing Mining Drills\n- Verify the position before placing mining drills to ensure they are placed on a valid resource patch. Adjust the position if placement fails.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check inventory levels to ensure you have the necessary items for construction and connection tasks.\n- Address warnings such as \"not receiving electricity\" by ensuring all power connections are intact and functional.\n- Craft additional small electric poles if inventory is depleted to maintain a functional electricity network."}
