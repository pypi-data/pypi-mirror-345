{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that converts iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the produced iron plates.\nUpdates:\n- Steps 38\u201347: Produced and extracted multiple batches of iron plates; experienced a temporary halt due to insufficient raw materials.\n- Steps 48\u201349: Inserted additional iron ore into the furnace; updated furnace inventory showing 14 remaining iron ore and 5 iron plates processed along with 25 coal as fuel.\n- Step 51: Inserted 10 additional iron ore into the furnace resulting in a processed inventory update to 7 iron ore and 15 iron plates after a 10\u2011second processing interval.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient resource availability and inventory mismanagement\n- Confirm resource presence and necessary quantities before insertion into processing structures to prevent intermittent halts.\n\n### Processing timing and ingredient replenishment delays\n- Align waiting intervals with processing cycles and monitor ingredient levels to avoid processing warnings.\n\n### Stale entity status data usage\n- Refresh entity data frequently to prevent reliance on outdated information, ensuring that decisions are based on current map state.\n\n### Repeated stale map data display errors\n- Validate that API calls return current entity information rather than stale snapshots, especially after critical updates to structure inventories."}
