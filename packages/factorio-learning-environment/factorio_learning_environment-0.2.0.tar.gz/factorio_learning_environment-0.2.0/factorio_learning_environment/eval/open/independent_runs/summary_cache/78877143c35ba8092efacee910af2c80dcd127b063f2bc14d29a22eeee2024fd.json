{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)  \n- **Wooden chest** at position (41.5, -80.5)  \n\nThe burner mining drill is actively mining coal and dropping it into the wooden chest.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in non-buildable positions\n- Ensure the target position is clear and buildable before attempting to place entities like transport belts, burner mining drills, or wooden chests.  \n- Use the `move_to_buildable_area` function to find a suitable location before placing entities.\n\n#### Errors when referencing undefined variables\n- Always define variables like `transport_belt` before using them in conditional statements or operations.  \n- Initialize variables with valid entities or values to avoid `NameError`.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of the target entity (e.g., burner mining drill or furnace) before attempting to insert items like coal.  \n- Use the `get_entity` function to confirm the entity is present at the specified position.\n\n#### Errors when moving to non-buildable areas\n- Double-check the coordinates when moving to a buildable area to ensure they are valid and accessible.  \n- Use the `move_to_buildable_area` function to find a suitable location before placing entities.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- Ensure the entity (e.g., stone furnace) exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it.  \n- Use the `get_entity` function to confirm the entity's presence before performing operations."}
