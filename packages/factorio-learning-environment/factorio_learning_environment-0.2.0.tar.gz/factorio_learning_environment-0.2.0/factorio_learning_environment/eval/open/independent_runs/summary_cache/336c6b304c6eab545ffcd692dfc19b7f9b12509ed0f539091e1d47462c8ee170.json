{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Structure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) intended for smelting iron ore, but currently not receiving any due to misalignment issues.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace, but facing alignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Placement\n- Ensure there is enough space and the correct direction is set when placing inserters. Avoid placing inserters where they might collide with existing entities like chests or furnaces. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring materials from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's input.\n\n### Frequent Misalignment of Entities\n- Regularly verify the positioning of all entities to ensure they are correctly aligned for optimal operation. Misalignment can lead to inefficiencies or non-functioning setups, as seen with the furnace not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as inserters and furnaces, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check fuel levels to prevent interruptions."}
