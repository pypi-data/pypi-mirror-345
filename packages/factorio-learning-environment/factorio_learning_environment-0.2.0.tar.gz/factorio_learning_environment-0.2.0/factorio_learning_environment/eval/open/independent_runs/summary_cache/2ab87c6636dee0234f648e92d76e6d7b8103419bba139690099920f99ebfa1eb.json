{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -86.0) and a chest at position (41.5, -84.5)\n- Burner mining drill (position 43.0, -86.0) and a chest at position (43.5, -84.5)\n- Burner inserter (position 41.5, -83.5) connecting the belt to the chest at (41.5, -82.5)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -17.0, -52.0) and a chest at position (-16.5, -50.5)\n- Burner inserter (position -17.5, -50.5) connecting the mining drill to the chest at (-16.5, -50.5)\n\n#### Smelting Setup at position (-15.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -51.0) with a burner inserter (position -14.5, -52.5) and a chest at position (-13.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace (position -13.0, -50.0) with a burner inserter (position -11.5, -50.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a chest with insufficient quantity\n- Ensure the chest contains the required quantity of items before attempting to extract them.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are out of fuel\n- Always ensure mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Refill them with coal or other fuel sources as needed.\n\n#### Errors when chests at drop positions are full\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue operating.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) for smelting."}
