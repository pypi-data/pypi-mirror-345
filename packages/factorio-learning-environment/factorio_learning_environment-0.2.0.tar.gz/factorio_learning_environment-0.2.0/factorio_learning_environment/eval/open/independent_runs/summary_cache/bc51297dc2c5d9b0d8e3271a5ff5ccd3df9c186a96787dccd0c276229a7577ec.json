{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Ore Mining Section**: \n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storage of mined iron ore.\n- **Iron Plate Production Section**:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items between chests.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storing mined coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) and another at position (-21.0, -62.0) for smelting operations.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) and another at position (-17.5, -64.5) for transferring items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) for storing processed iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of several BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-21.5, -64.5) to (-21.5, -66.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -63.5) to (-14.5, -65.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-17.5, -62.5) to (-17.5, -64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-16.5, -64.5) to (-12.5, -58.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum allowed distance (10 units) from the target position before placing an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Non-existent Entities\n- Double-check the position of the entity you intend to pick up to ensure it exists at the specified location. This will prevent errors related to attempting to pick up non-existent entities."}
