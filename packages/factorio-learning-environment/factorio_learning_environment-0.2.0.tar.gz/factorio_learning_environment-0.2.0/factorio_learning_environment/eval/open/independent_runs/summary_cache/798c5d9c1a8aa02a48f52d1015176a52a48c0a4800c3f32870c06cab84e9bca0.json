{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at (15.5, 70.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) facing DOWN (output at 15.5, 72.5)\n- Small electric pole at (13.5, 69.5) powering the drill\n- Stone furnace at (16.0, 73.0) facing UP (new position)\n- Wooden chest at (16.5, 74.5)\n- Transport belts connecting drill to furnace (positions: (15.5,72.5) to (24.5,70.5))\n\n### Power generation setup at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) connected via pipes to:\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 3.5) (now has coal fuel)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5, 3.5) (still not connected to power network)\n- Pipe network connecting offshore pump to boiler (positions: (-8.5,-0.5), (-6.5,-0.5), (-7.5,-0.5), (-4.5,-0.5), (-5.5,-0.5), (-3.5,-0.5))\n- Power pole at (3.5, 3.5) (existing)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement collision errors (continued)\n- Verify target position is clear before placing entities (now with 12 total occurrences)\n- Added specific water avoidance checks when placing near shorelines (3 water-related placement failures)\n- When replacing existing setups, clear old entities first before placing new ones\n\n### Power system improvements\n- Steam engine still not connected despite boiler being fueled - verify power pole connections\n- Check power network coverage when placing new electrical devices\n\n### Furnace placement strategy\n- Survey terrain carefully before attempting furnace placement (4 failed attempts)\n- Maintain minimum distance from water bodies when placing production structures\n- Consider pre-clearing areas before attempting large placements\n\n### Entity verification\n- Verify entity existence before attempting operations on them (failed stone furnace check)\n- Implement position validation before placement attempts\n\n### Production chain planning\n- Ensure complete clearance of old transport belts before redesigning layouts\n- Verify all components are properly spaced before finalizing production chains\n\n### Power connection verification\n- Double-check power pole placements to avoid duplicate placement attempts\n- Verify electrical connections after placing new power poles"}
