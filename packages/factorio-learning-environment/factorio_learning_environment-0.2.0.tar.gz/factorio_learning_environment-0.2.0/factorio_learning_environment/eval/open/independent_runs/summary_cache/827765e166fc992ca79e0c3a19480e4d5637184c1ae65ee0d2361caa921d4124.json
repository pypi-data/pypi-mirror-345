{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Extracts crude oil (299970 crude oil remaining)\n- **Storage tank** at (21.5,41.5) - Stores crude oil (currently holding 39.2 crude oil)\n- Connected by PipeGroup (fluid_system=962) for crude oil transport\n\n### Power Generation System at (26.5,42.0)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Provides water\n- **Boiler** at (26.5,42.0) - Burns coal to heat water (currently has 30 coal)\n- **Steam engine** at (29.5,42.5) - Generates 13500 energy from steam\n- Connected by:\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=953) for water transport\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=963) for steam transport\n- Powered by electricity group (id=566) with 6 small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Pipe network access errors\n- Verify pipe groups exist before accessing them (StopIteration/IndexError when querying fluid_system=249/689/732/777)\n- Use get_entities() with proper filters and handle empty results when locating pipe groups\n\n### Storage tank placement failures\n- Multiple failed attempts to place storage tank at:\n  - Right of existing tank (positions 25.5,41.5 and 27.5,41.5)\n  - Left of existing tank\n  - Below existing tank\n  - Northwest position (18.5,38.5)\n- Solutions:\n  - Check for existing entities before placement attempts\n  - Use larger spacing (minimum 2 tiles)\n  - Consider alternative locations away from existing infrastructure\n  - Verify terrain is buildable (not water)\n\n### Power system management\n- Monitor boiler fuel levels (currently 30 coal)\n- Maintain backup fuel supply to prevent power interruptions\n- Current power production (13500) matches consumption\n\n### Fluid system monitoring\n- Current oil production (848/min) exceeds target (250/min) by 339%\n- Water production (248/min) exceeds steam production (188/min)\n- Consider optimizing pumpjack operation if resource conservation is desired\n\n### General placement\n- Verify target position is clear before placing new entities\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to allow connections\n- Check both surface and underground entities when evaluating placement locations"}
