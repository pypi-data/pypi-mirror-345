{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Line at y=0.0\nConsists of four stone furnaces in a row:\n- Working furnace at x=0.0 (contains coal and iron ore, producing iron plates)\n- Working furnace at x=2.0 (contains coal and iron ore, producing iron plates)\n- Non-working furnace at x=4.0 (empty, no fuel or materials)\n- Non-working furnace at x=6.0 (empty, no fuel or materials)\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Resource availability errors\n- Check inventory for required resources before attempting to insert items into entities\n- Ensure you have both fuel (coal) and raw materials (ore) before setting up multiple furnaces\n- Consider harvesting more resources when inventory is depleted instead of continuing to place empty structures\n\n### Furnace efficiency\n- Avoid placing furnaces without having resources ready to fuel and supply them\n- Set up furnaces one at a time, ensuring each is properly supplied before moving to the next one"}
