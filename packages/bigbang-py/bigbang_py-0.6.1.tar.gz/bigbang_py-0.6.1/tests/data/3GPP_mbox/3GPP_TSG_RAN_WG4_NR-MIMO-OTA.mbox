Dear NR MIMO OTA Colleagues,

Please find attached an advanced copy of the TPs for FR2 DoT, and FR2 channel=
 verification. The previously submitted TPs did not have the "Track Changes" =
turned on, so it is difficult to see what changes are being proposed.

The attached are expected to be submitted as revised TPs.

Apologies for the inconvenience.

Regards,
Alfonso

[EXTERNAL]
Dear Thorsten,

Thank you very much for providing these result, I will revise my Tdoc accordi=
ngly.

I have 2 more questions for understanding

  1.  In the simulations, did you apply any optimization method for both sect=
or and ring layouts e.g. prefaded signals synthesis etc.? or it is based on d=
irect sampling of  the theoretically continuous PAS (power angular spectrum)?
[Thorsten@KS] Yes, we used optimization methods for both layouts, i.e., we nu=
merically optimized the probe weights to reduce the weighted RMS correlation =
error. We have looked into the direct sampling approach and found a larger er=
ror and therefore decided to stick with our optimization approach.

  1.  Are you going to propose option 6 also for chamber calibration procedur=
e? It seems too complex?
[Thorsten@KS] No, this will be too complex for spatial correlation validation=
 purposes since there would be too many measurements required.

Best Regards

Lin Hui

Hi,

Sorry about the delay but here are the comparisons of Options 5 and 6 you ask=
ed for. We only considered the two frequencies we studied previously though
Correlation error vs number of probes
Option 5 (D=3D40cm) (same as Fig. 7 in R4-1906829)
[A close up of a map  Description generated with high confidence]
Option 6 (D=3D20cm)

[EXTERNAL]
Dear Thorsten,

We noticed that you simulated Option 5 with 40cm test zone size i.e. radius=
=3D20cm.

Regarding switch from option 5 to option 6, obviously, RSM calculated by opti=
on 6 will be much larger than option5 for the same layout and the same test z=
one size, because of calculating larger correlation distance.

I have 2 suggestions for consideration:

  1.  We relied on the simulations from your contributions for the study. Cur=
rently all these results are based on option 5. Could you please provide upda=
ted results before October meeting? i.e. figure7 in  R4-1906829, figure 3 in =
R4-1909728 etc (as below).  At least 2~3 days before contribution deadline wo=
uld be preferred, in order to facilitate discussion in the meeting.
  2.  Another suggestion is that the RMS results are for 3.5GHz and 7.15GHz (=
7.125?) in figure7 and 7.125GHz in figure3. Could you please add 4.9GHz (N79)=
? If it is not too troublesome. Because during the offline discussion, some o=
perators were interested in the situation of this band.

Subject: Weighted RMS Correlation Error for NR FR1: Option 5 --> 6 Proposal

Dear NR MIMO OTA Crew,

After offline feedback received and offline discussions with Spirent and CAIC=
T, I would like to run the suggestion to switch from option 5 to option 6 for=
 the weighted RMS correlation error NR FR1 analyses by this group.

As outlined in contribution R4-1906829, we outlined 6 different options to de=
termine the RMS correlation error:
The definition of [1] opens at least six interpretations. They are illustrate=
d in Figure 1 and described as follows:

  1.  The spatial correlation is evaluated between locations along a 20cm lon=
g segment of line centred at the origin and being orthogonal to the highest p=
ower direction of the PAS (=3D ** =3D mean of PAS). The reference location is=
 the origin and the other location changes symmetrically to left and right fr=
om the origin. This should result to a symmetrical spatial correlation functi=
on and the maximum spacing to be evaluated is 10cm.
  2.  As interpretation 1. but the reference point is, e.g., one end of the s=
egment of line. This results to a non-symmetric spatial correlation function =
and the maximum spacing to be evaluated is 20cm.
  3.  The spatial correlation is evaluated between the origin and locations o=
n a circle centred at the origin and having the radius of 10cm. This should r=
esult to a periodic spatial correlation function and only the spacing of 10cm=
 is evaluated with different orientations with respect to the PAS.
  4.  The spatial correlation is evaluated between locations on a circle cent=
red at the origin and having the radius of 10cm. There is not a fixed referen=
ce point, but all pairs of sample points along the circle are considered. The=
 maximum spacing to be evaluated is 20cm.
  5.  The spatial correlation is evaluated between the origin and locations w=
ithin a circular disc centred at the origin and having the radius of 10cm. Th=
e maximum spacing to be evaluated is 10cm.
  6.  The spatial correlation is evaluated between locations within a circula=
r disc centred at the origin and having the radius of 10cm. There is not a fi=
xed reference point, but all pairs of sample points within the disc are consi=
dered. The maximum spacing to be evaluated is 20cm.

Figure 1. Illustrations of six sampling assumptions for spatial correlation e=
valuation.



Observation 1: The spatial correlation validation procedure, specifically the=
 sampling assumptions, need to be agreed as the current definition is ambiguo=
us
In this contribution we follow interpretation #5. However, because the spatia=
l correlation would be evaluated only with maximum spacing of 10cm we have in=
creased the radius of the disc to 20cm. By this change we evaluate the spatia=
l correlation function on distances up to 20cm, which is the agreed maximum D=
UT and test zone size in [1].

We settled on Option 5, i.e., a disc with 20cm radius (40cm diameter) and max=
 antenna separation of 20cm, in May but based on feedback received offline fo=
lks were not pleased with the selected option since it does not comply with t=
he 20cm test zone size. In order to avoid any confusion and after some intern=
al discussions with CAICT and Spirent on this, we propose to focus on Option =
6 instead (20cm diameter disc with 20cm max antenna separation).

Sorry about the late notice but we hope to get preliminary agreement on this =
revised option before the meeting.

Dear Thorsten,

 

Thank you very much for providing these result, I will revise my Tdoc
accordingly.

 

I have 2 more questions for understanding

1)       In the simulations, did you apply any optimization method for both
sector and ring layouts e.g. prefaded signals synthesis etc.? or it is based
on direct sampling of  the theoretically continuous PAS (power angular
spectrum)?

2)       Are you going to propose option 6 also for chamber calibration
procedure? It seems too complex? 

 

Best Regards

 

Lin Hui

Dear NR MIMO OTA Crew, 

 

After offline feedback received and offline discussions with Spirent and
CAICT, I would like to run the suggestion to switch from option 5 to option
6 for the weighted RMS correlation error NR FR1 analyses by this group. 

 

As outlined in contribution R4-1906829, we outlined 6 different options to
determine the RMS correlation error:

The definition of [1] opens at least six interpretations. They are
illustrated in Figure 1 and described as follows:

1.	The spatial correlation is evaluated between locations along a 20cm
long segment of line centred at the origin and being orthogonal to the
highest power direction of the PAS (= qm = mean of PAS). The reference
location is the origin and the other location changes symmetrically to left
and right from the origin. This should result to a symmetrical spatial
correlation function and the maximum spacing to be evaluated is 10cm.
2.	As interpretation 1. but the reference point is, e.g., one end of
the segment of line. This results to a non-symmetric spatial correlation
function and the maximum spacing to be evaluated is 20cm.
3.	The spatial correlation is evaluated between the origin and
locations on a circle centred at the origin and having the radius of 10cm.
This should result to a periodic spatial correlation function and only the
spacing of 10cm is evaluated with different orientations with respect to the
PAS.
4.	The spatial correlation is evaluated between locations on a circle
centred at the origin and having the radius of 10cm. There is not a fixed
reference point, but all pairs of sample points along the circle are
considered. The maximum spacing to be evaluated is 20cm.
5.	The spatial correlation is evaluated between the origin and
locations within a circular disc centred at the origin and having the radius
of 10cm. The maximum spacing to be evaluated is 10cm.
6.	The spatial correlation is evaluated between locations within a
circular disc centred at the origin and having the radius of 10cm. There is
not a fixed reference point, but all pairs of sample points within the disc
are considered. The maximum spacing to be evaluated is 20cm.

 



Figure 1. Illustrations of six sampling assumptions for spatial correlation
evaluation.

 

Observation 1: The spatial correlation validation procedure, specifically
the sampling assumptions, need to be agreed as the current definition is
ambiguous 

In this contribution we follow interpretation #5. However, because the
spatial correlation would be evaluated only with maximum spacing of 10cm we
have increased the radius of the disc to 20cm. By this change we evaluate
the spatial correlation function on distances up to 20cm, which is the
agreed maximum DUT and test zone size in [1].

 

We settled on Option 5, i.e., a disc with 20cm radius (40cm diameter) and
max antenna separation of 20cm, in May but based on feedback received
offline folks were not pleased with the selected option since it does not
comply with the 20cm test zone size. In order to avoid any confusion and
after some internal discussions with CAICT and Spirent on this, we propose
to focus on Option 6 instead (20cm diameter disc with 20cm max antenna
separation).

 

Sorry about the late notice but we hope to get preliminary agreement on this
revised option before the meeting.

Dear Thorsten,

We noticed that you simulated Option 5 with 40cm test zone size i.e. radius=
=3D20cm.

Regarding switch from option 5 to option 6, obviously, RSM calculated by opti=
on 6 will be much larger than option5 for the same layout and the same test z=
one size, because of calculating larger correlation distance.

I have 2 suggestions for consideration:

  1.  We relied on the simulations from your contributions for the study. Cur=
rently all these results are based on option 5. Could you please provide upda=
ted results before October meeting? i.e. figure7 in  R4-1906829, figure 3 in =
R4-1909728 etc (as below).  At least 2~3 days before contribution deadline wo=
uld be preferred, in order to facilitate discussion in the meeting.
  2.  Another suggestion is that the RMS results are for 3.5GHz and 7.15GHz (=
7.125?) in figure7 and 7.125GHz in figure3. Could you please add 4.9GHz (N79)=
? If it is not too troublesome. Because during the offline discussion, some o=

Figure 1. Illustrations of six sampling assumptions for spatial correlation e=
valuation.



Observation 1: The spatial correlation validation procedure, specifically the=
 sampling assumptions, need to be agreed as the current definition is ambiguo=
us
In this contribution we follow interpretation #5. However, because the spatia=
l correlation would be evaluated only with maximum spacing of 10cm we have in=
creased the radius of the disc to 20cm. By this change we evaluate the spatia=
l correlation function on distances up to 20cm, which is the agreed maximum D=
UT and test zone size in [1].

We settled on Option 5, i.e., a disc with 20cm radius (40cm diameter) and max=
 antenna separation of 20cm, in May but based on feedback received offline fo=
lks were not pleased with the selected option since it does not comply with t=
he 20cm test zone size. In order to avoid any confusion and after some intern=
al discussions with CAICT and Spirent on this, we propose to focus on Option =
6 instead (20cm diameter disc with 20cm max antenna separation).

Sorry about the late notice but we hope to get preliminary agreement on this =
revised option before the meeting.

Thorsten

No, it was agreed to use RMS error and consider weighted as alternative

Dear Ruixin

Thank you very much for the WF.

In page4, there is a sentence
=E2=80=A2        RMS Spatial correlation error of LTE MIMO OTA channel model =
(i.e. UMi and UMa) is selected as a reference (i.e. the error between ideal c=
hannel model correlation and  theoretical LTE 8 probes correlation within 1l)

I think we never discuss whether to select the reference. If the LTE value re=
ally needs to be captured in this WF, the sentence in your adhoc agenda could=
 be better. Which is as below.

[For information]  The RMS correlation error of LTE UMa channel model vs 8 pr=
obes is about 0.067
Thank you.

Dear Ruixin,

Thanks a lot for sending the WF. We have a couple of comments regarding the f=
ollowing proposals.

1. =E2=80=9CUse the non-weighted RMS correlation error for NR FR1=E2=80=9D

I guess that this proposal came into play after I asked about the specific we=
ights that get used in weighted RMS correlation error. Actually, as I mention=
ed during the ad-hoc, I have no intention of precluding weighted RMS correlat=
ion error approach. In fact, internally, we have observed that weighted RMS c=
orrelation error approach may lead to better performances. However, it depend=
s on how we are selecting the weights. That=E2=80=99s why, I wanted to know h=
ow weights get selected.

I suggest that we don=E2=80=99t down-select between =E2=80=98weighted=E2=80=
=99 and =E2=80=98non-weighted=E2=80=99 RMS correlation error. Keysight can po=
int to us their previous contribution in 2017 where they mentioned the weight=
 selection process for =E2=80=98weighted RMS correlation error=E2=80=99 appro=
ach (or we can get it from them offline =F0=9F=98=8A). We can down-select in =
the next meeting.

2. =E2=80=9CTest the UE in FS DML, and FS DMP for FR2, other orientations are=
 not precluded=E2=80=9D

We think that the UE should be tested in FS DSMU mode as well. So, we are not=
 sure why this won=E2=80=99t be included in the baseline test setup for FR2.

Thanks,
Nazmul

Hi Thorsten,

I was taking a look at the antenna element parameters phi_3dB and Amax are mi=

f the vertical cut theta_3dB and SLAv.

If you agree, could you please add those?

Hi,

After the approval of the channel model tables in R4-1907712&R4-1907713, we r=
ealized an error in the CDL-C tables. By accident, we used same cluster IDs (=
2-4 and 5-7) for midpath power division in CDL-C as for CDL-A. For CDL-C, clu=
sters IDs to which power division should be made are 2-4 and 6-8.

Please find revised tables attached here. I hope that we can approve these ta=
bles later today when we return to the NR MIMO agenda.

Additionally, we tabulated AS parameters for LOS-models (D and E) properly de=
pending on UMi/UMa (K-factor of 9dB) vs InO (K-factor of 7dB).

Sorry about the inconvenience.

Thorsten

Dear Nazmul,=20

After offline discussions with Spirent on the differences between our results=
, we came to the conclusions that some of the scaling procedures should be cl=
arified and augmented with additional steps. This clarification will be inclu=
ded in one of our contributions.

Hi Thorsten and Alfonso,

I did the calculations for CDL-C and CDL-A based on equation A-1, A-2 and A-3=
 of 25.996. The ASA, for CDL-A model, turned out to be 84.98 degree for me. T=
he ASD, ZSD and ZSA values of CDL-A; and all angular spread values of CDL-C t=
urned out to be same as the ones reported in R4-1904197.

I wonder if these discrepancies are arising because these values are based on=
 equation A-3 of 25.996 and that equation is performing a linear sum of weigh=
ted angles. A linear sum of angles may lead to some ambiguity, e.g., the dire=
ct computation of mean of 179 and -179 degree is 0 degree. But, in real angul=
ar space, the mean of 179 and -179 degree should be 180 degree.

In this context, I wonder why we don=E2=80=99t use equation A-1 of 38.901 ins=
tead to calculate these angular spreads? Equation A-1 of 38.901 is based on s=
um of e^(j=E2=88=85) instead of =E2=88=85 and this might lead to consistent a=
ngular spread result among different company=E2=80=99s calculations (?).

Thanks,
Nazmul

Hi Thorsten,

I changed the angle spread formula to reflect the latest version of 25.996 po=
inted in your email directly below. I got the exact same value for AS, 85.56 =
degrees.

I then evaluated the expression for [cid:image008.png@01D4FF67.2A012720] usin=
g the CDL A table in 38.901, and I get a totally different results, I get -1.=

Hi Thorsten,

Thanks.

Looking at your contribution (4197), the AS is calculated using the equation =
in TR 25.996 without searching for the minimum over shifts (capital delta), w=
here the mean angle is calculated using the equation in annex A.2 of 38.901. =
If KS and Spirent are operating on the same data set (CDL Tables from 38.901)=
, we should get about the same value.

Could you please provide the mean angle for original CDL A?

The value that we get for the mean angle of the original CDL A is -164.4029 d=
egrees. This will help finding the source of the discrepancy.

Alfonso

Hi Thorsten,

Thanks for providing the very first denormalized and scaled channel model tab=

We were able to match the numbers in the tables to a reasonable level.

We get a slightly different value for ASA before any scaling for the highligh=
ted value.  The other values match very closely.  Since the ASA and other val=
ues are based on published numbers, we are wondering if there is an inaccurac=
y in this value?  This difference in value is then showing up as an error in =
calculated AoA calculations in the scaled results for our values compared to =
the KS values.

For CDL-A ASA we get 85.56 compared to 85.3, which is quite a large differenc=
e.

Since the Target AS and the Original AS is forming a ratio and being multipli=
ed by large angles, this makes it important to have the most accurate values =
possible.

Thank you for the clarification.

Alfonso

Ruixin,

We believe it is more important to focus on the propagation parameters, i.e.,=
 without the effect of BS antenna filtering, and agree on the tables that are=
 actually entered into the CM. At this point, we do not see much value in cre=

Hi Thorsten, and all

Thanks for your feedback. The scaled channel model is the first thing we need=
 to align next meeting. Furthermore, in my understanding, the spatial correla=

Dear NR MIMO OTA=E2=80=99ers,

As discussed last week and as captured in the WF

  *   Companies to share the resulting channel model table in the NR MIMO OTA=
 reflector before next RAN4 meeting. Suggested order is CDL-A with UMi and CD=

Keysight would like to share the scaled channel model table (without the dith=

Hi Thorsten,

Thanks.

Looking at your contribution (4197), the AS is calculated using the equation =

here the mean angle is calculated using the equation in annex A.2 of 38.901. =
If KS and Spirent are operating on the same data set (CDL Tables from 38.901)=

Could you please provide the mean angle for original CDL A?

The value that we get for the mean angle of the original CDL A is -164.4029 d=

We get a slightly different value for ASA before any scaling for the highligh=

ues are based on published numbers, we are wondering if there is an inaccurac=
y in this value?  This difference in value is then showing up as an error in =
calculated AoA calculations in the scaled results for our values compared to =
the KS values.

For CDL-A ASA we get 85.56 compared to 85.3, which is quite a large differenc=
e.

Since the Target AS and the Original AS is forming a ratio and being multipli=
ed by large angles, this makes it important to have the most accurate values =
possible.

Thank you for the clarification.

Hi Thorsten,

Thanks.

Looking at your contribution (4197), the AS is calculated using the equation =
in TR 25.996 without searching for the minimum over shifts (capital delta), w=
here the mean angle is calculated using the equation in annex A.2 of 38.901. =
If KS and Spirent are operating on the same data set (CDL Tables from 38.901)=
, we should get about the same value.

Could you please provide the mean angle for original CDL A?

The value that we get for the mean angle of the original CDL A is -164.4029 d=
egrees. This will help finding the source of the discrepancy.

Regards,
Alfonso

We get a slightly different value for ASA before any scaling for the highligh=

ues are based on published numbers, we are wondering if there is an inaccurac=
y in this value?  This difference in value is then showing up as an error in =
calculated AoA calculations in the scaled results for our values compared to =
the KS values.

For CDL-A ASA we get 85.56 compared to 85.3, which is quite a large differenc=
e.

Since the Target AS and the Original AS is forming a ratio and being multipli=
ed by large angles, this makes it important to have the most accurate values =
possible.

Thank you for the clarification.

Ruixin,

These tables are without BS filtering. The power of the individual clusters i=
n these tables match the powers in Tables 7.7.1-1 and Table 7.7.1-3 of 38.901.

Hi Thorsten,

Thank you very much for sharing the channel model tables. Just a clarificatio=

Dear NR MIMO OTA=E2=80=99ers,

As discussed last week and as captured in the WF

  *   Companies to share the resulting channel model table in the NR MIMO OTA=
 reflector before next RAN4 meeting. Suggested order is CDL-A with UMi and CD=
L-C with UMa for FR1.
Keysight would like to share the scaled channel model table (without the dith=

Any feedback would be appreciated

Hi Thorsten, and all

=20

Thanks for your feedback. The scaled channel model is the first thing we need=
 to align next meeting. Furthermore, in my understanding, the spatial correla=
tion curve, RMS error and system layout discussion should be based on the mod=
el with BS filtering. So I am wondering if it is possible for CE vendors to s=
hare the Channel model tables with BS pattern filtering.

All,

As per Spirent's action item on channel model modification for the WF, please=
 find below the proposed text:

CE vendors and other interested parties will propose AoDs/ZoDs rotations and =
scaling to CDL-A and CDL-C using the methods in 38.901 (section 7.7.5.1) to m=
ake them fit the median values in 38.901 Table 7.5-6 for the accepted scenari=
os.

Please let me know if you have any comments/proposals/modifications.

Regards,
Alfonso
