{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Wooden chest** at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- **Burner inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5)\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone furnace** at position (52.0, -79.0)\n- **Wooden chest** at position (53.5, -78.5)\n- **Burner inserter** at position (54.5, -78.5)\n- **Burner inserter** at position (55.5, -78.5)\n- **Wooden chest** at position (56.5, -78.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing a wooden chest without having it in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required item (wooden chest) in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n#### Errors when crafting a wooden chest without having the required raw resource (wood)\n- Gather the necessary raw resources (wood) before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n#### Errors when placing a wooden chest on an occupied tile\n- Check if the target tile is empty before placing an entity. Remove any existing entity if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when the furnace is not working due to lack of ingredients\n- Ensure the furnace has both the required fuel (coal) and the raw materials (iron ore) to start smelting.\n\n#### Errors when checking for iron plates in the output chest\n- Verify that the furnace has completed smelting and that the output chest is correctly connected to receive the smelted items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **place_entity(Prototype, position)**: Used to place entities on the map. Fails if the entity is not in inventory or the target position is occupied.\n- **craft_item(Prototype, quantity)**: Used to craft items. Fails if the required raw resources are not available.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **new_chest_pos**: Position where the wooden chest is intended to be placed.\n- **furnace**: Represents the stone furnace entity at position (52.0, -79.0).\n- **output_chest**: Represents the wooden chest intended to store smelted items."}
