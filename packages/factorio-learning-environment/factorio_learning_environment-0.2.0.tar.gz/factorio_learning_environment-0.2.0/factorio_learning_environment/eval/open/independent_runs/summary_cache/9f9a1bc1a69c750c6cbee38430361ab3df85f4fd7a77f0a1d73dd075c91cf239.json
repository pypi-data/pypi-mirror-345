{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0)\nThis facility is responsible for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Furnace 1**: Located at position (-15.0, -48.0), currently has a status of `NO_INGREDIENTS` due to lack of input materials.\n- **Furnace 2**: Located at position (-13.0, -48.0), also with a status of `NO_INGREDIENTS`.\n- **Furnace 3**: Located at position (-11.0, -48.0), similarly with a status of `NO_INGREDIENTS`.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nThis setup is used for mining iron ore and consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: Positioned at (4.0, -60.0), currently not operational due to `NO_FUEL` and a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chests**: Positioned at (4.5, -58.5), (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (9.5, -60.5) for storage purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Ensure Fuel Supply for Burner Mining Drill\n- The burner mining drill is repeatedly encountering a `NO_FUEL` status. Ensure that there is a consistent supply of fuel to keep the drill operational.\n\n### Manage Chest Capacity\n- The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is frequently full, halting mining operations. Regularly check and empty the chest to maintain continuous mining.\n\n### Maintain Ingredient Supply for Furnaces\n- The furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) are often in `NO_INGREDIENTS` status. Ensure a steady supply of iron ore to keep the smelting process active.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n  - `iron-ore`: int = 24\n  - `iron-plate`: int = 3045\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int = 4\n\nThe agent should focus on addressing the fuel and ingredient supply issues to optimize the production processes."}
