{"content": "The issue seems to be that the furnace is not producing copper plates, likely due to a lack of coal. Let's ensure that the furnace has enough coal to operate and process the copper ore.\n\n# Step 1: Verify and Insert Coal into the Furnace\n\n1. **Check Current Inventory**: Make sure you have enough coal in your global inventory to supply the furnace.\n2. **Insert Coal**: If the furnace is lacking coal, insert the necessary amount.\n\n```python\n# Recheck the furnace and global inventory\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nglobal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n\n# Calculate how much coal is needed\ncoal_needed = max(0, 5 - furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0))\n\n# Insert coal if available in the global inventory\nif coal_needed > 0 and global_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) >= coal_needed:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=coal_needed)\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough coal available in the global inventory to supply the furnace.\")\n```\n\n# Step 2: Allow Time for the Furnace to Process\n\n```python\n# Allow the furnace time to process the copper ore into copper plates\nsleep(10)\n```\n\n# Step 3: Check Furnace Inventory Again\n\n```python\n# Check the furnace inventory after allowing time for processing\nfurnace_inventory_after = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nprint(\"Furnace inventory after processing: \", furnace_inventory_after)\n\n# Attempt to extract copper plates if they are available\ncopper_plates = furnace_inventory_after.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\nif copper_plates > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, furnace.position, copper_plates)\nelse:\n    print(\"Copper plates were not produced. Ensure the furnace has enough coal and copper ore.\")\n```\n\n# Step 4: Craft Copper Cables and Small Electric Poles\n\n```python\n# Craft copper cables if copper plates are available\nif copper_plates > 0:\n    craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable)\n\n# Attempt to craft small electric poles\ncrafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nassert crafted_poles > 0, \"Failed to craft the small electric pole.\"\n\n# Step 5: Place the Electric Pole\n\ntry:\n    pole_position = Position(x=4.0, y=3.0)\n    electric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, pole_position)\n    assert electric_pole, \"Error in placing the electric pole.\"\n    print(\"Electric pole successfully placed, completing the power network.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Encountered error during placing the electric pole: {e}\")\n```\n\n**Key Tips:**\n- Ensure that the furnace has both coal and copper ore to produce copper plates.\n- Always check the global inventory to confirm resource availability before attempting to insert items into entities.\n- Allow sufficient time for processing in the furnace before checking the inventory again.\n- Verify that the furnace is not blocked by other items or conditions that might prevent smelting.", "summary_range": "[1-144]"}
