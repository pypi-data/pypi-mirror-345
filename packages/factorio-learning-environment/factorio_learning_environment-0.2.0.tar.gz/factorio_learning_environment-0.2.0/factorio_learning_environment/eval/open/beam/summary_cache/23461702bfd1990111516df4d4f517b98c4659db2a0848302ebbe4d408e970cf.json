This would ensure that resources are generated properly and allow for the initiation of factory operations.\n\n# If you have the capability to reset or refresh the game environment, please proceed with that action. Alternatively, if there are any specific commands or instructions you would like me to try, please let me know, and I will do my best to assist!
