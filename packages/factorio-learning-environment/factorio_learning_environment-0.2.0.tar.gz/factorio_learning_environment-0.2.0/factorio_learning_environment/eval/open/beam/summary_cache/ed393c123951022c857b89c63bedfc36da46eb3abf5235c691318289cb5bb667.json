{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Fueled by coal and actively working.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5): Feeds iron ore into the stone furnace. Fueled by coal and operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-2.5, 0.5): Collects iron plates from the burner inserter. Currently contains iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (2.0, 0.0): Used for smelting copper ore into copper plates. Fueled by coal and actively working.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore. Fueled by coal and operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -51.5): Collects iron ore from the burner mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -51.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to a designated output position.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, attempting to place a burner mining drill without having one in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an entity that does not contain them\n- Verify that the entity contains the desired items before attempting to extract them. An error occurred when trying to extract iron plates from the furnace when none were available.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Confirm that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For instance, trying to insert coal into a burner mining drill without having coal in the inventory led to an error.\n\n### Errors when using uninitialized or incorrect API calls\n- Ensure that all API calls are correctly initialized and that the objects being manipulated are valid. An error was encountered when attempting to connect entities with an uninitialized or incorrect attribute.\n\n### Errors when furnace is not producing iron plates\n- Ensure that the furnace is adequately supplied with both fuel and iron ore to maintain continuous production of iron plates. An error was encountered when the furnace was not producing iron plates due to insufficient iron ore.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources\n- Ensure that all necessary resources are available before attempting to craft items. An error occurred when trying to craft a burner mining drill without having the required stone, which is needed to craft a stone furnace, a sub-ingredient for the burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors when crafting copper cables without copper plates\n- Ensure that copper plates are available before attempting to craft copper cables. An error occurred when trying to craft copper cables without having the required copper plates.\n\n### Errors when furnace is not producing copper plates\n- Ensure that the furnace is adequately supplied with copper ore to maintain continuous production of copper plates. An error was encountered when the furnace was not producing copper plates due to insufficient copper ore.\n\n### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ores to prevent them from being idle. Both the iron and copper furnaces encountered a status of \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" due to a lack of iron ore and copper ore, respectively.\n\n### Errors with inserter being out of fuel and waiting for space\n- Ensure that inserters are fueled and that there is space in the destination for items to be transferred. The inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5) was out of fuel and waiting for space in the destination, indicating a blockage in the output path."}
