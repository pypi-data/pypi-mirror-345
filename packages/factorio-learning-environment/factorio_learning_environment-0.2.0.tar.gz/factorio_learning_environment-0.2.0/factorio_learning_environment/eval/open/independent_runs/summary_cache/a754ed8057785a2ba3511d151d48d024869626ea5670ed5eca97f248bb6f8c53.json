{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) which is currently out of fuel.\n- Two Stone Furnaces:\n  - Furnace 1 at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a full output of iron plates.\n  - Furnace 2 at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with a full output of iron plates.\n- Two Burner Inserters:\n  - Inserter 1 at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) waiting for source items.\n  - Inserter 2 at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chests:\n  - Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) with no inventory.\n  - Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing coal.\n  - Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) containing coal.\n- BeltGroup:\n  - Belt from (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5) moving coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. Check the supply lines and ensure that the source entities are operational.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces having full output\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces to ensure continuous production. Consider using inserters to automate the removal of finished products.\n\n### Errors due to mining drills running out of fuel\n- Monitor the fuel levels of mining drills and refuel them regularly to prevent production halts. Consider automating the refueling process using inserters and chests."}
