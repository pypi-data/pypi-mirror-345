{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully built on the map. Although the agent repeatedly attempted to craft and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, all attempts failed due to missing items and resource shortages. The agent did reference two furnaces used for smelting operations\u2014an alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) for iron plate production and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper plate production\u2014but these were retrieved as pre\u2010existing utilities rather than newly created structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities Usage Errors\n  \u2013 When retrieving entities, use the correct function signature. Do not supply unsupported keyword arguments (for example, avoid using \u201cradius\u201d if not accepted) or extra positional parameters.\n\n\u2022 Iteration on Entity Results\n  \u2013 Always verify that the result from an entity retrieval call is not None before iterating over it to avoid TypeErrors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n  \u2013 Confirm that the lab item is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  \u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels and electronic-circuit components synthesized from copper-cables and copper-plates) are available prior to initiating Lab crafting.\n  \u2013 Reinforce resource acquisition and smelting procedures to meet the complete chain of dependencies needed for Lab production."}
