"""
This script contains a unit test function to test the behavior of the remove_from_sprint method in a client class. It
mocks the _request method to raise a RemoveFromSprintError exception with a specified message. The test checks if the
exception is properly raised when calling the remove_from_sprint method with a specific parameter. It also captures the
output to verify that the expected error message is printed.

Functions:
- test_remove_from_sprint_error: Mocks the _request method to raise a RemoveFromSprintError exception when called with
the argument "fail". It takes capsys (a fixture provided by pytest to capture stdout and stderr output) and client (an
object representing a client used to make requests) as parameters.
