{"content": "The error indicates that you have more iron plates than needed, which is why the calculation for `plates_needed` resulted in a negative value. This means you already have enough iron plates to craft the steam engine. Let's proceed directly to crafting the steam engine.\n\nHere's how you can adjust the script:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check current iron plates in inventory\ncurrent_iron_plates = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\nprint(f\"Total iron plates available: {current_iron_plates}\")\n\n# Step 2: Verify if we have enough iron plates\nrequired_iron_plates_for_steam_engine = 10  # Define the required number of iron plates\n\nif current_iron_plates >= required_iron_plates_for_steam_engine:\n    # Step 3: Attempt to craft the steam engine\n    steam_engine_crafted = craft_item(Prototype.SteamEngine)\n    assert steam_engine_crafted > 0, \"Failed to craft the Steam Engine. Check for other missing components or errors.\"\n    print(\"Steam Engine successfully crafted.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Insufficient iron plates. You need {required_iron_plates_for_steam_engine - current_iron_plates} more.\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Check Inventory First**: Always verify your current inventory before deciding to gather more resources.\n- **Avoid Negative Values**: Ensure calculations for needed resources don't result in negative numbers by checking if you already have enough.\n- **Direct Crafting**: If resources are sufficient, proceed directly to crafting without unnecessary resource gathering or processing.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient use of resources and avoids unnecessary operations.", "summary_range": "[1-204]"}
