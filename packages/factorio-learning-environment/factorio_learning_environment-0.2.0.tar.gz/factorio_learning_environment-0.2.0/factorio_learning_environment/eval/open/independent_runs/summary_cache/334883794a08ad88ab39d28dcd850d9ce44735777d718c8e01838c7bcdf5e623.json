{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Initial Iron Smelting Area at (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces used for initial iron plate production:\n- First furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Second furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Automated Iron Mining & Smelting System at (-18.0, -49.0) and (-15.0, -50.0)\nTwo complete mining setups:\n\nFirst Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -49.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-16.5, -47.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-15.5, -47.5) containing iron ore and plates\n\nSecond Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-13.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-12.5, -48.5) containing iron ore and plates\n\n### Copper Mining and Processing System\nMining Setup:\n- Two burner mining drills at (-28.0, -61.0) and (-28.0, -63.0)\n- Mining inserters at (-25.5, -60.5) and (-25.5, -62.5)\n\nSmelting Setup:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-27.0, -56.0) and (-27.0, -53.0)\n- Output inserters at (-25.5, -55.5) and (-25.5, -52.5)\n- Output chests at (-24.5, -55.5) and (-24.5, -52.5) containing copper plates\n\nTransport System:\n- Direct transport belt paths connecting mining inserters to furnaces\n- Simplified parallel transport lines for ore movement\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a position\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities, especially for inserters\n- When rebuilding systems, completely clean up old entities first\n\n### Code-Related Errors\n- Import and define required classes (BurnerMiningDrill, etc.) before using them\n- Initialize variables before accessing their attributes\n- Handle null/None values properly before accessing their properties\n\n### Resource Management\n- Check inventory capacity before inserting items\n- Verify fuel levels in burner entities\n- Handle \"inventory full\" scenarios when inserting fuel\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Verify belt positions exist before attempting pickup\n- Ensure proper cleanup of old belt systems before rebuilding\n- Create complete belt paths with proper connections\n\n### Entity Positioning\n- Use exact drop positions for inserters relative to mining drills\n- Consider entity dimensions when placing adjacent structures\n- Leave sufficient space between parallel production lines\n\n### System Design\n- Implement proper error handling for entity cleanup operations\n- Verify entity positions are valid before attempting operations\n- Monitor system status for blockages and efficiency issues"}
