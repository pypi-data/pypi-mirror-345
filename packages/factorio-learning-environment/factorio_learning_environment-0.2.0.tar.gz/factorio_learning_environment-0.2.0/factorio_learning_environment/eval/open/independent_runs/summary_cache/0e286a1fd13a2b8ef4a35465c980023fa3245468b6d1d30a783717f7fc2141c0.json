{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System\nLocated around position (-80.0):\n- Two furnaces at (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0), both fueled with 50 coal each\n- Two burner inserters at (44.5, -81.5) and (46.5, -81.5)\n- Belt group system containing:\n  - First belt: 21 coal\n  - Second belt: 4 coal\n  - Third belt: 1 iron ore and 1 coal\n  - Fourth belt: empty\n\nThe system appears to be set up for iron smelting with automated fuel and material handling, though currently not actively processing (furnaces show NO_INGREDIENTS status).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing inserters - multiple attempts failed due to existing objects or terrain constraints\n- When placing inserters near furnaces, verify the exact positioning to avoid conflicts with existing structures\n- Use proper coordinate calculations to avoid placing entities on top of each other\n\n### Inserter Orientation Issues\n- Multiple attempts were made to correct inserter orientations showing trial and error\n- Establish clear orientation requirements before placement (north/south/up/down)\n- Consider the entire material flow when determining inserter orientation\n- Verify pickup and drop positions align with intended material flow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- input_inserter1: Entity (burner-inserter)\n- input_inserter2: Entity (burner-inserter)\n\n### Functions\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  - Success: When placement coordinates are clear\n  - Failure: When target location is occupied or invalid\n\n### System States\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Furnace state when empty\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Inserter state when no items to pick up"}
