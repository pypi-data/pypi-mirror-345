{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Small electric pole (position x=3.5, y=6.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the components\n\nThe power generation system is set up but currently not functioning properly. The boiler is out of fuel and the steam engine is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 (position x=15.5, y=70.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 (position x=18.5, y=70.5)\n- Electric mining drill 3 (position x=21.5, y=70.5)\n- Transport belt system (from position x=18.5, y=72.5 to x=26.5, y=72.5)\n\nThe mining drills are placed on iron ore deposits but are not receiving electricity.\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at position(28.0, 73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 (position x=28.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 2 (position x=30.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 3 (position x=32.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 4 (position x=34.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 5 (position x=36.0, y=73.0)\n- Stone furnace 6 (position x=38.0, y=73.0)\n\nAll furnaces have coal fuel but are not receiving iron ore to smelt.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at position(-55.5, 79.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 (position x=-55.5, y=79.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 (position x=-52.5, y=79.5)\n- Electric mining drill 3 (position x=-49.5, y=79.5)\n- Transport belt system (from position x=-55.5, y=81.5 to x=-53.5, y=81.5)\n- Transport belt system (from position x=-49.5, y=81.5 to x=-44.5, y=81.5)\n\nThe mining drills are placed on copper ore deposits but are not receiving electricity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where something is already in the way\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is clear of other entities or terrain obstacles like water\n- Use the map view to identify suitable locations for placement\n- When placing a series of connected entities, ensure there's enough clear space for the entire setup\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with belts\n- Ensure there is a valid path between the start and end points when connecting with transport belts\n- The path might be too long or blocked by obstacles\n- Consider using underground belts to navigate around obstacles\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Make sure to connect all electrical entities to the power network using electric poles\n- Place electric poles within connection range of each other to create a continuous power network\n- Ensure the power generation system (steam engine) is properly set up and fueled\n\n### Errors with production chains\n- When setting up production lines, ensure proper connections between miners, belts, and furnaces\n- Use inserters to move items from belts to furnaces and from furnaces to output belts\n- Make sure all components of a production chain are properly powered"}
