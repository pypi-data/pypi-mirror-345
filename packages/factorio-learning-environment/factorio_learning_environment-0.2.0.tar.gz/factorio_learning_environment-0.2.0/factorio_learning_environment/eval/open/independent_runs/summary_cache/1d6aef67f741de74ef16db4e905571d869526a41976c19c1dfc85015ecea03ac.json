{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-7.0,22.5)\n- **Boiler** at (-7.0,22.5) - Fuel level critical (9/50)\n- **Steam engine** at (-3.5,22.5) - Currently disconnected from boiler\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Water input stable\n- **Steam pipe network** - 6 pipes (currently disconnected between boiler and engine)\n- **Fuel supply system**:\n  - Coal chest at (-6.5,19.5) - Contains 91 coal\n  - Burner inserter at (-6.5,20.5) - Operational but not transferring fuel\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Operational when powered\n- **Storage tank** at (21.5,40.5) - Contains 39.55 crude oil\n- **Oil pipe network** - 3 pipes connecting pumpjack to storage\n\n### Oil Refinery Complex at (25.5,40.5)\n- **Oil refinery** at (25.5,40.5) - Configured for basic oil processing but not receiving crude oil\n- **Power connection** - Connected via 30 small electric poles\n- **Fluid connections** - Input connection point at (26.5,43.5) not linked to storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical System Failures\n1. **Power system collapse** (occurred 3 times)\n   - Complete power loss due to fuel depletion and disconnections\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement automated fuel monitoring with alerts\n     - Create redundant power connections\n     - Maintain minimum fuel buffer in chests\n\n2. **Fluid connection errors** (occurred 4 times)\n   - Failed to connect refinery due to empty source or missing recipe\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify fluid presence before connecting\n     - Set recipes before making connections\n     - Implement connection validation checks\n\n3. **Entity placement conflicts** (occurred 2 times)\n   - Failed to place backup boiler due to existing pipes\n   - Solution:\n     - Check target positions before placement\n     - Implement collision detection\n     - Plan expansion areas in advance\n\n4. **Inventory management issues** (occurred 3 times)\n   - Failed to refuel boiler due to empty inventory\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement inventory tracking\n     - Create emergency fuel reserves\n     - Automate fuel transfers\n\n### Previous Recommendations Still Valid\n1. Maintain complete system documentation\n2. Implement staged activation procedures\n3. Create isolation procedures for failures\n4. Monitor pipe network integrity\n5. Document all automated systems\n\n### New Critical Issues\n1. **Steam system disconnection**\n   - Boiler and engine not properly linked\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify all pipe connections\n     - Implement connection testing\n     - Create visual indicators for critical links\n\n2. **Refinery configuration problems**\n   - Recipe set but not processing\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify fluid inputs\n     - Check power supply\n     - Monitor production status\n\n3. **Unstable power network**\n   - Frequent collapses under load\n   - Solution:\n     - Upgrade power infrastructure\n     - Add backup generators\n     - Implement load balancing"}
