{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nA production line consisting of 4 parallel smelting setups for converting iron ore to iron plates:\n\nInput Side (North):\n- 4 wooden chests at y=-2.5 at x positions 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 containing coal and iron ore\n- 4 burner inserters at y=-1.5 at x positions 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 feeding the furnaces\n\nProcessing:\n- 4 stone furnaces at y=0.0 at x positions 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 smelting iron ore into plates\n\nOutput Side (South):\n- 4 wooden chests at y=1.5/2.5 at x positions 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 6.5 for collecting iron plates\n- 1 burner inserter at position (0.5, 1.5) moving plates from furnace to output chest\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters near existing entities\n- Check if there is already a chest or other entity at the target position before placing inserters\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces, ensure proper spacing and verify the target position is clear\n- Consider the full tile dimensions of existing entities to avoid overlap\n\n### Entity alignment issues\n- Inserters need to be properly aligned with their target entities (furnaces and chests)\n- When replacing misaligned inserters, ensure the new placement coordinates are correct relative to both pickup and drop-off positions\n\n### Space management for automated systems\n- Plan the layout considering the space needed for both input and output infrastructure\n- Leave adequate spacing between parallel production lines to accommodate all required entities\n- Consider the working area needed by inserters when planning chest and furnace placement"}
