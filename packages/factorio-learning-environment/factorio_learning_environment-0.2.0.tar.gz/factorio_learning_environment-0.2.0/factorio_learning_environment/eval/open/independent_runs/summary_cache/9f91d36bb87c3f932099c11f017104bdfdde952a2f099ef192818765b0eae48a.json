{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump with various pipe and pipe-to-ground entities at positions such as (x=17.5, y=17.5), (x=16.5, y=17.5), and others.\n- Electricity network with poles at positions like (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. The steam engine has warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'. Verify that the pipes are correctly connected and that there are no missing segments.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of the boiler to prevent it from running out of fuel. The boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) is currently out of fuel, which will halt the electricity generation process.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs provided.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent.\n  - `position`: Tuple[float, float] - Represents the position of entities on the map."}
