{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple PipeGroups with various positions indicating a complex network, including positions like (-42.5, -124.5), (-50.5, -122.5), and (-68.5, -94.5) among others.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions such as (-61.5, -112.5), (-57.5, -112.5), and others, forming a network to distribute electricity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source via pipes. Check for any disconnections or missing pipes in the network.\n\n### Errors Handling Pipes\n- Verify the existence of pipes at specified positions before attempting operations. Use the correct API to handle pipes and ensure they are placed correctly on the map.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Connect the steam engine to the power network using electric poles. Ensure that all connections are complete and that the steam engine is receiving water and fuel.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole. Check the electricity network for any disconnections or issues with power supply.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to prevent interruptions in mining activities."}
