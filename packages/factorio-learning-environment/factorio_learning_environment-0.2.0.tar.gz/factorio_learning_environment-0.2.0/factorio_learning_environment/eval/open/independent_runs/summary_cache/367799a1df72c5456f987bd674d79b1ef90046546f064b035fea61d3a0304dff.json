{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map during these steps. Multiple attempts were made to place a Lab at position (0.5, y=2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but all such attempts failed because the Lab was not available in the inventory. Although existing furnaces were used for smelting (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)), no new structure was created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage for get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Do not pass unsupported keyword arguments (such as 'radius'); adjust the call to match the function\u2019s expected parameters.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure the number and type of arguments (positional or otherwise) adhere to the function signature.\n\u2003\u2013 Handle cases where get_entities might return None by falling back to an empty list to avoid iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting:\n\u2003\u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), verify that a Lab is available in the inventory.\n\u2003\u2013 Check that all required sub-ingredients for Lab crafting (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available and that their production chains are functional.\n\u2003\u2013 Implement precondition checks to prevent errors such as iterating over a NoneType when filtering for existing Labs.\n\n\u2022 Resource and Production Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate the complete resource availability and intermediate production (e.g., obtaining sufficient iron plates and copper plates) before reattempting complex crafts.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that any shortfall in necessary ingredients is addressed in the production chain to prevent repeated crafting failures."}
