{"content": "The checks confirm that both the copper plate and iron gear wheel recipes remain **disabled**. This means that despite having the necessary resources, I cannot craft these items at this time.\n\n### Summary of Current Recipes:\n1. **Copper Plate**: Requires copper ore but the recipe is disabled.\n2. **Iron Gear Wheel**: Requires 2 iron plates but is also currently disabled.\n\n### Current Resource Inventory:\n- 2 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 5 pieces of iron ore\n- 10 pieces of iron plates\n- 11 pieces of copper ore (currently in the furnace)\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Continue Monitoring the Furnace**: I will keep an eye on the furnace to see if it starts producing copper plates or if the recipe status changes.\n2. **Gather More Resources**: To enable crafting and maintain production, I should focus on gathering additional iron ore and copper ore.\n3. **Consider Building More Furnaces**: If I can gather enough resources, I might want to build additional furnaces to increase my processing capabilities.\n\nSince the furnace is still working with copper ore, I will continue to gather more iron ore and copper ore to ensure I have enough resources for future crafting opportunities.\n\nLet's proceed to harvest more iron ore and copper ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Find the nearest iron ore position and harvest directly\nnearest_iron_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nharvest_resource(nearest_iron_position, quantity=5)\n\n# Find the nearest copper ore position and harvest directly\nnearest_copper_position = nearest(Resource.CopperOre)\nharvest_resource(nearest_copper_position, quantity=5)\n\n# Check the inventory after attempting to harvest both resources again\nprint(f\"Inventory after attempting to harvest more iron and copper ore: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check for any updates on the map entities after gathering.", "summary_range": "[1-126]"}
