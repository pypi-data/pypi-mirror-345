{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5), and steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel, and the steam engine is not connected to a power network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) that is currently not engaged in any research.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) that is not receiving electricity and cannot create automation-science-pack due to missing resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to boiler fuel\n- Ensure to have coal or another fuel type in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the boiler.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Make sure to position pipes correctly to connect entities. Check the coordinates of the entities to ensure they are within the connection range.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
