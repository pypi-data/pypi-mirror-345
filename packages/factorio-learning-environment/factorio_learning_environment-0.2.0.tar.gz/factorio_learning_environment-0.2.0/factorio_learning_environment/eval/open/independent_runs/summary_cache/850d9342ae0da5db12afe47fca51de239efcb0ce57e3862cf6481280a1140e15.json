{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (0,0) to (6,4)\nConsists of four furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0,0) - producing iron plates\n- Stone furnace at (2,0) - producing iron plates\n- Stone furnace at (4,4) - producing iron plates\n- Stone furnace at (6,4) - producing iron plates\n\n### Copper Smelting Area at (0,4) to (2,4)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0,4) - producing copper plates\n- Stone furnace at (2,4) - producing copper plates\n\n### Research Lab at (8.5,0.5)\nSingle lab structure loaded with automation science packs, currently without power\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,19.5) to (-9.5,24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,24.5)\n- Boiler at (-9.5,23.0)\n- Steam engine at (-9.5,19.5)\nCurrently not operational due to missing pipe connections\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to insert items into furnaces\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to place structures\n\n### Crafting System Errors\n- Complex items like labs require a complete crafting chain - ensure all prerequisites can be crafted first\n- For items requiring smelting (like copper plates), ensure they are processed in furnaces rather than trying to craft them directly\n\n### Structure Placement Errors\n- When placing steam engines, ensure the terrain is suitable and there are no obstacles\n- Check terrain compatibility before placing structures (especially near water)\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Power generation system components need proper connections with pipes\n- Ensure correct connection methods are used when linking fluid-carrying structures\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Building box dimensions should be handled with proper numeric values instead of model attributes\n- When connecting entities, ensure the correct connection type is specified and entities are properly aligned\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Structures requiring power need to be properly connected to a power network\n- Ensure power generation system is completely set up with all required connections before expecting power output"}
