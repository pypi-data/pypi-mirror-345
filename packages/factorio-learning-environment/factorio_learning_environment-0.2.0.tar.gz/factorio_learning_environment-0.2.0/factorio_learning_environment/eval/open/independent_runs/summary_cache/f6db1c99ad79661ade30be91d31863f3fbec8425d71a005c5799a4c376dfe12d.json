A full inventory can prevent picking up items or harvesting resources, leading to operational delays.\n\n### Errors when adjusting inserters\n- Verify the presence of the target entity before attempting to adjust it. Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position to avoid errors related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the belt system\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the belt system.
