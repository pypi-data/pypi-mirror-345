{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone mine at position(-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-45.5, y=1.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=1.5) that moves stone from the chest to the furnace at position(-45.0, y=3.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-45.0, y=3.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=4.5) that moves stone bricks from the furnace to the chest at position(-44.5, y=5.5)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-44.5, y=5.5)\n\n#### Stone brick factory at position(-43.5, y=7.5)\nConsists of \n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=-43.5, y=7.5)\n- Small electric pole (position x=-43.5, y=9.5)\n\n#### Electricity generator at position(-39.5, y=7.0)\nConsists of \n- Boiler (position x=-39.5, y=7.0)\n- Steam engine (position x=-35.5, y=7.5)\n- Offshore pump (position x=-21.5, y=-2.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler (positions x=-23.5 y=-2.5 to x=-41.5, y=6.5, x=-32.5, y=6.5, x=-31.5, y=6.5)\n- Small electric pole (position x=-40.5, y=8.5), (position x=-38.5, y=9.5), (position x=-45.5, y=8.5), (position x=-42.5, y=11.5), (position x=-40.5, y=11.5), (position x=-35.5, y=9.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity\n- Make sure you are within the maximum allowed distance when placing an entity\n\n#### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Verify that an entity of the expected type exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that entities are properly connected (e.g. pipes are connected to the correct entities and electric poles are within range\n\n#### Errors related to power supply\n- The assembling machine and steam engine are not receiving power or not connected to the power network. Ensure that the power poles are correctly connected and that the entities are within the power network\n\n#### Errors related to missing resources\n- The assembling machine is not producing output due to missing resources (e.g. stone-brick. Ensure that the required resources are available in the input inventory\n\n#### Errors related to fluid connections\n- The steam engine is not receiving input liquid. Ensure that the pipe connections are correct and the fluid is present in the connections\n\n#### Errors related to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them (e.g. 'entity' is not defined)\n\n#### New error tips from the latest execution logs\n- The boiler is not properly connected to the steam engine. Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to the steam engine using pipes\n- The steam engine is not connected to the power network. Ensure that the steam engine is connected to the power network\n- When placing pipes or pipe-to-ground, ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent. \nThe following variables have been assigned:\n- None"}
