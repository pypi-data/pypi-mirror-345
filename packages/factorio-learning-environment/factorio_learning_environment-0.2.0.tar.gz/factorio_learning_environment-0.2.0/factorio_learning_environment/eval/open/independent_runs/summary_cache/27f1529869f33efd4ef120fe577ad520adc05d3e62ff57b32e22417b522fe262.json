{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of two furnaces that smelt iron ore into iron plates:\n- Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input\n- Furnace at position(2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input\n\n###Copper Plate Production Line  \nConsists of two furnaces that smelt copper ore into copper plates:\n- Furnace at position(4.0, 4.0) with coal fuel\n- Furnace at position(6.0, 4.0) with coal fuel\n\n###Power Generation System\nSteam-based power generation setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at position(-2.5, 24.0) heating water into steam\n- Steam engine at position(4.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes connecting offshore pump to boiler (fluid system 4257)\n  - Steam pipes connecting boiler to steam engine (fluid system 4258)\n- Electric pole network connecting power to facilities (poles at x=8.5 at y positions 2.5, 6.5, 10.5, 14.5, 18.5 and pole at 6.5, 24.5)\n\n###Research Facility\nLab conducting electronics research using automation science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource insertion errors\n- Check inventory has required resources before attempting to insert into machines\n- Maintain adequate supply of raw materials (copper ore, iron ore, coal) to keep production running\n\n### Power system maintenance\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler and add fuel before it runs out\n- Keep coal reserves available for power generation and furnace operation"}
