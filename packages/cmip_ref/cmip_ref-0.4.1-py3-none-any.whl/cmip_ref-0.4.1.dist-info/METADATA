# REF (Rapid Evaluation Framework)

**Status**: This project is in active development. We expect to be ready for beta releases in Q2 2025.

The Rapid Evaluation Framework(REF) is a set of Python packages that provide the ability to manage the execution of calculations against climate datasets.
The aim is to be able to evaluate climate data against a set of reference data in near-real time as datasets are published,
and to update any produced data and figures as new datasets become available.
This is somewhat analogous to a CI/CD pipeline for climate data.

REF is a community project, and we welcome contributions from anyone.


## Usage

The `ref` package exposes a command line interface (CLI) that can be used to
interact with the
