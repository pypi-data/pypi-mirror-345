{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -47.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) collecting iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the stone furnace to another location.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing object at the target location before attempting to place a new entity. For example, the wooden chest could not be placed at (-14.5, -47.5) due to an existing object.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Verify that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For instance, an error occurred when trying to insert coal into an inserter without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventories\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to inspect exists at the specified coordinates. An error was encountered when attempting to inspect the inventory of a non-existent entity at a given position."}
