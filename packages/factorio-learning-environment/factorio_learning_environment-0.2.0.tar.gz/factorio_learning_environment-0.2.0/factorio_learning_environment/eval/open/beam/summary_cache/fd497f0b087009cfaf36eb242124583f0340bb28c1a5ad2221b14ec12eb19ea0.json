{"content": "Ah, I see the issue now. The iron_pos is a Position object, not a tuple. Let's correct the code:\n\n```python\n# First find iron ore\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Found iron ore at {iron_pos}\")\n\n# Move to iron location\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# Mine some iron ore manually\nharvest_resource(iron_pos, quantity=10)\nprint(\"Harvested iron ore\")\n\n# Place furnace nearby (offset from iron position)\nfurnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=Position(x=iron_pos.x + 2, y=iron_pos.y))\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n# Add iron ore to furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=10)\nprint(\"Added iron ore to furnace\")\n\n# Wait for smelting\nprint(\"Waiting for smelting...\")\nsleep(5)\n\n# Check furnace contents\nfurnace_contents = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace contents: {furnace_contents}\")\n\n# Extract iron plates if they're ready\nif Prototype.IronPlate in furnace_contents:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, quantity=furnace_contents[Prototype.IronPlate])\n    print(\"Extracted iron plates\")\n\n# Check our updated inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inventory}\")\n```\n\nKey learnings:\n1. Position objects have .x and .y attributes that we need to use\n2. We can't use array indexing on Position objects\n3. We should check if items exist in furnace contents before trying to extract them\n4. It's good practice to extract all available items from the furnace", "summary_range": "[1-2186]"}
