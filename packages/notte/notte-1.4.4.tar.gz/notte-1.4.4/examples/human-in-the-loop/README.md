# Agent & Human in the loop (HIL)

Notte allows you to run agents in a human-in-the-loop (HIL) mode. This means that the agent will be able to interact with the user to solve a task.
This examples shows how you can take over to solve complex captchas that are not easily solvable by an agent (yet).

## Setup

Follow the setup instructions in the [README](../README.md).
