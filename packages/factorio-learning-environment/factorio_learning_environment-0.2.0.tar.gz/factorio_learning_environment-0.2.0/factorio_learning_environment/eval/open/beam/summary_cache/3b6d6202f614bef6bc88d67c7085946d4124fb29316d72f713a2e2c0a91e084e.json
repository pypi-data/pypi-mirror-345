{"content": "The error indicates that I am still too far from the target position to place the stone furnace, despite moving to the nearest iron ore position. My current position remains at (0.0, 0.0), while the iron ore position is at (-14.5, 26.5), which is indeed more than the allowed distance of 10.\n\n### Summary of Issues:\n1. **Movement Failure**: The move command did not update my position correctly, leaving me at the origin (0.0, 0.0).\n2. **Placement Error**: Attempting to place the stone furnace at a location that is too far from my current position.\n\n### Tips to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Confirm Position After Movement**: Always check the current position after executing a move command to ensure that the movement was successful.\n2. **Direct Positioning**: If moving to a specific resource, use the coordinates directly instead of relying on the nearest function if the distance is significant.\n3. **Incremental Movement**: If the target position is far, consider moving in smaller increments closer to the target rather than attempting to move directly to a distant position.\n\n### Next Steps:\nI will attempt to move directly to the iron ore position using its coordinates and then check my position afterward to ensure I am close enough to place the furnace.\n\nLet's try moving directly to the iron ore coordinates again:\n```python\nmove_to(Position(x=-14.5, y=26.5))  # Move directly to the iron ore position.\n```", "summary_range": "[1-38]"}
