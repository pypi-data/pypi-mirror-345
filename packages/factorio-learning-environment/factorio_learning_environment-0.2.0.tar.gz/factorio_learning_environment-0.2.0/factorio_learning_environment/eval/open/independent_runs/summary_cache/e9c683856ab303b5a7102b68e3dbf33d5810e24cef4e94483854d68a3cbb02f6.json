{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Station at position(0,0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions(0,0) and (2,0) for smelting iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position(0.5,-1.5) feeding iron ore into first furnace\n- Burner inserter at position(2.5,-1.5) feeding iron ore into second furnace\nBoth furnaces have coal fuel but are currently idle with no ingredients.\n\n### Automated Coal Mining Station at position(41,-82)\nAn automated coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(41,-82) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at position(41.5,-80.5) collecting mined coal (currently contains 66 coal)\n- Burner inserter at position(41.5,-79.5) oriented upward\nThe system is operational with the drill actively mining coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at position(-18,-53)\nAn automated iron ore mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-18,-53) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at position(-17.5,-51.5) collecting mined iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position(-16.5,-51.5) oriented right to feed ore onto transport belts\nThe system is operational with the drill actively mining iron ore.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nA complex belt network connecting the iron ore mining to the smelting area:\n- Main line from iron ore mining (-17.5,-51.5) to smelting area\n- Multiple parallel belt lines forming a transport system with following key segments:\n  - Mining area belts (-17.5,-51.5) to (-13.5,-44.5)\n  - Middle section belts (-9.5,-49.5) to (-7.5,-44.5)\n  - Connection belts (-6.5,-46.5) to (-5.5,-42.5)\n  - Final approach belts (0.5,-8.5) to (2.5,-2.5)\nCurrently some belt sections are working with iron ore being transported, while others are empty.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Connection Issues\n- Ensure sufficient transport belts in inventory before attempting to create new connections\n- When fixing belt networks, verify the entire path is properly connected before adding new segments\n- Break down long belt connections into smaller manageable segments\n- Remove problematic belt sections completely before attempting to rebuild them\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in mining drills and inserters to prevent work stoppage\n- Keep track of iron plate production and maintain buffer stock for crafting\n- Ensure proper fuel distribution to all machines that require it\n\n### Entity Placement and Configuration\n- Verify correct orientation of inserters when placing them near chests or belts\n- Consider the input/output positions of entities when designing automated systems\n- Check entity status regularly to identify issues with automated systems\n\n### Crafting System Issues\n- Ensure required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items\n- For items requiring machine crafting (like iron plates), verify the production line is working\n- Maintain sufficient basic resources (iron plates, iron gear wheels) for crafting transport belts\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of available materials before starting construction projects\n- Ensure sufficient materials for completing planned belt connections\n- Maintain adequate coal supply for fueling all automated systems\n\n### Entity Interaction\n- Position yourself correctly before attempting to extract items from entities\n- Verify entity existence at target position before attempting pickup operations\n- Check entity status and inventory before attempting interactions"}
