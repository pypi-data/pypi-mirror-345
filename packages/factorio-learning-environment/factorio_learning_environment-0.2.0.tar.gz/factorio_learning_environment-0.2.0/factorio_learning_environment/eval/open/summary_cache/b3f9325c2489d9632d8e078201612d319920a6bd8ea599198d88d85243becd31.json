{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore, occasionally full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), fueled and operational, transferring iron plates to chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) and newly placed pole at (17.5, 72.5) connected to power network.\n- Persistent output belt blockage warning at furnace output position affecting mining drill throughput.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and iron plate storage with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, though output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), fueled intermittently, currently sometimes out of fuel causing temporary downtime.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), connected by pipes to boiler, generating power when boiler is fueled.\n- Small electric poles at (-4.5, -0.5), (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles near steam engine and mining area forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network, but boiler fuel supply needs consistent management.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and actively crafting iron gear wheels with iron plates input now supplied.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), receiving assembled iron gear wheels.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational, transferring assembled items into output chest.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5) and (25.5, 77.5) connected to power network.\n- Assembling machine input inventory shows iron plates and iron gear wheels present, indicating active crafting.\n\nThis structure is fully powered and supplied with materials, enabling continuous iron gear wheel production and output handling.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failure to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) due to collision with mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) and water tiles.\n- To avoid these errors, verify tile occupancy and terrain type before placement.\n- Consider increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or selecting alternative nearby positions to find free tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters occasionally wait for source items due to temporary inventory shortages.\n- Maintain steady supply of coal and input materials to prevent inserter stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Initial assembling machine lacked iron plates input, preventing crafting.\n- Recent steps show iron plates being inserted into assembler input chest and directly into assembler, enabling active crafting.\n- Ensure continuous supply of input materials to assembler input chest.\n- Clear output chest regularly to prevent output inventory blockage.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" limiting throughput.\n- Furnace output inventory sometimes full, blocking smelting output.\n- Power network improved with additional poles, but boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) occasionally runs out of fuel causing steam engine downtime.\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items.\n- Ensure boiler is consistently fueled to maintain steam power generation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo new user-defined functions have been defined by the agent in the recent steps."}
