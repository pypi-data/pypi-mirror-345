{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-3.5, 2.5)\nConsists of \n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-7.5, 0.0)\n- Steam engine at position(-3.5, 2.5)\n- Pipe connections between offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Crude oil extraction at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of \n- Pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5)\n\n### Power network\nConsists of \n- Small electric poles connecting steam engine at position(-3.5, 2.5) and pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target location is not occupied by another entity or water before placing. (Step 2: Could not place steam-engine at (-5.5, -0.5))\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of objects\n- Check the type and attributes of objects before accessing them. (Step 4: 'ElectricityGroup' object has no attribute 'electrical_id')\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure valid connections between source and target entities. (Step 6: Did not find any valid connections between offshore pump and boiler)\n\n### Errors when asserting entity status\n- Verify that entities are receiving power or functioning as expected before asserting their status. (Step 5: Pumpjack is still not receiving power)\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `offshore_pump`: OffshorePump object\n- `boiler`: Boiler object\n- `steam_engine`: SteamEngine object\n- `pumpjack`: Pumpjack object\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity(entity_type, position)`: Places an entity of the given type at the specified position.\n    - Success mode: Entity is placed successfully.\n    - Failure mode: Entity cannot be placed due to occupied or invalid position. (Step 2)\n- `connect_entities(entity1, entity2, connection_type)`: Connects two entities with the given connection type.\n    - Success mode: Entities are connected successfully.\n    - Failure mode: No valid connections found between entities.
