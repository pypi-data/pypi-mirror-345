{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line at position(x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 (x=8.5, y=13.5)\n- Copper plate input:\n  - Wooden chest (x=9.5, y=11.5)\n  - Burner inserter (x=8.5, y=11.5)\n- Iron gear wheel input:\n  - Wooden chest (x=9.5, y=10.5)\n  - Burner inserter (x=8.5, y=10.5)\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter (x=10.5, y=13.5)\n  - Wooden chest (x=11.5, y=13.5)\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (x=-4.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler (x=-4.5, y=16.0)\n- Offshore pump (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups (fluid systems 2043, 2044, 2045, 2046, 2048)\n- Electric pole network connecting various entities\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups:\n1. Mining setup at (x=41.0, y=-82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n   - Burner inserter (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\n2. Mining setup at (x=-28.0, y=-61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest (x=-27.5, y=-59.5)\n   - Burner inserter (x=-26.5, y=-59.5)\n   - Stone furnace (x=-25.0, y=-59.0)\n   - Output chest (x=-22.5, y=-58.5)\n\n3. Mining setup at (x=-18.0, y=-53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest (x=-17.5, y=-51.5)\n   - Burner inserter (x=-16.5, y=-51.5)\n   - Stone furnace (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n   - Output chest (x=-12.5, y=-50.5)\n\n### Transport System\nBelt network connecting various components:\n- Belt group running from (x=8.5, y=11.5) to (x=6.5, y=11.5)\n- Continues to (x=1.5, y=16.5) to (x=1.5, y=14.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing entities next to existing structures, ensure there is enough space by:\n  - Increasing the spacing parameter\n  - Changing the placement direction\n  - Adjusting the reference position\n- Check for existing entities (chests, electric poles, transport belts) before attempting to place new entities\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Ensure boilers have fuel to maintain power generation\n- Verify proper connection points for water systems are not blocked\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- Verify all inserters are properly oriented to face their target machines\n- Ensure input/output chests are properly positioned relative to inserters\n- Check that assembling machines have all required ingredients and power\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep boilers fueled to maintain power generation\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills and inserters\n- Ensure proper material flow between mining, smelting, and assembly operations"}
