This error occurred multiple times.\n\n### Errors when extending Transport Belt\n- Verify that the intended position for extending the transport belt is valid and unoccupied to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drill\n- Ensure there is an appropriate sink entity (e.g., chest or belt) to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Inserter Source Item Waiting\n- Check that the source entity for the inserter has available items to pick up, and ensure the destination is not full to avoid waiting status."}
