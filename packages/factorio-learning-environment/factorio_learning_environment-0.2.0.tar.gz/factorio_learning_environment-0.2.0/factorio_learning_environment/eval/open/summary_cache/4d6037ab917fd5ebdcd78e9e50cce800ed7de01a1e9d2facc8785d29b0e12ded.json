{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with frequent full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, with burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) feeding the chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational.\n- Output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation persists despite clearing some inventories.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, though output belt blockage remains unresolved and limits throughput.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working but occasionally out of fuel.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently not connected to power network and lacking input fluid.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure is intended to reliably generate electricity from steam power but currently suffers from power network disconnection and boiler fuel issues.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power network but currently not receiving electricity, with input inventory intermittently filled with iron plates.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty and not storing iron gear wheels.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) placed and fueled with coal, but waiting for source items due to empty output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine input inventory shows iron plates present but output inventory remains empty, indicating no gear wheels produced or extracted.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and output inserter setup but is not producing or outputting gear wheels effectively.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous repeated failures to place small electric poles near steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to existing pole at (0.5, 3.5) remain unresolved.\n- To avoid these errors, always verify tile occupancy before placement and consider adjusting placement parameters such as spacing or direction to find free tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters sometimes wait for source items due to empty input or output inventories.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and ensure source inventories are stocked to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) intermittently receives iron plates but fails to produce or output iron gear wheels.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) remains empty, causing extraction attempts to fail with errors indicating no iron gear wheels present.\n- Inserters feeding the output chest wait for source items due to empty chest.\n- Ensure assembling machine is powered and operational; verify recipe is correctly set and that crafting progress is occurring.\n- Confirm output chest is properly connected and accessible by inserters for extraction.\n- Regularly check assembling machine input and output inventories to detect and resolve crafting stalls.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop"}
