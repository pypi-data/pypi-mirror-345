{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete/Under Construction)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Water pipe system with underground pipes from (-9.5, 23.5) to (-5.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) with coal fuel\n- Steam pipe system from (-2.5, 21.5) to (4.5, 21.5)\n- Steam engine at position (4.5, 24.5)\nThe system is currently not operational due to connection issues.\n\n### Manufacturing Area\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at (23.5, 2.5) configured for inserter production\n- Two burner inserters at (21.5, 2.5) and (25.5, 2.5)\n- Two wooden chests at (20.5, 2.5) and (26.5, 2.5)\n- One chest contains 36 inserters\n\n### Science Production Area\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at (32.5, 5.5) configured for logistic science pack production\n- Multiple labs with various science pack inputs:\n  - Several labs with automation science packs\n  - One lab with 40 logistic science packs\n  - Some labs with mixed automation and logistic science packs\n\n### Smelting Area\nConsists of:\n- Three stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), and (4.0, 4.0)\n- Additional stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nOne furnace contains 42 coal and 5 iron plates in result, another has 50 coal\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Pipe Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing pipes - remove conflicting entities first\n- Ensure pipes are not placed where they overlap with water tiles\n- Verify there is enough space for pipe placement without conflicting with other structures\n\n### Connection Issues\n- Steam and water systems must be properly connected end-to-end\n- Ensure underground pipes are within range of each other\n- Check that pipe segments align properly at connection points\n\n### Resource Management\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting to craft or place entities\n- Keep track of underground pipe count as they are consumed in pairs\n\n### Entity Placement\n- Remove existing entities at target positions before attempting to place new ones\n- Ensure placement locations are clear of obstacles and other entities\n- Check that entity footprints don't overlap with existing structures"}
