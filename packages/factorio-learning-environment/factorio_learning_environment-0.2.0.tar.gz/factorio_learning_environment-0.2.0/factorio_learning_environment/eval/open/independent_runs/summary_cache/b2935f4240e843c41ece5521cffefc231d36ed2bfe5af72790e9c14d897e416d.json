{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Entities\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all entities such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Not Producing Iron Plates\n- Verify that the furnace has both fuel and iron ore to process. Ensure that the inserter is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent it from becoming full. A full chest will halt the mining drill's operation, as it cannot deposit more iron ore.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace is supplied with iron ore to smelt. Check the inserter's alignment and functionality to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore to the furnace."}
