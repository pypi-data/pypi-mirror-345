{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is set up to mine and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore from the ground. It is currently out of fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores the mined iron ore. Currently contains 661 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It has been repositioned multiple times to align correctly with the chest and furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It currently has no ingredients to smelt and contains 2 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source (chest) and destination (furnace) entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring items effectively.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as the burner mining drill and burner inserter to maintain continuous operation. Consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Inserter Fuel Shortages\n- Keep the burner inserter fueled to avoid it running out of fuel, which can halt the transfer of iron ore to the furnace.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to deliver iron ore to the furnace. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, check the inserter setup and ensure it is functioning as intended."}
