A recent attempt to supply power near the lab (via an extra small electric pole at x=-5.5, y=18.5) failed due to spacing conflict; the lab was instead connected through the existing electricity network\u2014linking it to the electric pole at (x=3.5, y=19.5)\u2014although the lab still remains in a NO_POWER state.\n\u2022 Electricity Group comprising:\n\u2003\u2013 Existing small electric poles at (x=-0.5, y=11.5), (x=-7.5, y=15.5), (x=-4.5, y=15.5), (x=3.5, y=19.5) and (x=1.5, y=22.5);\n\u2003\u2013 Additional poles at (x=-7.5, y=16.5) and (x=-8.5, y=13.5);\n\u2003\u2013 Merged network poles at (x=-17.5, y=13.5) and (x=-17.5, y=16.5).\n\u2022 Steam Engines:\n\u2003\u2013 Primary steam engine at (x=-13.5, y=16.5) [NOT_CONNECTED]\n\u2003\u2013 Additional engines at (x=-14.5, y=13.5), (x=7.5, y=35.5) and (x=8.5, y=20.5)\n\u2022 Fluid System Submodule \u2013 Boiler Module:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-existing Boiler at (x=-13.5, y=19.0) [NOT_CONNECTED]\n\u2003\u2013 Intermediate pipe at (x=-17.5, y=21.5) (connection attempt failed)\n\u2003\u2013 New Boiler and Steam Engine Pair:\n\u2003\u2003\u2219 New Boiler originally placed at (x=-14.0, y=16.5) and repositioned to (x=-10.0, y=22.5) [NOT_CONNECTED \u2013 fluid connection unresolved]\n\u2003\u2003\u2219 New Steam Engine at (x=-7.5, y=11.5) [NOT_CONNECTED]\n\u2003\u2013 Fluid and water connections for the new pair remain unresolved.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at position (x=1.5, y=19.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Assembling Machine at (x=1.5, y=19.5) reconfigured for Iron Gear Wheel production.\n\u2022 Burner Inserter at (x=1.5, y=17.5).\n\u2022 Input Chest at (x=2.5, y=17.5).\n\u2022 Output Chest at (x=1.5, y=21.5).\n\u2022 Dedicated Copper Buffer Chest at (x=-5.5, y=21.5).\n\u2022 Dedicated Transport Belt Segment at (x=0.5, y=17.5).\n\u2022 Additional Burner Inserters at (x=2.5, y=16.5) and (x=3.5, y=17.5).\n\n### Copper Extraction System (adjacent to the copper smelting furnace)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Extraction Burner Inserter at (x=-3.5, y=23.5) with pickup at (x=-3.5, y=22.5) and drop at (x=-3.5, y=24.5).\n\u2022 Copper Buffer Chest at (x=-3.5, y=26.5).\n\u2022 Chest Extraction Burner Inserter at (x=-3.5, y=27.5) with pickup at (x=-3.5, y=26.5) and drop at (x=-3.5, y=28.5).\n\u2022 Belt Source Inserter at (x=-3.5, y=25.5).\n\n### Extraction Belt Depot at position (x=3.5, y=15.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Wooden Chest at (x=3.5, y=15.5) serving as the belt depot.\n\u2022 Dedicated Transport Belt Segment at (x=4.5, y=15.5) for copper plate conveyance.\n\u2022 Depot Burner Inserter at (x=3.5, y=14.5) with pickup at (x=3.5, y=15.5) and drop at (x=3.5, y=13.5).\n\n### Belt Connection Target Setup for Copper Extraction\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Extraction Source: Wooden Chest at (x=3.5, y=15.5).\n\u2022 Extraction Inserter at (x=4.5, y=15.5) with pickup at (x=3.5, y=15.5) and drop at (x=5.5, y=15.5).\n\u2022 Manual Transport Belt Chain comprising horizontal segments (e.g. at x=7.5 and x=8.5 along y=15.5) and vertical segments from y=14.5 down to y=11.5 (with noted blockages).\n\u2022 New Target Inserter at (x=8.5, y=9.5) with pickup at (x=8.5, y=10.5) and drop at (x=8.5, y=8.5).\n\u2022 Belt Chain Burner Inserter Refueling Subsystem with burner inserters at various positions.\n\n### Remote Fluid Integration System at remote region (approximate center: x=-30, y=40)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Offshore Pump at (x=-30.5, y=37.5) operating (WORKING).\n\u2022 Boiler for fluid heating at (x=-29.0, y=33.5).\n\u2022 Pipe Connection established via a PipeGroup starting at (x=-30.5, y=31.5) and extending to (x=-30.5, y=34.5).\n\u2022 New segmented pipe connection attempt to link the Offshore Pump with the New Boiler at (x=-10.0, y=22.5) using computed candidate positions:\n\u2003\u2013 Candidate 1 at (x=-25.157818046049, y=34.456940033695): segment from the pump to this candidate failed.\n\u2003\u2013 Candidate 2 at (x=-21.315636092099, y=29.913880067389): segment connecting Candidate 1 to Candidate 2 succeeded, but the subsequent segment from Candidate 2 to the boiler failed.\n\u2022 Overall, the fluid connection between the Offshore Pump and the New Boiler remains unresolved.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Segmented Pipe Connection Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 When establishing segmented pipe links, verify that candidate positions are accurately computed, buildable, and unobstructed. Ensure that connection points on both the source (e.g. Offshore Pump) and target (e.g. New Boiler) are within allowed proximity and have compatible fluid input/output requirements.\n\u2003\u2013 In cases where a segment (such as from the pump to Candidate 1 or from Candidate 2 to the boiler) fails, recheck both the buildability of the target tile and the fluid demands of the receiving entity.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and Research Prerequisites:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all necessary technology prerequisites are unlocked prior to attempting to craft advanced items (for example, storage tanks require Fluid\u2011Handling technology, which in turn mandates completion of Automation\u20112 and Electronics research).\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that the target tile for entity placement\u2014especially for game-critical items such as storage tanks\u2014has no obstructions and is buildable to avoid \u201ccan_place_entity returned False\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Research Progress Delays and Prerequisite Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure prerequisite research (e.g. Electronics for Automation\u20112) is completed before setting new technology goals; missing prerequisites lead to research timeouts.\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor research progress and adjust science pack supply as needed, since insufficient ingredients or prolonged iterations can hinder research completion.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Sub-ingredient Availability:\n\u2003\u2013 When crafting complex items like automation science packs, verify that all required sub-ingredients (for instance, copper-plate) are craftable with available machines (e.g. furnaces or assembling machines). This prevents errors due to missing components.\n\n\u2022 Electric Pole Placement Conflicts:\n\u2003\u2013 Before attempting to place an electric pole (such as to power the Lab), confirm that the target placement tile is not already occupied by another entity. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions as needed to meet placement constraints.\n\n\u2022 Movement & Positioning Constraints (from previous reports):\n\u2003\u2013 Always update the player\u2019s location accurately prior to placement actions. Distance errors can occur if the agent remains erroneously at (0,0) or another default location.\n\u2003\u2013 If an initial placement fails due to distance constraints, ensure proper relocation and allow time for game state updates before reattempting.\n\n\u2022 Boiler Placement and Buildability (from previous reports):\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-check that the placement area for boilers is free of obstructions, water overlaps, or invalid surfaces to avoid repeated \u201ccan_place_entity returned False\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Fluid and Pipe Connection Inventory (from previous reports):\n\u2003\u2013 Before segmented pipe connections, verify that sufficient pipe inventory is on hand. Inventory errors citing insufficient pipes indicate the need to stock additional resources.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that each computed candidate for pipe placement is unobstructed and meets all fluid connection requirements.\n\n\u2022 Entity Retrieval and Repositioning (from previous reports):\n\u2003\u2013 After picking up an entity for repositioning, ensure it is completely removed from the map prior to re-placement to prevent cascading errors.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm successful reinsertion in a clear and accessible tile to maintain proper system connectivity."}
