{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) with status 'NO_INGREDIENTS'\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5) with status 'WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS' and connected to the stone furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) containing iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (-7.5, -49.5) with status 'WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION' and connected to the wooden chest\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup 1: Inputs from (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5), outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5)\n- BeltGroup 2: Inputs from (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5), outputs from (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5)\n- BeltGroup 3: Inputs from (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5), outputs from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5)\n- BeltGroup 4: Inputs from (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-52.5), outputs from (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Non-existent Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from exists and contains the required items before attempting extraction. For example, verify that the wooden chest at (-8.5, -49.5) contains iron ore before extracting.\n\n### Errors Related to Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters have a valid source and destination. The burner inserter at (-7.5, -49.5) is waiting for space in the destination, indicating a blockage. Check the destination entity to ensure it can accept items.\n- Refuel inserters regularly to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations."}
