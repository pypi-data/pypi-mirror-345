{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), working and connected to:\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) with inventory of iron ore.\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) with empty inventory.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) with inventory of iron ore.\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (x=-13.5, y=-49.5) with empty inventory.\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=-18.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0), all working and producing iron plates.\n\n### Coal and Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), working and connected to:\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0), with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - **Iron Chests** at positions (x=41.5, y=-80.5) and (x=42.5, y=-80.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=43.5, y=-80.5) transferring items between chests and the furnace.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=44.5, y=-80.5), (x=45.5, y=-80.5), (x=47.5, y=-80.5), and (x=49.5, y=-80.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from mining drills\n- Ensure the output of the mining drill is clear before attempting to extract. Check if the connected chest is full and empty it if necessary.\n\n### Errors when supplying iron ore to furnaces\n- Verify that you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another object to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when transferring items to specific positions\n- Double-check the target position for the presence of the correct entity type before attempting to transfer items to avoid transfer errors."}
