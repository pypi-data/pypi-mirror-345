In step 1821 the agent retrieved an alternative furnace at this location and used it to insert ore and coal, later extracting 30 iron plates.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\nUsed for transforming copper ore and coal into copper plates. In step 1822 the agent retrieved a copper furnace, inserted 50 copper ore and coal, and then extracted 45 copper plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 When calling the entity\u2010retrieval function:\n  \u2013 Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments.\n  \u2013 Ensure that the function is invoked following its correct signature so that it returns an iterable result rather than None.\n\n\u2022 During Lab placement and crafting:\n  \u2013 Confirm that the required Lab item is available in inventory before attempting to place it.\n  \u2013 Before crafting a Lab, verify that all dependent sub\u2010ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available. Missing ingredients repeatedly lead to crafting failures.\n  \u2013 Guard against iterating over a NoneType object by checking that retrieved entity lists are valid prior to filtering.\n\n\u2022 In resource-dependent operations:\n  \u2013 Ensure that smelting or resource production processes are sufficiently established to meet sub-ingredient requirements for advanced crafting."}
