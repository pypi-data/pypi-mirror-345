{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), fueled by coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), used for storing mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), (x=-11.5, y=-46.5), (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-11.5, y=-45.5), used for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-49.5), (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-7.5, y=-48.5), (x=-5.5, y=-48.5), (x=-4.5, y=-48.5), (x=-3.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), used for storing iron plates and other resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Drop Position Blockage\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked. Regularly check and clear any blockages at drop positions to maintain smooth operation.\n\n### Errors with Extracting Items\n- When extracting items from entities like furnaces, ensure that the entity is not blocked and has enough space. Consider extracting in smaller batches if extraction fails due to space constraints.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly supply source entities with necessary items to avoid idle inserters.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with necessary resources to maintain continuous production."}
