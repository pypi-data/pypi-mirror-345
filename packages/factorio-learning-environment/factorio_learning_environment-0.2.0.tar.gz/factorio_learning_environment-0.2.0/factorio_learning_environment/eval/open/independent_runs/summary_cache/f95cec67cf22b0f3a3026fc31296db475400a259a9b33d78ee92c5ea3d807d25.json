{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. It has a warning of \"output blocked by item on the ground\" and is currently working.\n- **Transport Belt Network**: A complex belt system that connects various positions, including:\n  - Belt from (x=-15.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5) in the DOWN direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-55.5) in the RIGHT direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5) in the UP direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5) in the UP direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) in the DOWN direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-17.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-52.5) in the UP direction.\n- **BeltGroup**: Includes 79 belts with inputs and outputs, currently empty.\n\n### Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. It has a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\" and is currently not processing any items.\n\n### Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-10.5, y=-48.5), status \"waiting for source items\", with a warning of \"out of fuel\".\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-7.5, y=-49.5), status \"waiting for source items\", with a warning of \"out of fuel\".\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-5.5, y=-49.5), status \"waiting for source items\", with a warning of \"out of fuel\".\n\n### Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts to non-belt entities\n- Ensure that belts are connected to other belts or use inserters when connecting to non-belt entities like chests or furnaces.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Define all variables before using them in operations. For example, ensure that 'output_chest' is defined before accessing its properties.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that there are enough items in the inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities. This includes ensuring sufficient coal before refueling operations.\n\n### Errors due to invalid belt paths\n- Check the path for belt connections to ensure they are valid and can be normalized. Adjust the layout if necessary to create a valid path.\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Ensure that operations have sufficient time to complete, and consider increasing wait times if necessary to allow the system to stabilize."}
