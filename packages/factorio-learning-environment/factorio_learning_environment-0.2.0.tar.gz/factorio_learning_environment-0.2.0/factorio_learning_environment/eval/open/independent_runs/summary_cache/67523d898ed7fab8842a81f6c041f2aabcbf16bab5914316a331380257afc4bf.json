(Iron ore is transferred here for smelting; later, 38 iron plates were extracted.)\n\u2022 Stone Furnace for Copper Smelting at (5.0, 0.0) with a Burner Inserter at (3.5, 0.5).\n\u2022 Common Input Chest \u2013 Wooden Chest at (2.5, 0.5) stocking copper-plate.\n\u2022 New Feeder Inserter \u2013 Feeder Inserter at (2.5, -0.5) with pickup at (2.5, -1.5) and drop at (2.5, 0.5).\n\u2022 Dedicated Output Chest for Iron Plates \u2013 Wooden Chest successfully placed at (0.5, 2.5) to deposit extracted iron plates from the furnace.\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection \u2013 BeltGroup linking mining output at (-14.5, -47.5) to the feeder inserter pickup (2.5, -1.5) using 64 belts.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Burner Mining Drill at (-15.0, -50.0) with output drop at (-14.5, -48.5).\n\u2022 Drill Inserter at (-13.5, -47.5) transferring ore.\n\u2022 Sink Chest \u2013 Wooden Chest at (-11.5, -46.5) serving as temporary ore storage.\n\u2022 Sink Inserter \u2013 Burner Inserter at (-10.5, -46.5) with pickup at (-9.5, -46.5) and drop at (-11.5, -46.5); recently refueled with coal (fuel: Inventory({'coal': 9})) and now operating with no warnings.\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection \u2013 BeltGroup connecting the mining drill drop at (-14.5, -48.5) to the sink inserter pickup at (-9.5, -46.5).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Placement Range and Buildability:\n\u2003\u2013 Always move close to the intended placement location and use the nearest_buildable function when direct placement fails.\n\u2022 Undefined Variables and Nil References:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all temporary variables and entity references are correctly initialized to prevent nil indexing.\n\u2022 Occupied Tile Conflicts & Spacing Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 When placement errors occur due to an obstructed tile (e.g. failure to place an output chest adjacent to a furnace due to nearby transport belts or inserters), adjust spacing, change placement direction, or modify the reference position.\n\u2022 Object Attribute and Method Misuse:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid treating non-callable properties as functions. For example, use the center attribute of a buildable_area correctly rather than calling it as a function.\n\u2022 Inventory and Crafting Requirements:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that required items are available in inventory before placement and that necessary technological recipes are unlocked prior to crafting (as seen with the assembling machine placement and crafting errors).\n\u2022 Belt Connection Targeting:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that connections between entities are correctly sequenced by inserting appropriate intermediary entities if direct linking fails.\n\u2022 Fuel Shortages:\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor and replenish fuel on entities (like sink inserters and burner inserters) to maintain continuous operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 shift_entity_local(entity: Entity, offset: Tuple[float, float]) -> Entity  \n\u2003\u2013 Shifts the given entity\u2019s position by the specified offset.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Success: Entity is repositioned correctly.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Failure: Prototype mismatches may occur if identifier strings are not standardized.\n\n\u2022 nearest_buildable(position: Position) -> BoundingBox  \n\u2003\u2013 Determines the nearest buildable area surrounding a given position for entity placement.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Success: Returns a valid bounding box for placement.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Failure: Misuse of property access can trigger errors.\n\n\u2022 place_entity_next_to(prototype: Prototype, reference_position: Position, direction: Direction, spacing: int) -> Optional[Entity]  \n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place an entity of the given prototype adjacent to a reference position based on the specified direction and spacing.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Success: Returns the placed entity if the target cell is buildable and unoccupied.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Failure: Returns an error if the target position is occupied or invalid.\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 furnace_input_chest_pos (Position) \u2013 Holds the position of the furnace input chest.\n\u2022 current_player_inventory (Inventory) \u2013 Tracks the current state of the player\u2019s inventory.\n\u2022 mining_drill_drop (Position) \u2013 Stores the mining drill\u2019s output drop position.\n\u2022 target_chest_position (Position) \u2013 Represents the position of the attempted transport belt connection target."}
