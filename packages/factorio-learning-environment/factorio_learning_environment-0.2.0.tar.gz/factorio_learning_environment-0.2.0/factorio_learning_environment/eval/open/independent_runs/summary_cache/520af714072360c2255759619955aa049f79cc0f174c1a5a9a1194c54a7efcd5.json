Check the inventory of the chest before calling the `extract_item` function.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a mining drill without fuel\n- Ensure the mining drill has fuel before attempting to insert items. Check the fuel status of the mining drill and provide coal if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without fuel or ingredients\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel and the required ingredients before starting the smelting process. Check the furnace's inventory and status to confirm.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full chest\n- Ensure the chest has space before attempting to insert items. Empty the chest or use a different storage solution if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is empty before placing an entity. Check the tile for existing entities or obstacles.\n\n#### Errors when using inserters without source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to source items before attempting to transfer them. Check the inserter's pickup position and the inventory of the source entity."}
