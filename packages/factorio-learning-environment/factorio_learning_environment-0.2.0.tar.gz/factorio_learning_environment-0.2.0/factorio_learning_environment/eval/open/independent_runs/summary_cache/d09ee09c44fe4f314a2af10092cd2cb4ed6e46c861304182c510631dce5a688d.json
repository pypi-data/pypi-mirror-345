{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (4.5, 6.5)\n- Pipe system connecting the offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\n- Coal mining drill at position (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 1.5) that moves coal from drill to transport belt\n- Burner inserter at position (-7.5, 2.5) that feeds coal to boiler\n- Transport belt system connecting coal drill to boiler inserter\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (15.5, 70.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 74.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (15.5, 72.5) that moves ore from drill to furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 75.5) that moves iron plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 76.5) for iron plate storage\n- Small electric poles connecting to power network\n\n### Copper Mining and Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (-46.5, 70.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (-46.0, 74.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (-46.5, 72.5) that moves ore from drill to furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (-45.5, 75.5) that moves copper plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest at position (-45.5, 76.5) for copper plate storage\n- Small electric poles connecting to power network\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (16.5, 80.5) set to produce iron gear wheels\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 78.5) to feed iron plates into assembler\n- Small electric poles connecting to power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to a Boiler or Chest as target/source. Always use an inserter as an intermediary between belts and machines/chests.\n- When connecting entities with belts, make sure the path is clear and no other entities are blocking the way.\n\n### Errors when placing entities near existing structures\n- Check for existing entities (like pipes) before placing new entities in the same position.\n- When placing inserters next to machines, adjust the spacing or direction if the initial placement fails.\n- Use appropriate spacing parameters when placing entities next to others to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors when connecting fluid systems\n- Ensure there is a clear path for pipes between fluid-producing and fluid-consuming entities.\n- Check that connection points between fluid entities are properly aligned and not blocked.\n- When using underground pipes, ensure the placement position is clear of other entities.\n\n### Fuel management issues\n- Remember to add fuel to burner mining drills and other fuel-consuming entities to keep them operational.\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner inserters and mining drills to prevent production stoppages."}
