{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), connected to a wooden chest at (4.5, -58.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Three Stone Furnaces for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently working with iron ore.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently working with iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests for storing iron plates, positioned at:\n  - (-14.5, -50.5)\n  - (-13.5, -50.5)\n  - (-12.5, -50.5)\n  - (-11.5, -50.5) - Full with iron plates\n  - (-10.5, -50.5) - Full with iron plates\n  - (-9.5, -50.5) - Full with iron plates\n  - (-8.5, -50.5) - Full with iron plates\n  - (-7.5, -50.5) - Partially filled with iron plates\n  - (-6.5, -50.5)\n  - Iron Chest at (-6.5, -50.5)\n  - Iron Chest at (-5.5, -50.5) - Partially filled with iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Capacity Management\n- Ensure that chests used for storage are not full to avoid interruptions in mining and production processes. Regularly check and empty chests to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Efficient Resource Allocation\n- Monitor the fuel levels in furnaces to ensure they are adequately supplied for continuous operation. This will prevent downtime and maintain production efficiency.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions or variables were defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
