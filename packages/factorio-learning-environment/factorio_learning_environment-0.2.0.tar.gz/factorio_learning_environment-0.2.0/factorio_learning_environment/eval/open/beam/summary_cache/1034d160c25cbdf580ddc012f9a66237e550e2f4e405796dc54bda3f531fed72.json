{"content": "The error message indicates that the `connect_entities` function is expecting either an `Entity` or a `Position` as its target, but it seems the input provided does not match these expected types. Let's address this issue step by step.\n\n### Analysis and Fixes\n\n1. **Check Entity Definitions:**\n   - Ensure that both `boiler` and `steam_engine` are defined as `Entity` objects. If they are not, you need to make sure they are correctly instantiated or retrieved from the environment.\n\n2. **Correct Usage of `connect_entities`:**\n   - The `connect_entities` function should be used with two `Entity` objects or an `Entity` and a `Position`. Double-check that both `boiler` and `steam_engine` are indeed entities.\n\n3. **Debugging Steps:**\n   - Print the types of `boiler` and `steam_engine` to confirm they are `Entity` objects.\n\n### Revised Code\n\nLet's revise the code to ensure proper connections and add some debugging to verify the types:\n\n```python\n# Debugging: Print types to ensure they are entities\nprint(f\"Type of boiler: {type(boiler)}\")\nprint(f\"Type of steam_engine: {type(steam_engine)}\")\n\n# Attempt to connect the Boiler to the Steam Engine\ntry:\n    assert connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine, Prototype.Pipe), \"Failed to connect Boiler to Steam Engine.\"\n    print(\"Successfully connected Boiler to Steam Engine.\")\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print(f\"TypeError: {e}\")\n    # Additional debugging information\n    print(f\"Boiler: {boiler}, Steam Engine: {steam_engine}\")\n```\n\n### Tips for Success\n\n- **Entity Verification:** Always verify that the variables you are working with are of the expected types, especially when dealing with functions that require specific types.\n- **Error Handling:** Use try-except blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully, providing useful debugging information.\n- **Print Debugging:** Use print statements to output the types and values of variables when debugging issues related to type mismatches.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with connecting the boiler and steam engine. If the problem persists, ensure that the entities are correctly instantiated and that their positions are valid.", "summary_range": "[1-354]"}
