Always insert an appropriate inserter to serve as the interface target.\n\n\u2022 Wooden Chest Placement Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the target placement position is within the allowed distance. Ensure you are sufficiently close to the intended spot and that the required wooden chest is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Variable Naming Mistake  \n\u2003\u2013 Use consistent and correctly defined variable names (for example, use target_place_pos or depot_chest instead of an undefined name like target_chest) to prevent reference errors.\n\n\u2022 Connection Retry Protocol  \n\u2003\u2013 After a failed connection attempt, incorporate a wait period to allow system stabilization before reattempting belt connections."}
