{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled with coal  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal  \n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace, currently out of fuel  \n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine, currently out of fuel and blocked due to no sink entity for output  \n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine, currently out of fuel and waiting for source items  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, currently not receiving power  \n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters, but assembler remains unpowered  \n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and electric poles. However, burner inserters lack fuel and the assembling machine is not powered, causing production to halt. The output inserter is blocked due to no available sink entity for produced items.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to assembler not receiving power  \n- Despite placing and connecting multiple small electric poles, the assembling machine remains without power.  \n- Verify that electric poles form a continuous power network that includes the assembling machine and all inserters.  \n- Check that poles have sufficient coverage and correct placement to connect all entities electrically.  \n- Confirm that the power network has an active power source supplying electricity.  \n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters  \n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into burner inserters fail due to \"No coal to insert from your inventory,\" despite harvesting coal.  \n- Ensure that coal harvested is properly added to the player\u2019s inventory before insertion attempts.  \n- Avoid attempting to insert coal into inserters immediately after harvesting without confirming inventory update.  \n- Track coal quantities accurately to prevent redundant insertion attempts when inventory is empty.  \n\n### Errors related to burner inserters being out of fuel  \n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5) are out of fuel, causing them to stop working.  \n- Insert coal into burner inserters proactively to maintain their operation.  \n- Monitor fuel levels of burner inserters regularly and automate refueling if possible.  \n\n### Errors due to blocked output inserter  \n- The burner inserter at (23.5, 73.5) is blocked because there is no sink entity to accept the output from the assembling machine.  \n- Ensure that the wooden chest at (18.5, 73.5) or another storage entity is correctly positioned and accessible to receive items.  \n- Verify inserter drop positions and belt or chest placement to avoid output blockage.  \n\n### Errors inserting iron ore into furnace  \n- At step 13 and 15, no iron ore was available in inventory to insert into the furnace at (17.0, 73.0).  \n- Confirm that iron ore output from the burner mining drill is properly transferred and not blocked.  \n- Check for output blockages or missing inserters between mining drill and furnace.  \n\n### General placement and inventory management tips  \n- Before inserting items, confirm the inventory contains sufficient quantities.  \n- When placing entities, ensure tiles are free and not occupied by other entities to avoid collisions.  \n- Maintain continuous power network connectivity and verify power availability at all electric entities.  \n- Regularly check fuel levels of burner entities to prevent stoppages.  \n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
