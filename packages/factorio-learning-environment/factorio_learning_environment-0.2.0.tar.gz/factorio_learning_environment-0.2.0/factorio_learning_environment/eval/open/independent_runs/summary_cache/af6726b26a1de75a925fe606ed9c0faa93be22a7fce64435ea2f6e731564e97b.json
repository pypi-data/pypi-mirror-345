{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is free and valid for placing the desired entity. Check the surroundings to avoid overlapping with existing structures.\n\n### Errors when moving Stone Furnace to a new location\n- Verify that the target location for moving the Stone Furnace is clear and suitable for placement. Consider the dimensions and space required for the furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing Transport Belts\n- Confirm that the path for the Transport Belt is clear and that there are no obstacles or invalid tiles along the intended route.\n\n### Errors when connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the start and end positions for connecting Transport Belts are valid and that there is a clear path between them. Avoid attempting connections over occupied or invalid tiles.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Address warnings about output being blocked by ensuring there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or another processing unit) to accept the output from the mining drill.\n\n### No Ingredients Warning in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. Check the input inventory and supply the required resources for smelting."}
