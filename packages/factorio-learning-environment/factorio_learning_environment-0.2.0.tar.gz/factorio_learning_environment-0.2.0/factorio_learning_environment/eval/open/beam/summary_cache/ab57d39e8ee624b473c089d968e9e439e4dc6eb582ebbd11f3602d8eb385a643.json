{"content": "# An error occurred while attempting to harvest iron ore, indicating that there was \"Nothing within reach to harvest.\" \n# This suggests that the agent may not be close enough to the iron ore resource or that the resource is not accessible for harvesting.\n\n## Next Steps:\n1. **Check Proximity**: Ensure that the agent is within the correct range to harvest the iron ore.\n2. **Move Closer**: If the agent is not close enough, we need to move to a position that allows for harvesting.\n\nLet's first check our current position to see if we are indeed close enough to the iron ore. We can use the `get_position()` function to verify our location.\n\n```python\ncurrent_position = get_position()\nprint(f'Current Position: {current_position}')\n```\n\nAfter confirming our position, we can adjust our movement accordingly. If we are not close enough, we will move closer to the iron ore before attempting to harvest again.", "summary_range": "[1-10]"}
