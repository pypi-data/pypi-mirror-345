{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area (around position x=0-2, y=0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces working in parallel:\n  - Furnace 1 at (0,0) producing iron plates from iron ore\n  - Furnace 2 at (2,0) producing iron plates from iron ore\n\n### Steel Production Area (at position x=8, y=0)\n- Single stone furnace for steel production at (8,0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Area (around position x=4-6, y=4)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces working in parallel:\n  - Furnace 3 at (4,4) producing copper plates from copper ore\n  - Furnace 4 at (6,4) producing copper plates from copper ore\n\n### Power Generation System (around position x=-7.5, y=18-25)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-7.5, 18.5)\n- Boiler at (-7.5, 22.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Connected pipe network:\n  - Steam pipes at (-7.5, 15.5)\n  - Water pipes at (-9.5, 22.5)\n  - Additional pipe at (-7.5, 20.5)\n\n### Research Lab Complex\nMultiple labs spread across the map with electricity connections through poles at various positions including (4.5,15.5), (5.5,15.5), (1.5,16.5), (-1.5,18.5), (-3.5,20.5), (7.5,21.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with research prerequisites\n- Ensure all prerequisite technologies are researched before attempting to research advanced technologies\n- Check technology tree dependencies before setting research targets\n- Use correct technology names when setting research (e.g., \"logistics\" vs \"Logistics\")\n\n### Errors with furnace operations\n- Check furnace inventory capacity before attempting to insert materials\n- Clear output products from furnaces regularly to prevent backup\n- When furnace shows \"inventory full\" warning, extract products before adding more materials\n\n### Errors with science pack operations\n- Verify correct science pack names when adding to labs\n- Ensure you have the required science packs in inventory before attempting to add them to labs\n- Check if research is already completed before attempting to restart it\n\n### Errors with item insertion\n- Verify target inventory has space before attempting to insert items\n- Check if the target entity accepts the type of item you're trying to insert\n- Monitor inventory fullness warnings and clear space when needed"}
