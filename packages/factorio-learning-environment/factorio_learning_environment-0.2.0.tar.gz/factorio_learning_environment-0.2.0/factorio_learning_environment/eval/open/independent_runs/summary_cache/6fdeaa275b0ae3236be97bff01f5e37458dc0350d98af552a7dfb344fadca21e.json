{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at x=-9.5 y=-0.5\nA power generation setup has been built. The boiler was refueled (Step 89) but the steam engine is still not connected to the electric network. Several attempts were made to place and connect small electric poles (Steps 88, 90, 91, 93), but they failed to achieve a 'WORKING' status, indicating a connection issue or lack of power generation. A pole was placed at `x=6.5 y=2.5` in Step 93.\nConsists of following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position `x=-9.5 y=-0.5`\n- Boiler at position `x=-2.0 y=1.5` (currently out of fuel)\n- Steam Engine at position `x=6.5 y=4.5`\n- Pipe Group connecting the pump to the boiler (carrying water) starting near `x=-8.5 y=-0.5`\n- Pipe Group connecting the boiler to the steam engine (carrying steam) starting near `x=-3.5 y=1.5`\n- Small Electric Pole at position `x=6.5 y=2.5` (Currently not powered, status: NORMAL)\n\n### Coal Mining for Boiler at x=16.0 y=0.0\nA basic coal mining setup was created to potentially automate boiler fueling. An inserter placement failed due to an existing pipe.\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position `x=16.0 y=0.0` (fueled with coal)\n- Wooden Chest at position `x=16.5 y=1.5` (receiving coal from drill)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting at x=15.5 y=70.5\nThis setup extracts iron ore and smelts it into iron plates. It remains unpowered.\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric Mining Drill at position `x=15.5 y=70.5` (outputting to furnace)\n- Stone Furnace at position `x=16.0 y=73.0`\n- Electric Mining Drill at position `x=19.5 y=70.5` (outputting to furnace)\n- Stone Furnace at position `x=20.0 y=73.0`\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Setup (Partial) near x=24.5 y=16.5\nAn assembling machine setup intended for iron gear wheels exists but is not powered or supplied with materials.\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling Machine 2 at position `x=24.5 y=16.5` (recipe set to iron-gear-wheel)\n- Inserter at `x=24.5 y=14.5` (intended input)\n- Inserter at `x=24.5 y=18.5` (intended output)\n- Wooden Chest at `x=24.5 y=19.5` (intended output destination)\n- BeltGroup near `x=24.5 y"}
