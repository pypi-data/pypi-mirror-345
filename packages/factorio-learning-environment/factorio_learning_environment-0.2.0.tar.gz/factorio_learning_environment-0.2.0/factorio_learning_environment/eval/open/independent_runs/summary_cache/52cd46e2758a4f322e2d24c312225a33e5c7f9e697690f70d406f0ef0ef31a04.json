{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map in these steps. Multiple attempts were made to supply a Lab structure at position (0.5, 2.5), but all such efforts failed due to an absence of the Lab item in the inventory. In addition, two smelting facilities were referenced during resource processing:\n\u2022 An iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used to boost iron-plate supply.\n\u2022 A copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) employed for copper ore conversion.\nThese furnaces were retrieved from the environment rather than constructed during the current execution steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage with get_entities\n  - Use only the parameters supported by the function. Avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. remove 'radius' if not accepted) and ensure the number of positional arguments matches the function\u2019s signature.\n\n\u2022 Iteration over Potential None Values\n  - Always verify that a function call (such as get_entities) returns an iterable value before attempting to iterate over it. Default to an empty list when needed to prevent errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n  - Confirm the Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  - Ensure all prerequisite sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are sufficiently available. Address resource shortages by completing required intermediary production (e.g. smelting and component crafting) prior to initiating Lab crafting.\n  - Monitor and update resource counts to satisfy the dependencies for crafting a Lab successfully.\n\n"}
