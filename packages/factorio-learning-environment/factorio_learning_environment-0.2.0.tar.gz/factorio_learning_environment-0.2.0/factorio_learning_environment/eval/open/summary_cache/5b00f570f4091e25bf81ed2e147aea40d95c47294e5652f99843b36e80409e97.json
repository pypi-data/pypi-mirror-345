{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently without power and output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and working, with frequent full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates and feeding the assembling machine input.\n- Burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and newly placed at (22.5, 75.5), all fueled and operational, moving iron plates between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace output remains unresolved, causing mining drill stoppage and furnace output inventory full warnings.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage with inserters feeding the assembling machine input chest, though power and output flow issues persist.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), not connected to power network and lacking input fluid, thus not generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5), with no recent successful power generation.\n\nThis structure is intended for steam power generation but is currently non-operational due to fuel shortage in the boiler and lack of power network connection for the steam engine.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), not receiving power and unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates and no input inventory.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) and output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), both currently empty.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5), (25.5, 83.5), and newly placed at (22.5, 75.5), all fueled and operational, intended to move materials between chests and assembling machine.\n- Newly placed burner inserter at (22.5, 75.5) to feed assembler input chest.\n- Assembling machine reports missing iron plates and no crafting activity, with input and output inventories empty.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with inserters and chests arranged, but lacks power and sufficient input materials to operate.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage and power connectivity issues in mining and smelting structure\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains without power and blocked due to furnace output belt blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting output and causing mining drill stoppage.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept iron plates, and ensure uninterrupted power supply to the mining drill and furnace.\n\n### Steam power generation failures due to fuel and network connection\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, causing the steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) to not generate power.\n- Steam engine is not connected to the electric power network, further preventing power generation.\n- Insert coal into the boiler to restart steam production and connect the steam engine properly to the power network using electric poles.\n\n### Assembling machine non-operation due to power and input shortages\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) is not receiving power and reports missing iron plates, preventing crafting.\n- Input and output inventories of the assembler remain empty despite iron plates being inserted into the input chest.\n- Ensure the assembling machine is powered by connecting nearby electric poles and verify inserters are correctly feeding iron plates into the assembler input.\n- Newly placed burner inserter at (22.5, 75.5) to feed input chest is operational but may need verification for correct placement and connection.\n\n### Entity retrieval errors for burner inserter at (24.5, 75.5)\n- Attempt to get burner inserter entity at (24.5, 75.5) failed due to no entity found at that position.\n- Verify entity positions before retrieval and ensure the entity exists at the specified"}
