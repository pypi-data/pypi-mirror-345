{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -50.0), which is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -49.5), which is responsible for moving iron ore from a wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is refueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -49.5), which acts as a storage for iron ore before it is inserted into the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have enough items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" or \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Make sure that inserters are correctly aligned with both the source and destination entities. Rotating inserters to align them properly can prevent operational issues.\n"}
