{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line (x=0.0 to x=6.0, y=-2.5 to y=1.5)\nA complex smelting setup consisting of:\n\nInput Section:\n- 4 wooden chests at y=-2.5 (x coordinates: 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 6.5) containing iron ore and coal\n- 4 burner inserters at y=-1.5 (x coordinates: 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 6.5) feeding furnaces\n\nSmelting Section:\n- 4 stone furnaces at y=0.0 (x coordinates: 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0) processing iron ore into iron plates\n\nOutput Section:\n- 3 wooden chests at y=1.5 (x coordinates: 2.5, 4.5, 6.5) for collecting processed iron plates\n- 4 burner inserters at y=1.5 (x coordinates: 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.5) moving processed plates\n\nAll furnaces are operational and working, with fuel and iron ore being processed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Output Blocking Issues\n- Multiple inserters are showing \"output blocked by item on the ground\" warnings\n- Ensure proper placement of output containers (chests) aligned with inserter drop positions\n- Verify that inserters have clear paths to drop items into their destination entities\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Attempting to insert items that are not in inventory\n- Always verify item availability in inventory before attempting insertion operations\n- Mine or craft required items before trying to insert them\n\n### System Design Considerations\n- The current smelting line has gaps in the output collection system\n- Ensure complete coverage of output collection to prevent items being stuck on ground\n- All inserters should have proper destination containers aligned with their drop positions"}
