{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, with various pipe positions including (-46.5, -122.5), (-44.5, -117.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Small Electric Pole at Position (5.5, -60.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups with various fluid systems and positions, such as:\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-46.5, -122.5) with fluid system 41940\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -121.5) with fluid system 41941\n  - Additional PipeGroups with positions and fluid systems as listed in the logs.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions such as (0.5, 20.5), (2.5, 20.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and positioned to connect fluid systems. Verify the positions and paths of pipes to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Steam\n- Confirm that the boiler is properly connected to the steam engine and that the boiler has a sufficient supply of water and fuel. Check the pipe connections for any breaks or misalignments.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that the inserter is within the coverage area of a powered electric pole. Ensure that the electricity network is complete and connected to a power source.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly check and empty chests at mining drill drop positions to prevent production halts due to full inventories."}
