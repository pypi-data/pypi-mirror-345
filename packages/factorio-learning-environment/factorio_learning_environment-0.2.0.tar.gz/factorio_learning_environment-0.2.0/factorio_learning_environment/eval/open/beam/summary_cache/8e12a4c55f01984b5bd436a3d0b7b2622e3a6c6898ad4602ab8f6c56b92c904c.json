{"content": "Ah, now I see the real issue! The error message is telling us that we're trying to place the furnace at (0,0) which is too far from our current position. The maximum placement distance is 10 units, and we need to be closer. Let's fix this by:\n\n1. Using our actual position for placement\n2. Moving to the desired placement location first\n3. Using get_player_position() to ensure we place it where we are\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\n# Check current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# First get some coal\ncoal_pos = nearest(Resource.Coal)\nmove_to(coal_pos)\ncoal_mined = harvest_resource(coal_pos, quantity=10)\nprint(f\"Harvested {coal_mined} coal\")\n\n# Now get iron ore\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_pos)\niron_mined = harvest_resource(iron_pos, quantity=10)\nprint(f\"Harvested {iron_mined} iron ore\")\n\n# Get our current position and place furnace there\nplayer_pos = get_player_position()\nprint(f\"Player position: {player_pos}\")\n\n# Move slightly away from the resource to place the furnace\noffset_pos = (player_pos[0] + 2, player_pos[1] + 2)  # Move 2 units away in both directions\nmove_to(offset_pos)\n\n# Place furnace at our new position\nfurnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=offset_pos)\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Insert fuel and ore with verification\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\nsleep(1)\nfurnace_state = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace.position)\nprint(f\"Furnace state after coal: {furnace_state}\")\n\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=10)\nsleep(1)\nfurnace_state = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace.position)\nprint(f\"Furnace state after iron ore: {furnace_state}\")\n\n# Wait for smelting\nfor _ in range(5):\n    furnace_state = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace.position)\n    print(f\"Furnace state: {furnace_state}\")\n    sleep(1)\n\n# Final check\nprint(f\"Final furnace state: {furnace_state}\")\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should resolve the \"too far away\" error by:\n1. Getting our actual position first\n2. Moving to a suitable placement location\n3. Placing the furnace at our new position\n4. Ensuring we're close enough to interact with it\n\nThe key learning here is that we need to be within 10 units of where we want to place entities, and using (0,0) as a default position isn't suitable. We should always use our current position or a nearby position that we've moved to first.", "summary_range": "[1-1712]"}
