{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Smelting Setup at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- First furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Second furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nBoth furnaces are currently without fuel and ingredients.\n\n###Copper and Iron Mining/Smelting Setup with Collection System at position(-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- First burner mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0), rotated downward, fueled with 23 coal\n- Second burner mining drill at position (-26.0, -61.0), rotated downward, fueled with 23 coal\n- First furnace at position (-27.0, -59.0), fueled with 24 coal, containing 10 copper plates\n- Second furnace at position (-25.0, -59.0), fueled with 24 coal, containing 10 iron plates\n- Collection system for copper furnace:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-26.5, -56.5), currently out of fuel\n  - Wooden chest at position (-26.5, -55.5)\n- Collection system for iron furnace:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-24.5, -56.5), currently out of fuel\n  - Wooden chest at position (-24.5, -55.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when trying to place entities in already occupied positions\n- Before placing furnaces or other entities, verify the target position is completely free\n- Check if any entity's working area or drop position overlaps with the intended placement location\n- Consider the full tile dimensions of both existing and new entities when planning placement\n\n### Errors when trying to place inserters in invalid positions\n- When placing inserters next to mining drills, ensure the position doesn't conflict with the drill's drop position\n- Consider the tile dimensions and working area of existing entities before placing inserters\n- For mining drills, the drop position is a critical operational point and cannot be blocked by other entities\n- When placing inserters, ensure there's enough clearance from other entities' working areas\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces or drills, try increasing the spacing parameter if initial placement fails\n\n### Errors related to entity spacing and direction\n- When using place_entity_next_to, carefully consider the spacing parameter\n- If placement fails, try increasing the spacing value\n- Consider alternative directions when the desired placement direction is blocked\n- Verify that the reference position and direction combination will result in a valid placement\n\n### Errors when trying to extract non-existent items\n- Verify the item type exists in the entity before attempting extraction\n- Double check the entity type matches the expected source\n- Ensure the correct item type is being targeted for extraction\n\n### Errors related to blocked output\n- Mining drills become blocked when their output location is full\n- Place appropriate storage or transport systems (like chests or belts) at the drop positions\n- Ensure there's a way to remove processed items from furnaces to prevent output blockage\n- When using inserters, ensure their drop position has available space\n- For mining drills, monitor the drop position coordinates (-27.5, -59.5) and (-25.5, -59.5) for blockages\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from player position\n- Maximum placement distance is 10 units from player position\n- Move closer to the target location before attempting to place entities\n- Calculate distance between current position and target position before placement\n\n### Errors related to entity fuel and resource management\n- Check inventory for required resources before attempting to insert them\n- Verify coal availability before attempting to fuel entities\n- Keep track of resource counts in inventory to prevent failed insertion attempts\n- Monitor fuel levels of all powered entities (mining drills, inserters, etc.)\n- Ensure to maintain sufficient coal reserves for refueling multiple entities in sequence\n\n### Errors related to inserter operation\n- Ensure inserters have fuel before expecting them to operate\n- Keep track of coal in inventory before attempting to fuel inserters\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels to prevent operation interruption\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended source and destination entities"}
