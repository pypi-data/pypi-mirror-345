The current attempt to place a new electric pole at position (-1.5, -9.5) failed because it is not a valid location.\n\n### Errors related to entity connections\n- The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network. Ensure that all necessary connections are made and that the entities are properly linked to avoid status warnings.\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- The error indicates that 'new_pole' is not defined. Always ensure that variables are properly initialized before use to prevent NameErrors."}
