{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-82.5), connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) containing coal.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) containing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Coal Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5) and outputs to Belt at (x=49.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5), transporting coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) with a pickup position at (x=53.5, y=-83.5) and a drop position at (x=55.5, y=-83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Smelting Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure that all required materials are available in the inventory before attempting to craft automation science packs. The ingredients needed are copper plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Coal\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before attempting to extract coal. Empty the chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### No Ores Available to Smelt\n- Verify that there are ores available in the furnace source inventory before attempting to smelt. If no ores are available, gather the necessary resources."}
