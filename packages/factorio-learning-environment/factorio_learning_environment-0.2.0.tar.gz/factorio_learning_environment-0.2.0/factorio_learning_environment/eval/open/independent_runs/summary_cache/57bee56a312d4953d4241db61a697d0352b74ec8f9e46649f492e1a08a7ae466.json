{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 3})\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Entity(name='stone-furnace', direction=DOWN, position=Position(x=-14.0, y=-49.0))\n  - Drop Position: Position(x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: [Ingredient(name='iron-ore', count=40000, type=None)]\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Inventory({})\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest**: Ensure that the location is not occupied by another entity or obstruction before attempting to place a wooden chest.\n- **Cannot place Burner Inserter**: Verify that there is sufficient space and the correct orientation for placing a burner inserter next to the desired entity.\n- **Cannot place Transport Belt**: Make sure the desired location for placing a transport belt is free of obstructions and is aligned correctly with existing belts or entities.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- **Cannot move the Stone Furnace**: Confirm that the target location is unoccupied and suitable for placing a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors related to entity retrieval\n- **Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace**: Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it using the API.\n\n### Warnings related to production\n- **Output blocked by item on the ground**: Ensure there is a sink entity (e.g., chest, belt) to accept the output from the burner mining drill to prevent blockage.\n- **No ingredients to smelt**: Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to continue smelting operations."}
