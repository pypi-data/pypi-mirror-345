{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Smelting Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Transport belt at (41.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0) facing UP\n\nThe structure is designed to mine coal and transport it via belt to be processed in the furnace. Currently the mining drill is operational with coal fuel, the belt has some coal, and the furnace has fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Multiple failed attempts to place inserters due to existing objects blocking the target location\n- Before placing inserters, ensure the target location is clear of other entities\n- Verify the exact coordinates and surrounding space requirements for inserter placement\n- Consider removing blocking entities first if needed\n\n### Errors with entity rotation\n- Failed attempt to rotate stone furnace\n- Some entities cannot be rotated after placement\n- Place entities in the correct orientation initially rather than trying to rotate them later\n\n### Entity fueling issues\n- Mining drill running out of fuel periodically\n- Implement regular fuel checking and refueling routines\n- Consider automating the fuel supply system\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails if target location is blocked.\n- rotate_entity(entity, direction): Rotates entities. Not all entities support rotation.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace: Entity of type 'stone-furnace'\n- inserter: Entity of type 'burner-inserter'\n- mining_drill: Entity of type 'burner-mining-drill'\n- belt: Entity of type 'transport-belt'\n\nEntity States:\n- Mining drill status: Working when fueled\n- Furnace status: NO_INGREDIENTS when empty\n- Belt status: Working\n- Inserter status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS"}
