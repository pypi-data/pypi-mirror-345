{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mine at (17.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Burner Mining Drill at position (17.0, 1.0) mining coal.\n*   Wooden Chest at position (17.5, 2.5) collecting coal from the drill.\n\n### Power Generation at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n*   Boiler at position (-3.0, 1.5) consuming fuel (coal) to heat water.\n*   Steam Engine at position (4.5, 4.5) consuming steam to generate power (currently not connected to any network).\n*   PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler (positions include (-8.5,-0.5), (-7.5,-0.5), (-4.5,-0.5), (-3.5,-0.5)).\n*   PipeGroup connecting the Boiler to the Steam Engine (positions include (-1.5,1.5), (-0.5,1.5), (0.5,1.5), ..., (1.5,2.5), (1.5,3.5), (1.5,4.5)).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n*   Ensure the target tile for placing an entity is valid and not occupied by another entity or unbuildable terrain (like water) before attempting placement. Check the specific entity's placement constraints.\n*   Even if an area is identified as generally buildable, verify the specific placement tile using `can_place` before asserting or placing, as the agent's own position or other factors might still prevent placement.\n\n### NameErrors when using variables\n*   Ensure that variables are assigned a value (e.g., by successfully finding an entity or resource patch)"}
