{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler and steam engine with various pipe segments, starting from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump and boiler, starting from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, including (x=14.5, y=20.5) and (x=35.5, y=20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n### Errors due to missing entities in inventory\n- Verify that the required entities are present in the inventory before attempting to place or connect them. For example, ensure steam engines are available before placement.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect entities over long distances\n- Ensure that the entities to be connected, such as boilers and steam engines, are within a feasible distance for connection. Use pipes or underground pipes appropriately to bridge gaps.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect prototype usage\n- Use the correct prototype names when referencing entities. For example, use `PipeGroup` instead of `PipeToGround` if that is the correct attribute.\n\n### Errors in connecting electrical entities without required items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items, such as small electric poles, in your inventory before attempting to connect them to the power network."}
