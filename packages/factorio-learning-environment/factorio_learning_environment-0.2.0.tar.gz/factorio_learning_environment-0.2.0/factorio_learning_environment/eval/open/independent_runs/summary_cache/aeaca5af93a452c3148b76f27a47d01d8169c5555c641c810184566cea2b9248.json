{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace is currently full with iron plates and has a fuel inventory of coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) extracting coal. The drill is currently blocked due to lack of space in the destination.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) used to transfer coal from the mining drill to a transport belt. The inserter is waiting for source items.\n- Transport Belt system connecting the mining drill and inserter, with verified alignment at positions (43.5, -82.5), (43.5, -80.5), and (43.5, -79.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing entities like Wooden Chests and transport belts is clear of obstructions and other entities to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- Make sure there is a sink entity or sufficient space for the output of entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with transport belt connections\n- Verify that transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to avoid issues with extending or reconnecting belts.\n\n### Errors with full inventories\n- Regularly check and clear full inventories of entities like Stone Furnaces to maintain production flow and prevent output blockage."}
