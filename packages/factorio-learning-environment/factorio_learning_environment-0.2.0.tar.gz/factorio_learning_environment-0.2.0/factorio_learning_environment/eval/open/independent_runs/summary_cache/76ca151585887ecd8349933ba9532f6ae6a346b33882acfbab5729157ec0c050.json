{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been created on the map yet based on the provided logs.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors with inventory tracking\n- When harvesting resources, ensure proper inventory tracking is implemented. The logs show a case where coal was harvested but the inventory system did not properly register it, leading to an assertion error\n- Implement proper inventory update mechanisms after harvesting resources\n\n### Resource harvesting efficiency\n- Consider harvesting larger amounts of resources in a single operation to avoid multiple trips\n- The logs show small amounts of coal being harvested (5-10 units) which may be inefficient for larger scale operations\n\nNote: The execution logs show only resource harvesting activities and no structure building yet. The inventory shows possession of various items (burner inserters, furnaces, etc.) but no structures have been placed on the map."}
