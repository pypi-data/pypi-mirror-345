{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer Station at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) receiving coal from the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another wooden chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items to transfer coal from the chest at (52.5, -77.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Station at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items to transfer iron ore from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest at (-13.5, -45.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the required source items. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n\n### Errors with Extraction from Chests\n- Verify that the chest contains the required quantity of items before attempting extraction. Ensure that the chest is not full and has space for additional items.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full drop positions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from a given entity. Ensure the entity has sufficient items before invoking this function to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_extracted: int`: Stores the quantity of iron ore extracted. Ensure this variable is updated correctly after successful extraction operations."}
