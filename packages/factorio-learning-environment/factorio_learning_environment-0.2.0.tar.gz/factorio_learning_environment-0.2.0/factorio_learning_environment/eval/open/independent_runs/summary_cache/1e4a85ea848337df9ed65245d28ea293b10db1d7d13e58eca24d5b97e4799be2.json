{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Electricity Generator at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) (status: `NOT_CONNECTED`, warnings: \"no fluid present in connections\")  \n- **Boiler** at (x=-7.0, y=0.5) (unpowered, warnings: \"out of fuel\", \"no input liquid\", \"no fluid present in connections\")  \n- **Steam engine** at (x=-3.5, y=0.5) (unpowered, warnings: \"not connected to power network\", \"no input liquid\", \"no fluid present in connections\")  \n- **Pipe network** (fluid system 5782)  \n  - Pipes at (x=-8.5, y=0.5) (status: `EMPTY`)  \n\n#### Oil Extraction and Processing Facility at position (x=17.5, y=40.5)  \n*(Unchanged from previous report, no updates in these steps.)*  \n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Pipe Placement and Connection Issues  \n- **Repeated pipe placement failures** (Steps 96, 101, 102, 103)  \n  - Clear obstructions at (x=-8.0, -0.5), (-7.5, -0.5), (-8.0, 0.0) before placing pipes/underground belts.  \n  - Verify target positions are empty using `find_entities` before placement.  \n\n#### Fluid System Connection Failures  \n- **Pump-to-pipe connection errors** (Steps 97\u2013100, 102)  \n  - Ensure pump output (x=-8.5, y=-0.5) aligns with pipe input direction (RIGHT by default).  \n  - Use `connection_points` API to validate valid fluid transfer paths before placement.  \n\n#### Underground Belt Misplacement  \n- **Underground belt blocked** (Steps 96, 103)  \n  - Avoid overlapping with existing entities (e.g., pipes at x=-7.5, y=0.0).  \n\n#### General Placement Best Practices  \n- **Systematic teardown/rebuild inefficiencies** (Steps 97\u2013103)  \n  - Plan pipe routes before placement to minimize rebuilds.  \n  - Use `nearest_buildable` with explicit `entity` and `direction` arguments.  \n\n#### New Issues in Steps 102\u2013103  \n- **Boiler fuel shortage** (Step 103)  \n  - Insert coal into boiler manually or via inserter.  \n\n---\n\n### NAMESPACE  \n*(No new functions defined by the agent in these steps.)*"}
