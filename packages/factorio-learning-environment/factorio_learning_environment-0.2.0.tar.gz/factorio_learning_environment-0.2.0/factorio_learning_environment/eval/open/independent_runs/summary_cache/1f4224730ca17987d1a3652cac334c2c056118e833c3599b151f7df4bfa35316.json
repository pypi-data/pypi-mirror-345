{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Connected via PipeGroup with pipes at positions: (20.5, -10.5), (21.5, -10.5), (22.5, -10.5), ..., (20.5, -6.5), (20.5, -7.5), (20.5, -5.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions: (12.5, -4.5), (22.5, -4.5), ..., (x=-5.5, y=1.5), (x=-2.5, y=0.5), (x=-2.5, y=1.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position (9.5, 5.5) that puts into the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at position (5.0, 5.0) to the assembling machine at position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, 18.5)\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-3.5, 0.5) and (-3.5, 2.5)\n- Inserter at position (-3.5, 1.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the entity from which you are trying to extract items contains the specified items. For example, the error when extracting copper cables from the assembling machine at position (10.5, 0.5) occurred because the entity did not contain copper cables.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Make sure the inserter has source items available to pick up. The inserter at position (9.5, 5.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a shortage in the supply chain.\n\n### Errors when Managing Inventory\n- Regularly check and manage your inventory to ensure that resources are available where needed. Consider relocating resources from empty chests, as indicated by the empty chest at position (-3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Errors when Assembling Items\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available for the assembling machine to function correctly. The assembling machine at position (10.5, 0.5) cannot create copper cables due to missing copper plates."}
