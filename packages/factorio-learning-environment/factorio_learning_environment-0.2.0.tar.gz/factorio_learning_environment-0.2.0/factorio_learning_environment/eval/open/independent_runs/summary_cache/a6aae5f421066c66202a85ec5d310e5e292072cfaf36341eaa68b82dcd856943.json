{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Steam engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Pipe groups connecting various components:\n  - Pipe group at position (-4.5, 16.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe group at position (-9.5, 23.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT\n  - Pipe group at position (-7.5, 24.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe group at position (-4.5, 24.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe group at position (-5.5, 16.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe group at position (-5.5, 24.5) - Status: EMPTY\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Status: NO_INGREDIENTS or WORKING depending on the step\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes on Water\n- Ensure that pipes are placed on valid land tiles and do not overlap with water. Adjust the position to avoid water tiles.\n\n### Errors with Pipe-to-Ground Placement\n- Verify that the target location for pipe-to-ground is free from water overlap and other obstructions before placing.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, ensure iron plates are available for crafting pipe-to-ground.\n\n### Connection Errors in Electricity Generation\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity generator (steam engine, boiler, and pipes) are properly connected to each other and the electricity network.\n\n### API Misuse Errors\n- Double-check API calls for correct attribute names and types. For example, ensure that the correct attributes are used when referencing prototypes.\n\n### Assertion Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Verify that required resources, such as iron ore, are available before attempting operations that depend on them, like smelting.\n\n### Incorrect Inventory Management\n- Keep track of inventory levels to ensure that there are sufficient items for crafting and placement operations."}
