{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -53.5) with direction UP, responsible for moving items onto the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -52.5) with direction LEFT, responsible for moving items onto the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5) with direction UP, responsible for moving items from the furnace.\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities, facilitating the movement of items between them.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Furnace\n- Ensure the furnace contains the required items before attempting to extract. Check that the furnace is properly fueled and has the correct input materials.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to a stone furnace. Use an inserter to transfer items between belts and furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Burner Inserter Placement\n- Verify that there is a suitable position for placing burner inserters. Ensure the tile is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Attribute Errors with Position Objects\n- Ensure that the position objects used have the correct attributes required for operations. Double-check the API documentation for correct usage.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items. Iron plates must be smelted in a furnace and cannot be crafted directly.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status and fuel levels of entities to ensure they are operational.\n- Verify the connectivity and direction of belts and inserters to ensure efficient item flow."}
