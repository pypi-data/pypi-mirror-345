{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT, fueled by coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Mining and Transport System at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0), fueled by coal, with a status of WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, connected to a transport belt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5), fueled by coal, with a status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, transferring items from the mining drill to the transport belt.\n- Transport Belt system connecting positions (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5), facilitating the movement of mined resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Check for obstructions and clear them if necessary.\n\n### Errors when extending or reconnecting transport belts\n- Verify that the intended path for extending or reconnecting transport belts is clear and properly aligned with existing belts to avoid connection issues.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from production entities like mining drills and furnaces to prevent output blockage.\n\n### Errors related to full inventories\n- Regularly check and manage inventories of entities such as furnaces and inserters to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
