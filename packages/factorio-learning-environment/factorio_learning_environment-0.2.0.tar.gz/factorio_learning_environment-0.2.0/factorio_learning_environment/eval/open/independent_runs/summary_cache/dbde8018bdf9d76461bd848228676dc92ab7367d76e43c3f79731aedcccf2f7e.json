{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-7.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -7.5, 23.0), offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), and small electric pole (position -5.5, 21.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel, and the offshore pump is working, providing water to the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) for processing copper ore.\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) for processing iron ore.\n\n### Lab at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a lab (position 5.0, 5.0). The lab is currently not powered and is set to research automation.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to access a lab that does not exist\n- Ensure that a lab is placed at the specified position before trying to access it. In this case, the lab at position (5.0, 5.0) could not be found, which suggests it may not have been placed correctly.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
