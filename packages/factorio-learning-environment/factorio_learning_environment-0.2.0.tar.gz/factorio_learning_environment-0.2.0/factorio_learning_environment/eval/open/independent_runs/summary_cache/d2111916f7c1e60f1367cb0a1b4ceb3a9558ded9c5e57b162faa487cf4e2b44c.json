{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (20.5, 21.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Wooden chest (source) at position (20.5, 21.5)\n- Source inserter at position (21.5, 21.5) facing downward\n- Furnace inserter at position (22.5, 20.5) facing right\n- Stone furnace at position (24.0, 20.0)\n- Belt group connecting the inserters with complex routing:\n  - Input belt at (22.5, 22.5)\n  - Multiple transport belts forming a path between source and furnace inserters\n  - Output belt ending at (21.5, 21.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Connection Inefficiencies\n- The current belt connection between inserters is overly complex with unnecessary routing\n- Create direct, shorter belt connections between components to improve efficiency\n- Minimize the number of belt segments and turns when connecting entities\n\n### Entity Placement and Spacing\n- Ensure proper spacing between production line components\n- Place related entities (like inserters and furnaces) close to each other to minimize belt length\n- Consider the direction of inserters and belt flow when planning layout\n\nNote: Since this is the first report (no previous history), only the current structure and observed issues are included."}
