{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -51.5), used for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (-14.5, -51.5), transferring iron ore from the chest.\n  - At position (-13.5, -51.5), moving iron ore onto the transport belt.\n  - At position (-15.5, -48.5), awaiting source items from the mining drill.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter at (-13.5, -51.5) to the processing area.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (0.5, -1.5), feeding iron ore into the furnace.\n  - At position (-1.5, 0.5), removing iron plates from the furnace.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- **BeltGroup**: Connects the iron ore mining area to the furnace, facilitating the movement of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts\n- Ensure that belts are connected between valid entities. Belts cannot connect directly to a stone furnace; use an inserter to input items into the furnace.\n- Verify the path when connecting belts between entities, ensuring it is valid and can be normalized.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Avoid placing entities on occupied tiles. Check for existing entities at the target position before placing a new one.\n- Adjust spacing or direction when placing entities like inserters to prevent overlap with existing structures.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that entities requiring fuel, such as burner inserters and mining drills, are adequately stocked with coal or other fuel sources.\n- Avoid checking attributes like 'fuel' on entities that do not possess them, such as chests.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Correctly reference entity types in code. For instance, use 'entities.BurnerMiningDrill' instead of 'BurnerMiningDrill' to avoid NameErrors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: Used to connect entities via transport belts. Ensure valid connections between compatible entities.\n- **place_entity_next_to**: Places an entity adjacent to a reference position. Adjust spacing and direction to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `ore_inserter`: Represents an inserter used for moving ore.\n- `furnace_position`: Position of the stone furnace for processing materials.\n- `chest_position`: Position of the wooden chest for storing mined resources.\n- `drill`: Represents the mining drill entity for resource extraction."}
