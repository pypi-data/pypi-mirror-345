{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units)\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  \n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (9 units)\n  - Neighbours: Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when extracting with insufficient quantity\n- Ensure that the quantity of items to extract is greater than zero before attempting extraction from a container.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and setup\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure that the pickup and drop positions are correctly set and that the source entity contains the necessary items for transfer.\n\n### Errors with full chest at drop position\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting due to full inventories.\n\n### Errors with furnace not receiving ingredients\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly transferring items into the furnace. Check that the source inventory contains the necessary ingredients and that the inserter is operational and properly fueled."}
