{"content": "I notice a pattern in the errors - we need to properly handle entity types. Let's analyze what we've learned:\n\n1. Key Issues Identified:\n- Can't directly use class types like `BurnerMiningDrill`\n- Need to craft items before placing them\n- Need to check inventory before operations\n\n2. Successful Patterns:\n- Using `get_entities()` with prototype filtering works\n- Using `get_prototype_recipe()` to check recipes works\n- Crafting items with `craft_item()` works\n\n3. Better Approach:\n```python\n# First check recipe and craft burner inserter\nrecipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.BurnerInserter)\nprint(f\"Burner inserter recipe: {recipe}\")\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Get our existing drill using prototype filtering\ndrills = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})\nif drills:\n    drill = drills[0]\n    move_to(drill.position)\n    \n    # Place inserter at drill's output\n    inserter = place_entity(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter, \n        position=drill.drop_position,\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT\n    )\n    \n    if inserter:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n        print(f\"Placed and fueled inserter at: {inserter.position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Final entities: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nTips for Future:\n1. Always use Prototype enums instead of class names\n2. Check inventory before placing items\n3. Use get_entities() with specific prototype filtering\n4. Verify positions before placing entities\n5. Keep track of fuel levels in burner entities\n\nWould you like me to try executing this improved code?", "summary_range": "[1-240]"}
