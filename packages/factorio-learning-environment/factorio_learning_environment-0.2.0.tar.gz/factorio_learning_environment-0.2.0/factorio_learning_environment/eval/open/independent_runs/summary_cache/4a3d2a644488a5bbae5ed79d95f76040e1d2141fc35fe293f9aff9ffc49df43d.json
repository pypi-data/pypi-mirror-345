{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is fueled by coal and is actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) used for storing mined resources.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) used for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. These furnaces are fueled by coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources or smelted products are emptied regularly to prevent mining and smelting operations from halting due to full inventory warnings.\n\n### Errors Related to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials (iron ore) to maintain continuous production. Regularly check and replenish the input resources.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron ore in the inventory.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron plates in the inventory.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal in the inventory."}
