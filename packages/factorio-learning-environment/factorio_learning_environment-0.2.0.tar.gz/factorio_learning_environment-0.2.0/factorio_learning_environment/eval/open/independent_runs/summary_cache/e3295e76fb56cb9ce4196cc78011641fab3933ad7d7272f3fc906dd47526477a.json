{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Responsible for extracting iron ore.\n  - Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Used to store extracted iron ore.\n  - Contains 15 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - Currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Currently not receiving iron ore and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Resource Transfer\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer resources from the chest to the furnace. Reposition and align inserters if necessary to ensure smooth resource transfer.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly extract resources from the chest to free up space.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Resource Input\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving sufficient iron ore to maintain continuous smelting operations. Check inserter setups and alignments to resolve issues with resource input."}
