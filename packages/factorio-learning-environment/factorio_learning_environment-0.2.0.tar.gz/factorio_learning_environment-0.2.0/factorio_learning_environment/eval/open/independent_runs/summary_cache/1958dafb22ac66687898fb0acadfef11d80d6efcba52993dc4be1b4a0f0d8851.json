{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. The agent repeatedly attempted to produce and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to research, but all Lab-related operations failed due to resource shortages and inventory issues. In addition, while two processing units were referenced during smelting operations, they are pre\u2010existing entities rather than agent\u2010constructed structures:\n\u2022 Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) \u2013 used for converting iron ore (with coal) into iron plates.\n\u2022 Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) \u2013 used for converting copper ore (with coal) into copper plates.\nThese processing units support resource production but do not represent structures built by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval\n  \u2013 When calling get_entities, use the exact API signature. Avoid passing keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extraneous positional arguments if the function does not require them.\n\u2022 Validation of Retrieved Entities\n  \u2013 Confirm that the output from retrieval calls is iterable before processing. This prevents errors like attempting to iterate over a NoneType.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting\n  \u2013 Before attempting placement, verify that the Lab item exists in the inventory.\n  \u2013 Check that all required resources and sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available to satisfy the Lab crafting recipe.\n  \u2013 Review and validate recipe dependencies and resource availability to avoid crafting failures due to missing components.\n\u2022 Consistent Inventory Checks\n  \u2013 Regularly ensure that the resource counts match the requirements for crafting operations so that operations are not initiated when ingredients are insufficient."}
