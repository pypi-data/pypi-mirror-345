{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between boiler and steam engine, and from offshore pump to boiler\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Pipe groups connecting various entities for fluid transport\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation-science-pack input, connected to the power supply\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions (1.5, 6.5), (1.5, 2.5), (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 10.5), and (1.5, 14.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure proper connection between boiler and steam engine using appropriate pipes and underground pipes. Verify the connection is established correctly to avoid disconnection issues.\n\n### Errors in Research Setting\n- Ensure that research is set correctly in the lab. Verify that the lab has the necessary science packs and that the research is initiated.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Keep track of inventory levels, especially for critical resources like coal, to avoid running out of fuel for boilers or other essential processes.\n\n### Errors in Item Insertion\n- Verify that the item to be inserted is available in the inventory before attempting to insert it into any entity like a boiler or furnace."}
