{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Two Burner Inserters at positions (-14.5, -46.5) and (-14.5, -45.5) managing the movement of items between entities.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) managing the movement of items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity connected to the inserter has items available for transfer. Regularly check and refill the source entities to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full inventories.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly extract smelted items from furnaces to prevent them from stopping production when their output inventory is full.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency. Regularly check and refill the source inventories."}
