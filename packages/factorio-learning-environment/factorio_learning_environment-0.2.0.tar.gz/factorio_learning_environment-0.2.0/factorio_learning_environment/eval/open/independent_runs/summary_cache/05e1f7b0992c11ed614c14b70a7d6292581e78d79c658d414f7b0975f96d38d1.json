{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which is extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Refueling Setup\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5) which is responsible for refueling the stone furnace with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserters\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly set up to transfer iron ore into the furnace. Check the inserter's alignment and ensure it has a clear path to the furnace.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory. For example, ensure you have enough coal before attempting to refuel entities.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
