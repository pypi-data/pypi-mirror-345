{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) which is currently out of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) which is currently not receiving electricity and cannot create automation-science-pack due to missing resources: copper-plate (1) and iron-gear-wheel (1).\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine at position -21.5, 25.5.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 38393) at position (-18.5, 16.5) which is currently empty.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 38396) at position (-12.5, 21.5) which is currently full of water.\n- Additional pipe groups at positions (-9.5, 21.5), (-10.5, 22.5), and (-6.5, 23.5) which are currently empty.\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of multiple small electric poles:\n- Small electric poles at positions (-16.5, 18.5), (-16.5, 20.5), (-16.5, 21.5), and others that are part of the electricity group (id 211715) but are not providing power to connected entities.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure you are extracting from an entity that contains the item you want. In this case, the error occurred because there were no valid entities containing copper-plate at the specified position (-18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Errors when using assembling machines without power\n- Make sure that the assembling machine is connected to a power source before attempting to craft items. The assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) is not receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly connected to the entities they are supposed to serve. The steam engine has warnings indicating it is not connected to a power network and has no input liquid."}
