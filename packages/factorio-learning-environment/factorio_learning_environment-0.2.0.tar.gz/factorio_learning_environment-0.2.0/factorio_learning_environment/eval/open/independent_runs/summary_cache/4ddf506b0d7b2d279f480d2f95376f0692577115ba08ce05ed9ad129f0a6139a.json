{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59) smelting copper ore to plates\n- Input burner inserter at (-28.5, -58.5) moving ore from drill to furnace\n- Output burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates to storage\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), and (-6, -59)\n- Three wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\nNote: Currently drills are not operational due to lack of fuel\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n- Four input burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5)\n- Four fuel storage chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Four output burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- Four output storage chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- When placing inserters next to entities, ensure there is enough space and no collision with existing entities\n- Check if the target position is valid before attempting to place entities\n- Consider increasing spacing between entities if placement fails\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Ensure mining drills have fuel (coal) loaded before expecting them to operate\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner inserters and furnaces to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Entity Configuration\n- When setting up production lines, ensure all components (drills, inserters, furnaces) are properly connected and aligned\n- Verify that inserters are oriented in the correct direction to properly transfer items between entities"}
