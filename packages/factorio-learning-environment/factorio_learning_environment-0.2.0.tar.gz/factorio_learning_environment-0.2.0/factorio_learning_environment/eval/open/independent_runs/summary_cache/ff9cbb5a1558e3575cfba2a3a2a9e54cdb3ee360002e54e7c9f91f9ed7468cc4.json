{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at (15.5, 70.5) - UPDATED\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) facing DOWN (output at 15.5, 72.5)\n- Wooden chest at (17.5, 71.5) (new position)\n- Stone furnace removed (previously at 16.0, 73.0)\n- Transport belts connecting drill to chest (positions: (15.5,72.5) to (24.5,70.5))\n\n### Power generation setup at (-9.5, -0.5) - UPDATED\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) connected via pipes to:\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 3.5) (now fueled with coal)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5, 3.5) (now connected to power network)\n- Pipe network connecting offshore pump to boiler (positions: (-8.5,-0.5), (-6.5,-0.5), (-7.5,-0.5), (-4.5,-0.5), (-5.5,-0.5), (-3.5,-0.5))\n- Power pole network now operational (multiple positions)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement collision errors (continued)\n- Verify target position is clear before placing entities (now with 14 total occurrences)\n- Added specific water avoidance checks when placing near shorelines (4 water-related placement failures)\n- When replacing existing setups, clear old entities first before placing new ones\n\n### Power system improvements\n- Steam engine now properly connected to power network\n- Check power network coverage when placing new electrical devices\n\n### Furnace placement strategy\n- Survey terrain carefully before attempting furnace placement (6 failed attempts)\n- Maintain minimum distance from water bodies when placing production structures\n- Consider pre-clearing areas before attempting large placements\n\n### Entity verification\n- Verify entity existence before attempting operations on them (failed stone furnace and power pole checks)\n- Implement position validation before placement attempts\n\n### Production chain planning\n- Ensure complete clearance of old transport belts before redesigning layouts\n- Verify all components are properly spaced before finalizing production chains\n\n### New programming errors\n- Import required modules (math) before using their functions\n- Implement proper error handling for position finding functions\n- Verify power pole existence before attempting connections\n\n### Power connection verification\n- Double-check power pole placements to avoid duplicate placement attempts (2 new failures)\n- Verify electrical connections after placing new power poles\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- find_clear_position(position: Position, min_distance: int) -> Position\n  Attempts to find a clear position for entity placement\n  Failure: Missing math module import\n  Failure: No clear position found error not properly handled\n\n### Variables\n- base_position: Position - Stores base coordinates for operations\n- iron_drill: Entity - Reference to mining drill entity\n- power_pole: Entity - Reference to power pole entity"}
