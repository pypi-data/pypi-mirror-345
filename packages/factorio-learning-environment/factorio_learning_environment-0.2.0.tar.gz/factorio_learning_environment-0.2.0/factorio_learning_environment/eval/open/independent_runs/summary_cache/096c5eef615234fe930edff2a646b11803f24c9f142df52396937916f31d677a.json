{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\n- **Boiler** at position (-3.5, 26.0): Generates steam using coal as fuel.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (35.5, 27.5): Intended to generate electricity but currently not operational.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-7.5, 25.5): Supplies water to the boiler.\n- **Pipe Network**: Connects the offshore pump to the boiler and attempts to connect to the steam engine. Pipes are placed from x=-2.0 to x=16.0 along y=23.5, with additional pipes placed from x=20.0 to x=34.0 along y=23.5.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0)\n  - Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0)\n  - Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0)\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5)\n  - Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5)\n  - Inserter at position (19.5, 0.5)\n  - Inserter at position (20.5, 0.5)\n- **Chests**:\n  - Chest at position (8.5, -0.5)\n  - Chest at position (17.5, -0.5)\n  - Chest at position (19.5, -0.5)\n  - Chest at position (20.5, -0.5)\n  - Chest at position (8.5, 1.5) containing iron ore\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **PipeGroup** at various positions, connecting different parts of the facility, facilitating fluid transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before placing pipes. Clear any existing objects or unsuitable terrain before attempting to place pipes.\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to both the steam supply and the power network. Ensure that all pipes are correctly aligned and connected.\n\n### Incorrect Use of Underground Pipes\n- When placing underground pipes, ensure the correct prototype is used. The correct attribute should be `PipeGroup` instead of `PipeToGround`.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place them. For example, check for the availability of express underground belts before attempting to place them.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Steam\n- Check the pipe connections to ensure that steam can flow from the boiler to the steam engine without any blockages or disconnections."}
