{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(x=1.5, y=1.0)\nConsists of two boilers (positions (x=1.5, y=1.0) and (x=1.5, y=3.0)) and multiple pipes connected to them, as well as small electric poles at positions (x=3.5, y=0.5) and (x=3.5, y=2.5).\n\n### Offshore pump at position(x=-7.5, y=25.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) and connected pipes.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(x=-11.5, y=26.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position (x=-11.5, y=26.5) and connected pipes.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups, including one at position (x=1.5, y=-6.5) and another at position (x=3.5, y=-2.5), with multiple connected pipes.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when accessing PipeGroup\n- Ensure that a PipeGroup exists before trying to access it, to avoid IndexError: list index out of range.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Make sure that the entities are close enough to be connected, and that the connection points are valid, to avoid Exception: Failed to connect {'Pipe'} from offshore-pump to boiler. nil. \n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- No specific errors were found in the given logs, but general advice is to ensure that the target tile is empty and that the entity can be placed there."}
