{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully placed or updated on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Burner Mining Drill, Wooden Chest, and Stone Furnace is not occupied by another entity or is a valid buildable area. Consider checking the terrain and surrounding space before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect building box size\n- When determining a position for placing the Burner Mining Drill, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. If no viable spot is found, consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes.\n\n### Errors in setup not producing expected output\n- If a setup is not producing additional iron plates, review the configuration and connections between entities to ensure that resources are being correctly input and output. Verify that all necessary components are present and correctly aligned.\n\n### Errors when fetching entities from the map\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access, such as a Stone Furnace, exists at the specified position. Double-check the coordinates and confirm the presence of the entity before attempting to interact with it.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Before placing any entity, confirm that the target location is within reach and that no obstructions exist. This can prevent common placement errors and improve the efficiency of your setup."}
