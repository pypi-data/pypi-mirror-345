{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory leads to an error.\n\n### Errors from Out of Fuel and No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Regularly check and refuel furnaces to avoid them running out of fuel. Also, ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to prevent warnings and idle status.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into structures. Ensure the item and quantity are available in the inventory before calling this function to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity for item insertion operations.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity for item insertion operations.\n- `iron_mining_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity for fuel insertion operations.\n- `copper_mining_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity for fuel insertion operations."}
