{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0): This drill is fueled with coal and is actively mining iron ore. It has a warning indicating that its output is blocked by items on the ground, as there is no sink entity to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0): This furnace is fueled with coal and is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it currently has a warning indicating \"no ingredients to smelt,\" suggesting that it is not receiving iron ore from the mining drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing entities such as Stone Furnace, Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, and Transport Belt is unoccupied and valid. Verify the position before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specified positions\n- When using functions like `get_entity`, ensure that the specified position contains the expected entity type. If an entity is not found, double-check the position coordinates and ensure the entity exists at that location.\n\n### Output blockage and resource flow issues\n- Address the warning from the Burner Mining Drill regarding output blockage by ensuring there is a connected sink entity (such as a chest or transport belt) to accept the mined resources. This will prevent the drill from becoming inefficient due to blocked output.\n\n### Fuel and ingredient management in furnaces\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace receives the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Check the connections between the mining drill and the furnace to ensure a smooth flow of resources."}
