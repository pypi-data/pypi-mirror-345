{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied or Inaccessible Positions\n- Ensure there is no collision with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n- Verify that the target position is not on an inaccessible area like water.\n\n### Errors Due to Distance Limitations\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place entities. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 tiles.\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can successfully transfer items between entities.\n- Ensure that inserters are properly fueled and positioned to pick up and drop items correctly.\n\n### Chest and Furnace Issues\n- Regularly check and empty the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations.\n- Ensure the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting. Adjust inserter setups if the furnace is not receiving iron ore.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency of the setup can be improved, and resource processing can continue smoothly."}
