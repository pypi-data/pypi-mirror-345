Regularly check and replenish fuel supplies.\n\n- **Errors when using inserters**: \n  - Inserters may wait for source items or space in the destination. Make sure that there are sufficient items in the source and space available in the destination to avoid delays.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: \n  - Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the desired location.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - No specific utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution logs.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `stone_furnace_status`: str\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: str\n  - `burner_inserter_status`: str\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `current_inventory`: dict"}
