{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 4})\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (40,000 units)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is clear and suitable for placing the entity. Verify that there are no obstructions or existing entities at the desired location before attempting to place new entities like Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, or Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables in scripts\n- Double-check the script for any undefined variables or incorrect references. Ensure that all variables are properly declared and initialized before use. For example, the variable 'ore_furnace' was not defined, leading to a NameError.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For instance, ensure you have coal in your inventory before trying to insert it into a Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage\n- Address warnings about output being blocked by ensuring there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or another processing entity) to accept the output from drills or other production entities."}
