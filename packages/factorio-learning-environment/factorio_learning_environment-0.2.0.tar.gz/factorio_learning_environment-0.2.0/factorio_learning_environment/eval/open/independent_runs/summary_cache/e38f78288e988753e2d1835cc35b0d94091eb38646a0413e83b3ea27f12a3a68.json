The maximum distance for placing entities is not explicitly stated but is a limitation. Check for existing entities that might be blocking the placement and adjust the spacing or direction accordingly.\n* Errors when inserting items into an entity\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure all variables are defined before using them in your code. Check for typos and ensure that the variable is within the scope of the current execution context.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at an occupied position\n  - Ensure the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. Check the position and surrounding area for existing entities.\n* Errors when connecting entities directly without using an inserter\n  - Use an inserter to transfer items between entities like chests and furnaces instead of trying to connect them directly with transport belts.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity next to another entity with insufficient spacing\n  - Adjust the spacing or direction when placing entities next to each other to avoid collisions with existing entities. Consider removing or repositioning the blocking entity if necessary.\n* Errors when placing an inserter with incorrect direction or spacing\n  - Ensure the inserter is placed with the correct direction and spacing to reach the target entities. Adjust the inserter's pickup and drop positions as needed.\n* Errors when transport belt is blocked\n  - Ensure that the transport belt is clear of obstructions to allow for continuous item transfer. Check the belt for any items that might be blocking the flow and clear them if necessary.\n* Errors when rotating inserters without checking their current state\n  - Check the current state and configuration of the inserter before rotating it to avoid unexpected behavior.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity while being too far away\n  - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when removing items from the ground\n  - Be cautious when removing items from the ground as it may disrupt the production flow.\n* Errors when extracting items from an empty chest\n  - Ensure the target chest contains the required items before attempting to extract them. Check the chest's inventory before extraction.\n* Errors when attempting to connect a transport belt directly from a chest\n  - Use an inserter to transfer items from the chest to the transport belt.\n* Errors due to syntax errors or undefined keywords\n  - Ensure that the code is syntactically correct and that all keywords are properly defined.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n"}
