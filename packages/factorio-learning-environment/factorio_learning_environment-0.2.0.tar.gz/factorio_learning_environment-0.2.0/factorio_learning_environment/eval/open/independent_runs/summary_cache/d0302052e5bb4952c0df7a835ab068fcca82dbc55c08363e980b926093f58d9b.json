{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n\n#### Research Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5) connected to the power supply\n- Automation science packs inserted into the lab\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors in Research Setup\n- Ensure that the research prerequisites are met before attempting to set research. Verify that the lab has the necessary science packs and that the research is available.\n\n#### Errors with Lab Power Connection\n- Confirm that the lab is correctly connected to the power supply. Check the electrical network to ensure the lab receives power.\n\n#### Errors with Refueling Boiler\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel the boiler. Regularly check the fuel level and replenish as necessary to avoid power disruptions.\n\n#### Errors in Lab Functionality\n- After connecting the lab to power and inserting science packs, ensure that research is actively set and progressing. If the lab is not working, double-check the research settings and the lab's status."}
