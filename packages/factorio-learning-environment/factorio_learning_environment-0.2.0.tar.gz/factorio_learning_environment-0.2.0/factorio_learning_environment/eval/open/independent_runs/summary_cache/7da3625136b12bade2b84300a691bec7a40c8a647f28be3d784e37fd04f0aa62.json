{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=52.5, y=-80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=53.5, y=-80.5) connected to the drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) transferring items from the chest at (x=53.5, y=-80.5) to another chest at (x=52.5, y=-78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-78.5) receiving items from the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-76.5) waiting for source items, connected to the chest at (x=52.5, y=-77.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-77.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-11.5, y=-49.5), connected to a stone furnace and a wooden chest.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) transferring items from the chest at (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) waiting for source items, connected to a chest at (x=-13.5, y=-45.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest at Drop Position\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to source items and that the supply chain is not interrupted. Ensure that the items are available at the pickup positions of the inserters.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the given steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Current inventory includes items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n"}
