You need to add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.SteamEngine and use the inserter as the target entity.\u201d\n\u2003Tip: Before connecting a belt, verify that the designated target is a proper inserter (or similar interface) rather than a power generator such as a steam engine.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Issue\n\u2003Error: \u201cCould not place wooden-chest at (3.5, 15.5)\u2026 The target position is too far away\u2026 Move closer.\u201d\n\u2003Tip: Ensure that the player is within the maximum allowed distance for placement by moving closer to the intended target location.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Reference\n\u2003Error: \u201cNameError: name \u2018target_chest\u2019 is not defined\u2026 Did you mean one of these?
