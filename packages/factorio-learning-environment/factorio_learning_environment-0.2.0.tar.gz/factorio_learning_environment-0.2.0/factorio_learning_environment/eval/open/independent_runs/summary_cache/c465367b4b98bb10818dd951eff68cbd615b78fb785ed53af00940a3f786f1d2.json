{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore from the ground.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Reposition if necessary to maintain a clear path for item transfer.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is operational and correctly configured to transfer iron ore into the furnace. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that may prevent the transfer.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Mining Drill\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of the mining drill and ensure it is adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Chest Overcapacity Warnings\n- Monitor the inventory levels in the chest to prevent overcapacity. Empty the chest regularly to avoid mining interruptions.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has a consistent supply of iron ore to smelt. Check the inserter and chest setup to confirm that iron ore is being delivered to the furnace.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the agent can improve the efficiency of its iron ore processing operations and avoid interruptions in production."}
