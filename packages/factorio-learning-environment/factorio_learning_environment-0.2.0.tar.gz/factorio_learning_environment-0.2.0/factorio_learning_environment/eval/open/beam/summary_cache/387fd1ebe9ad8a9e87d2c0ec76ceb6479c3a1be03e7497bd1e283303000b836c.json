{"content": "The error indicates that there is no nearby power source, specifically a \"small-electric-pole,\" available on the surface. To resolve this, you need to place a new power source to power the assembling machine. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n### Steps to Power the Assembling Machine:\n\n1. **Craft a Small Electric Pole**: Ensure you have the necessary materials to craft a small electric pole.\n2. **Place the Electric Pole**: Place the electric pole near the assembling machine to provide power.\n3. **Connect the Pole to a Power Source**: If there is no existing power network, you will need to create one by placing additional poles connected to a power source like a steam engine or solar panel.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check if you can craft a Small Electric Pole\nrequired_wood = 2  # Small Electric Pole requires wood\nrequired_copper_cable = 2  # Small Electric Pole requires copper cable\n\n# Check inventory for required materials\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\ncurrent_wood = inventory.get(Prototype.Wood, 0)\ncurrent_copper_cable = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0)\n\n# Craft copper cables if needed\nif current_copper_cable < required_copper_cable:\n    craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, required_copper_cable - current_copper_cable)\n    print(\"Crafted additional Copper Cables.\")\n\n# Ensure you have enough wood\nif current_wood < required_wood:\n    print(\"Insufficient wood to craft Small Electric Pole.
