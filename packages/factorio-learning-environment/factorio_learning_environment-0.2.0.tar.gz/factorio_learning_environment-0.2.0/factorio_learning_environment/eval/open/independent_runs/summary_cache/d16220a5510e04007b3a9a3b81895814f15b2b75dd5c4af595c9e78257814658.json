{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-21.0, y=-62.0) with coal fuel and copper ore input, producing copper plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Setup at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, y=-68.0) with no fuel, connected to a chest at drop position (-23.5, y=-69.5) which is full of copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, y=-53.0) fueled by coal, extracting iron ore into a chest at position (-14.5, y=-54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items from the chest to another chest at position (-12.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, y=0.0) with coal fuel, currently lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Chest at position (1.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, transferring between chests at positions (1.5, y=0.5) and (3.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Entity Name Error\n- Ensure that all entity names are correctly defined in the code. For example, use 'burner_mining_drill' instead of 'BurnerMiningDrill' to avoid NameError.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and configured to access the source items.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests Blocking Operations\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent blocking mining operations. Ensure there is a sink entity or storage available to receive the output from mining drills.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with the required ores to maintain continuous production."}
