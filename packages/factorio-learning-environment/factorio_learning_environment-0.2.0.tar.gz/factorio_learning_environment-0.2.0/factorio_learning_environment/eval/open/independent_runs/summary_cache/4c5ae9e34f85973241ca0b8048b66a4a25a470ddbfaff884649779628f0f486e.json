{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests have failed, resulting in no entities being successfully placed or constructed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors with moving to a position\n- Ensure that the position coordinates are correctly formatted as integers. Avoid using strings or other data types that are not compatible with position coordinates.\n\n### Errors with BuildingBox size\n- When defining a BuildingBox for placement, ensure that the dimensions are correctly specified using appropriate data types. If the BuildingBox is too large for the available space, consider using smaller BuildingBoxes or adjusting the size to fit the available area.\n\n### Errors with placing entities\n- Verify that the target position for placing entities such as Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests is valid and unoccupied. Ensure that there is enough space for the entity to be placed.\n- If encountering repeated placement failures, reassess the chosen positions and ensure they are suitable for the intended entities.\n\n### Errors with data type conversion\n- When converting data types, ensure that the source data is compatible with the target type. For instance, when using the `int()` function, the input must be a string, bytes-like object, or a real number. Avoid using incompatible types such as `ModelPrivateAttr`."}
