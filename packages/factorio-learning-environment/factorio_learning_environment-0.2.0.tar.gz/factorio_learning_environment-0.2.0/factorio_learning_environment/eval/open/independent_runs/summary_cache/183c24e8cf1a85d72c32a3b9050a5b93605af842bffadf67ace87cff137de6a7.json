{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (39,998 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Transport Belt Placement**: Ensure that the desired location for placing a transport belt is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n- **Wooden Chest Placement**: Verify that the location where you intend to place a wooden chest is not already occupied by another entity.\n- **Burner Inserter Placement**: Before placing a burner inserter, confirm that the target location is valid and unoccupied.\n\n### Errors with Moving Entities\n- **Stone Furnace Movement**: Confirm that the new location for moving the stone furnace is valid and not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors with Entity Retrieval\n- **Stone Furnace Retrieval**: Ensure that the position specified for retrieving a stone furnace indeed contains a stone furnace entity. Double-check coordinates to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Clearing Drill's Drop Position**: Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to prevent blockages and ensure continuous operation.\n- **Inventory Management**: Keep track of inventory items to ensure that there are enough resources for construction and operation of entities."}
