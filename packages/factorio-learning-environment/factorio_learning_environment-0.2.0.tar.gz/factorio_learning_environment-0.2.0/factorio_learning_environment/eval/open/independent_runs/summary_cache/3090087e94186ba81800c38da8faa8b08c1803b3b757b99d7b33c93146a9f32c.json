{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore due to incorrect inserter setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to pick up items from the source (wooden chest) and drop them into the target (furnace). Verify that the pickup and drop positions are correctly set.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- When placing entities such as inserters, ensure there is no collision with existing entities or terrain features like water. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position for placement."}
