{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all necessary entities, such as mining drills and inserters, to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Production\n- Verify that the furnace has the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to produce iron plates. Regularly check and ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and functioning to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Full Chest\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining process."}
