{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: 4 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the desired location is free of other entities before placing a new entity. This includes checking for existing entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- Verify that the destination location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity such as a Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the coordinates and the type of entity you are trying to access.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Keep track of your inventory to ensure you have the necessary resources, such as coal, before attempting to insert them into entities like drills.\n\n### Warnings about blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage and inefficiency.\n\n### Warnings about missing ingredients\n- Make sure that furnaces and other processing entities have the necessary ingredients to process, avoiding idle time and inefficiencies."}
