For example, a stone furnace or wooden chest must be crafted or acquired before placement.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For instance, ensure you have coal before trying to fuel a mining drill.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Make sure all sub-ingredients are available before crafting complex items. For example, ensure you have enough iron plates and iron gear wheels when crafting a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an entity with no valid contents\n- Confirm that the entity contains the items you wish to extract. For instance, check that there is iron ore in the chest before attempting to extract it."}
