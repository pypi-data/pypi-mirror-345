{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump:\n  - Pipe at position (x=1.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe-to-ground at position (x=16.5, y=17.5)\n  - Various other pipes forming a network to transport steam and water\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 27187) carrying steam, starting at position (x=9.5, y=15.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 27197) currently empty, starting at position (x=6.5, y=21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 27199) carrying water, starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=49149) with poles at various positions including (x=10.5, y=13.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), and others, providing power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and within the connection range to successfully connect entities. Double-check the start and end positions for connectivity.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel boilers and other fuel-dependent entities. Regularly check fuel levels to prevent interruptions in operations.\n\n### Errors in Inserting Items\n- Verify that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent failed insertions due to missing items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect two positions with specified pipe prototypes. Ensure that the positions are valid and within range for successful connections.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of connected pipe entities, used to manage fluid transportation.\n- `boiler`: Represents the boiler entity, requiring regular refueling with coal.\n- `steam-engine`: Represents the steam engine entity, connected to the pipe network for power generation."}
