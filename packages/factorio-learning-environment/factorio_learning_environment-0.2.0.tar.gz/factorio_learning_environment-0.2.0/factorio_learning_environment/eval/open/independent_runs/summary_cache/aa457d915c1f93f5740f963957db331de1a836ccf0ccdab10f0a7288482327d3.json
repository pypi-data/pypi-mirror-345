{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to:\n  - Wooden Chests at Positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for ore storage.\n  - Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring ore from chests to:\n  - Stone Furnace at Position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Additional Stone Furnace at Position (-10.0, -48.0) currently not in use due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests for storing iron plates:\n  - Chest at Position (-6.5, -49.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n  - Chest at Position (-6.5, -48.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n  - Chest at Position (-7.5, -48.5) with 60 iron plates.\n  - Chest at Position (-5.5, -48.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n  - Chest at Position (-4.5, -48.5) with 62 iron plates.\n  - Chest at Position (-3.5, -48.5) is empty.\n\n### Iron Ore and Plate Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserters for transferring materials:\n  - Inserter at Position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items from chests to other entities.\n  - Inserter at Position (-11.5, -46.5) transferring items between furnaces.\n  - Inserter at Position (-8.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, connected to a stone furnace and chests.\n  - Inserter at Position (-11.5, -45.5) part of the transfer system between inserters.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items by checking the inventory of connected entities and ensuring they are not empty.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Always check your inventory for available fuel before attempting to refuel entities. Ensure you have sufficient coal or other fuel types in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Misaligned\n- Regularly realign inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items as intended. This can prevent bottlenecks in your production line.\n\n### Errors when Attempting to Insert Items without Inventory\n- Verify that the items you wish to insert are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities."}
