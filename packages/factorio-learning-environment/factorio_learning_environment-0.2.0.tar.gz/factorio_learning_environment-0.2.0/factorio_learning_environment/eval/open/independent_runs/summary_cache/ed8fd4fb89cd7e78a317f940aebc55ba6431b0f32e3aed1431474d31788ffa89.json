{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler requires water and fuel to generate steam, which powers the steam engine for electricity generation.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) which extracts coal.\n- Several wooden chests (positions 46.5, -83.5; 48.5, -83.5; 5.5, -79.5; 10.5, -79.5) for storage.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient pipes\n- Ensure to have enough pipes in inventory before attempting to connect the Boiler to the Steam Engine. Check inventory regularly and craft pipes as needed.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Cannot place Offshore Pump as it is not in inventory. Always check your inventory before attempting to place any entity.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target positions."}
