{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel, while the offshore pump is operational and supplying water.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) that is currently processing copper ore.\n\n### Iron plate mine at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0) that is currently processing iron ore.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nThe lab is currently not powered and is connected to an electric pole at the same position.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nThe assembling machine is currently not powered and is connected to an electric pole at position (-19.5, 23.5).\n\n### PipeGroup for water supply at position(-11.5, 20.5)\nThis pipe group is part of the fluid system supplying water from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### ElectricityGroup at position(-17.5, 21.5)\nThis group consists of several small electric poles that are intended to supply power to nearby structures.\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) that is currently not receiving electricity.\n\n### PipeGroup for additional fluid systems at position(-4.5, 21.5)\nThis pipe group is currently empty and not in use.\n\n### PipeGroup for additional fluid systems at position(-4.5, 23.5)\nThis pipe group is currently empty and not in use.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an electric pole. Check positions (-17.5, 23.5) and (-19.5, 23.5) for obstructions.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- The lab at position (-17.5, 23.5) and the assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) are not receiving electricity. Ensure that electric poles are placed correctly and are not obstructed to provide power to these entities.\n\n### Errors when using assert statements\n- The assertion error indicates that the lab is not powered. Ensure that all connected electric poles are functional and that there are no issues with the power supply.\n\n### General tips for entity placement\n- Always verify that the area is clear and that the intended position for any new entity is valid before placing it."}
