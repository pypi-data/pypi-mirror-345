Verify the target entity type before attempting any belt connection.\n\u2013 For placement actions, ensure the player is within the maximum allowed distance. In cases where placement fails because the target position is too far (e.g. target distance 15.89 exceeds a max of 10), move closer prior to placing the entity.\n\u2013 Confirm that the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting a placement; missing inventory items (such as a wooden chest) will cause placement errors.\n\u2013 Validate all variable references before use. For example, ensure that variables like \u201ctarget_chest\u201d are properly defined to avoid NameErrors.\n\n"}
