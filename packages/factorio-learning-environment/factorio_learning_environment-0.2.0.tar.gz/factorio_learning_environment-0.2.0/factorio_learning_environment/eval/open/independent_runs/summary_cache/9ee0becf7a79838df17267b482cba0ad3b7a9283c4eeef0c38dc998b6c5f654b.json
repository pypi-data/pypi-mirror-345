Repeated attempts to craft and place the Lab have failed due to inventory shortages and unmet crafting dependencies. As a result, no Lab structure exists on the map.\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nReferenced for converting iron ore into iron plates. This pre\u2010existing furnace is used during the smelting operations; no additional components were assembled into a larger structure.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position (-27.0, -60.0)\nReferenced for converting copper ore into copper plates. This furnace provided the facility for copper plate production, with resources inserted and output extracted, but no new compound structure was built.\n\nNote: Despite utilizing these production facilities for resource processing, the final map state shows no newly placed entities.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval  \n\u2003\u2013 Avoid using unsupported keywords (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or positional arguments with get_entities; adhere strictly to the function\u2019s defined signature.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement without confirming inventory  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting placement to prevent \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Unhandled non-iterable returns  \n\u2003\u2013 When processing the result of get_entities, ensure the value is iterable (e.g. fallback to an empty list if None) to avoid iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Incomplete resource chain for Lab crafting  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all intermediate ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available.
