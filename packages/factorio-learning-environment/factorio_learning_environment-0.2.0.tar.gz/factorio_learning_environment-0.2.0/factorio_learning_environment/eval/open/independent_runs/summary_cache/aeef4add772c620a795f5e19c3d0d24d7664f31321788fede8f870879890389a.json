{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area (x=0-6, y=0-4)\nConsists of 4 stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0)  \n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n### Research Lab (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nSingle lab structure for conducting research, currently researching automation technology\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5 to x=4.5, y=21.5-24.5)\nComplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipe network between components\n- Small electric poles connecting power to lab\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without required raw materials\n- Ensure you have all required raw materials before attempting to craft items\n- For items requiring smelting (like iron/copper plates), make sure to smelt the ore first in furnaces\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Craft or acquire the required entity before attempting to place it\n- Check inventory to confirm you have the item before placement\n\n### Errors when trying to connect entities without connection items\n- Ensure you have required connection items (like pipes) in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Craft the connection items first if needed\n\n### Errors with incorrect recipe dependencies\n- Some items require crafting intermediate products first\n- Check full recipe requirements including sub-components before starting crafting\n\n### Errors with power system setup\n- Ensure all power system components are properly connected\n- Power poles must be placed to create complete electrical network\n- Steam engines require water flow and boiler steam generation to function\n\n### Type errors in building calculations\n- Building dimensions should be accessed directly rather than through prototype attributes\n- Use proper numeric values for building placement calculations"}
