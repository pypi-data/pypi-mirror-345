{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes and small electric poles\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Storage and Miscellaneous\n- Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing various items\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with no research in progress, located near the storage area\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups for fluid transport, primarily for water and steam distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Refueling without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Check for placement blockages before attempting to connect entities like electric poles. Ensure there is a clear path for connections.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full drop positions.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly supply them with raw materials to maintain production."}
