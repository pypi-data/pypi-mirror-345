{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which is responsible for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which is intended to smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace. Repeated checks and repositioning indicate persistent alignment issues.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal to refuel the inserter and mining drill. Running out of coal can halt operations.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Coal cannot be crafted as it is a raw resource that must be gathered. Avoid attempting to craft coal and instead focus on gathering it from coal deposits.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can stop the mining drill from functioning."}
