{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a status of `NO_INGREDIENTS`, fueled by coal. It currently has 63 iron plates in its result inventory.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) facing downwards, fueled by coal, with a warning that the output is blocked by an item on the ground. It is working but lacks a sink entity to accept the output. The drill is extracting coal with a resource count of 40,000.\n\n### Storage Facility at Position (200.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (200.5, -80.5) with an empty inventory and a status of `NORMAL`.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Transport Belt Connection\n- Ensure that the destination position for the transport belt is valid and unoccupied before attempting to connect belts. Multiple failed attempts were made to connect transport belts from position (42.5, -81.5) to various destinations, indicating potential issues with the target positions being invalid or obstructed.\n\n### Errors in Placing Burner Inserter\n- Verify that the intended position for placing a Burner Inserter is free and suitable for placement. Several attempts to place Burner Inserters failed due to unsuitable positions.\n\n### Errors in Placing Wooden Chest\n- Check that the position where you intend to place a Wooden Chest is not already occupied by another entity or obstructed. Multiple placement attempts failed due to occupied or invalid positions.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drill\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage and maintain efficient operation."}
