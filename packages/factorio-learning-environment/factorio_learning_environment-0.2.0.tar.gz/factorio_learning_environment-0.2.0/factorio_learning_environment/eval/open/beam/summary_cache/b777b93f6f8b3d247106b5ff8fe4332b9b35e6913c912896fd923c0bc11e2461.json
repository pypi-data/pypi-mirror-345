Once the first furnace finishes processing its remaining iron ore, we will need to gather more iron ore to keep production going.\n2. We should also consider inserting more iron ore into the second furnace once we have gathered enough.\n\nLet\u2019s wait briefly to see how many more iron plates the first furnace produces after processing its remaining iron ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the first furnace to process its iron ore\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration if needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-120]"}
