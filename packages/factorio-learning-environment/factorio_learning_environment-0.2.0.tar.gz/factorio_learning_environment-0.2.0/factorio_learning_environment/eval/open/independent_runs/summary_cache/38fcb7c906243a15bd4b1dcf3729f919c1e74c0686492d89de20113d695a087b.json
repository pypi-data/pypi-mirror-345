No new engine was added to the structure, and efforts later shifted toward crafting a replacement \u2013 which also faced resource-related setbacks.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Steam Engine Placement Failures (Directional & Spacing Issues)\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple attempts using direction DOWN (with spacing values 1 and 2), RIGHT, and LEFT failed due to collisions with pre-existing pipe layouts, nearby generators, trees, or other blocking entities.\n\u2003\u2003Tip: Always pre-check candidate coordinates and verify clearances (using buildability or bounding box feedback) before issuing placement commands. Adjust spacing and direction to avoid collisions.\n\n\u2022 Misuse of Buildable Area Attributes\n\u2003\u2013 An error occurred when accessing the center of the buildable area (\u201c'Position' object is not callable\u201d), indicating that the center property was called as a function.\n\u2003\u2003Tip: Access object properties correctly (e.g., using .center without parentheses if it is a property) to avoid type errors.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and Inventory Deficiencies\n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to craft a steam engine failed due to insufficient sub-ingredients \u2013 notably, the inability to automatically produce enough iron-plates (the recipe requires a crafting machine or furnace smelting) and later, an insufficient count of iron-plates (required amounts of 2\u20133 per engine).\n\u2003\u2003Tip: Ensure that production chains for intermediate items (such as iron-plates, iron-gear wheels, and pipes) are operating at sufficient capacity and that the inventory meets the recipe requirements before initiating a craft command.\n\n\u2022 General API and Collision Feedback\n\u2003\u2013 Error messages indicate that placement functions rejected positions because of both terrain restrictions (e.g., water) and collisions with other entities.\n\u2003\u2003Tip: Incorporate pre-placement clearance checks and validate candidate positions using environmental feedback prior to placement attempts."}
