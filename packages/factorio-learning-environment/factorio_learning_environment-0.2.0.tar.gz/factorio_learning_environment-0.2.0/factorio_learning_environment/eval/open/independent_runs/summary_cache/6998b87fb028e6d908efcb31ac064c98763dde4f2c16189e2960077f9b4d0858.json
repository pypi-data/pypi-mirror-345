{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt. It currently holds 60 iron plates.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) and another at position (16.5, 0.5), both currently not receiving electricity. These inserters are intended to transfer items between a wooden chest at position (18.5, 0.5) and the stone furnace.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of:\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 19.5) and another at position (-8.5, 23.5), both currently empty and not successfully connected to the power infrastructure.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles distributed across various positions, including (5.5, 21.5), (-16.5, 25.5), and (1.5, 25.5), but currently with no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Power Infrastructure Setup\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) and the boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0). Verify that all connections are valid and that the pipes are properly aligned.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Power to Inserters\n- Confirm the presence of a steam engine at position (3.0, 27.5) before attempting to connect power. If the steam engine is missing, place it correctly to ensure power distribution.\n\n### Errors in Placing Mining Drills\n- Verify that the intended position for placing mining drills is not occupied and is suitable for placement. Adjust the position or clear the area if necessary.\n\n### Errors in Mining Drill Setup\n- When setting up mining drills, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. Consider using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if space is constrained.\n\n### Errors in Data Handling\n- Address issues with string indices and ensure that data types are correctly handled during operations to prevent errors related to string indices."}
