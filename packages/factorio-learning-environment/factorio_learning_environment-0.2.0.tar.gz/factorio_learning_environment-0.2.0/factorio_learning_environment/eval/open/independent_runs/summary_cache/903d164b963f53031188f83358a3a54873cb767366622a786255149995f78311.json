{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a wooden chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0) connected to a wooden chest at Position (19.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (9.5, 5.5) feeding into the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) to the assembling machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storage\n- Inserters at Positions (-3.5, 1.5), (7.5, 5.5), and (9.5, 5.5) for item movement\n- BeltGroup for item transport between different structures\n\n### Pipe and Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- PipeGroups for water and steam transport\n- ElectricityGroup with poles connecting various entities for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the positions and directions of pipes are correctly aligned to connect entities such as offshore pumps and boilers. Verify that the pipe network is complete and correctly routed to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are available for production processes. For example, the assembling machine requires copper plates to produce copper cables. Keep track of inventory levels and replenish resources as needed.\n\n### Errors When Inserters Are Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available and within reach of the inserters. Adjust the position of inserters or ensure that the supply chain is not disrupted to prevent inserters from idling."}
