Check the pickup and drop positions for accuracy.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Check for existing objects that may obstruct the placement.\n\n### Errors due to distance limitations\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity if the target is too far away. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n### Inventory Errors\n- Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, ensure you have a wooden chest in your inventory before trying to place one."}
