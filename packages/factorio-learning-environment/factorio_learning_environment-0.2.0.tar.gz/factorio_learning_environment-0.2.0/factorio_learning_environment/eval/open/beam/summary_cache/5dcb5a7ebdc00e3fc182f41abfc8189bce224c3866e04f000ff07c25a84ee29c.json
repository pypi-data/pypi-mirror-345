{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to insert Copper Ore into the active furnace has failed due to an error indicating that the furnace already contains stone. This suggests that the furnace has not cleared its previous state and is currently unable to accept additional items.\n\n### Current Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace contains **3 pieces of stone** and is in a **\"WORKING\"** state, but it is not processing any items.\n- The error message indicates that the furnace cannot accept Copper Ore while it still has stone loaded.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not processing because it is likely configured to smelt stone into another product, and it cannot accept Copper Ore until the stone is removed.\n- The furnace needs to be reset to clear the stone before I can proceed with the Copper Ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Stone from the Furnace**: I will need to remove the stone from the active furnace to reset its state.\n2. **Reinsert Copper Ore**: After clearing the stone, I can then insert the Copper Ore for smelting.\n3. **Monitor the Smelting Operation**: Finally, observe if the furnace begins processing the Copper Ore after the reset.\n\nLet's proceed by extracting the stone from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Extract all 3 pieces of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-332]"}
