{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 22.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities, including:\n  - Pipe at positions (-2.5, 20.5), (-3.5, 20.5), (-0.5, 20.5), (-1.5, 20.5)\n  - PipeGroup with fluid system 22101, carrying water, at positions (-6.5, 23.5), (-5.5, 22.5), (-5.5, 23.5), (-6.5, 24.5), (-7.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0) with varying statuses and inventories.\n- Wooden Chests for storage at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5), (8.5, 1.5), (17.5, 1.5), and (19.5, 1.5).\n- Burner Inserters facilitating item movement between chests and furnaces at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at an unspecified position, currently not conducting research.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that all pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and the steam engine. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that may prevent successful connections.\n\n### Errors When Retrieving Entities\n- Verify the presence of entities at specified positions before attempting to retrieve them using the API. Ensure that the entity type and position are correct to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items\n- Confirm that the inventory contains the items you intend to insert into other entities. Ensure that the source inventory has sufficient quantity before attempting the insertion operation."}
