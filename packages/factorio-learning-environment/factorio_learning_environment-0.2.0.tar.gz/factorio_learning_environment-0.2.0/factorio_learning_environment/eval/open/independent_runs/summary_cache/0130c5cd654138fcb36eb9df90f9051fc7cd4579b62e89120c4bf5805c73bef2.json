{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) facing DOWN with drop position (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n- System status: drill not working (no fuel)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-20.5, -71.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest at (-20.5, -71.5) containing 2 copper ore\n- Original drill still needs replacement\n\n### Coal Mining Attempt at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing RIGHT with drop position (42.5, -82.5)\n- System status: drill not working (no fuel)\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 15.5) facing UP\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) (out of fuel, contains 200 units of water at 15\u00b0)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting components:\n  - Empty pipe group at (-14.5, 12.5)\n  - Water-filled pipe group at (-16.5, 19.5)\n  - Empty pipe group at (-9.5, 20.5)\n  - Empty pipe group at (5.5, 25.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting broader system\nSystem status:\n- Steam engine not receiving electricity\n- Boiler out of fuel\n- Offshore pump working\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab at (10.5, 0.5) containing 15 automation science packs\n- Currently researching logistics technology\n- No power due to steam engine issues\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Verify position is clear before placing new entities\n- When replacing entities, ensure proper removal of old entity first\n- Ensure proper alignment between drills and their output chests\n\n### Resource Extraction Issues\n- Cannot extract from drill's burner inventory directly\n- When mining resources directly, ensure proper positioning within reach\n- Verify resource is within harvesting radius before attempting to harvest\n- Harvested resources may not appear in inventory immediately - need proper handling\n\n### Fuel Insertion Issues\n- Cannot insert items into entities without being next to them\n- Stone cannot be used as fuel in burner mining drills or boilers\n- Ensure you are within reach distance when attempting to insert fuel\n- Moving to different positions around the entity does not help if the entity itself is not accepting fuel\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in all fuel-consuming entities\n- Current critical issue: All drills and boiler have no fuel\n- Ensure proper fuel type is being used for each machine\n- Coal cannot be crafted from other resources\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Steam engine not receiving electricity due to no fuel in boiler\n- Monitor fluid connections between power system components\n- Address \"no input liquid\" warnings in steam engine\n\n### API Usage Issues\n- Ensure proper attribute access when working with positions\n- Handle nil values appropriately in recipe and crafting operations\n- Verify entity existence and proximity before attempting insert operations\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to use items\n\n### Research Issues\n- Cannot start already researched technologies\n- Monitor research progress for currently researching technology"}
