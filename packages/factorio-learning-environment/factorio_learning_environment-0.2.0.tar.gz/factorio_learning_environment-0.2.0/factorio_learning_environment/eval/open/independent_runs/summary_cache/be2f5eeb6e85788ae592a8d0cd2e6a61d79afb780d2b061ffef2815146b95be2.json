{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Ensure that you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Spaces\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if there are existing entities or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water) that may block placement.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can successfully transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning correctly, leading to resource blockages.\n\n### Errors Due to Empty or Low Inventory\n- Regularly check the inventory levels of chests and furnaces to ensure they are adequately stocked with necessary resources. An empty or low inventory can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors Due to Inserter Fuel Shortage\n- Keep inserters fueled with coal or other suitable fuel to maintain their operation. An inserter without fuel will not function, leading to process disruptions.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency and functionality of your structures can be significantly improved."}
