{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Burner Inserter Placement**: Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location. Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place a Burner Inserter.\n- **Wooden Chest Placement**: Cannot place Wooden Chest at the drill's drop position. Verify that the drop position is clear and not obstructed by other items or entities before placing a Wooden Chest.\n- **Transport Belt Placement**: Cannot place Transport Belt at the desired location. Confirm that the placement area is free from obstructions and that the belt can connect to the intended path.\n\n### Errors when accessing entities\n- **Stone Furnace Access**: Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at specified positions. Ensure that the Stone Furnace exists at the given coordinates before attempting to access or interact with it.\n\n### Output Blockage\n- **Burner Mining Drill Output Blockage**: The output of the Burner Mining Drill is blocked by an item on the ground. Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### General Tips\n- Always verify the existence and correct placement of entities before attempting to interact with them.\n- Regularly check for obstructions and clear any items blocking the output paths of drills and other machinery to maintain efficient operation."}
