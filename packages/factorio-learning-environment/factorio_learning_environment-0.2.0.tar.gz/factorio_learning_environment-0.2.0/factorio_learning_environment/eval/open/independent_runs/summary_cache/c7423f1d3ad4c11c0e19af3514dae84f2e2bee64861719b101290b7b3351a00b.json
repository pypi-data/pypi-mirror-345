{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully placed on the map during this execution run. Attempts to position a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) were made but failed due to unavailable lab inventory and unmet resource requirements. While pre\u2010existing smelting facilities were referenced (an alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) for iron plate processing and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper plate production), no new permanent construction was created.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Consistency\n\u2003\u2013 When invoking get_entities, ensure that the function is called with the appropriate parameters. Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or positional arguments if none are accepted.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the lab entity is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable, and copper-plate) are available before attempting to craft a Lab.\n\u2003\u2013 When filtering retrieved entities, ensure that the value is iterable (using a fallback for None if necessary) to prevent type errors.\n\u2022 Resource Chain Validation\n\u2003\u2013 Check that all intermediate production steps (e.g. smelting iron ore to iron-plate, producing copper cables from copper plates) are fully supported by existing crafting or smelting facilities before initiating lab production."}
