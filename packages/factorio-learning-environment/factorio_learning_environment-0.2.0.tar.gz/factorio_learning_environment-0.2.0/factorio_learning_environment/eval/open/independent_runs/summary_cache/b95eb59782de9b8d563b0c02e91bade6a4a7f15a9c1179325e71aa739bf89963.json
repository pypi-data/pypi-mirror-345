{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area (Position x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Main furnace at (0.0, 0.0) - Currently has coal fuel and iron plate output\n- Secondary furnace at (2.0, 0.0) - Has coal fuel but no active smelting\n\n### Copper Smelting Area (Position x=4.0, y=4.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Main furnace at (4.0, 4.0) - Has coal fuel and copper plate output\n- Secondary furnace at (6.0, 4.0) - Has coal fuel but no active smelting\n\n### Inserter Assembly Line (Position x=23.5, y=2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at (23.5, 2.5) configured to craft inserters\n- Input burner inserter at (21.5, 2.5) facing left\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 2.5) facing left\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 2.5) containing 132 inserters\n- Output wooden chest at (26.5, 2.5)\n\n### Power Generation System\nComponents:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Connected pipe networks for water and steam transfer\n- Electric pole network connecting multiple structures\n\n### Research Lab Complex\nMultiple labs in various states:\n- 2 labs with automation and logistic science packs\n- 2 labs with only automation science packs\n- Several unpowered or empty labs\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting crafting operations\n- Keep track of iron plate and iron ore levels to maintain continuous smelting\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler to prevent power outages\n- Add fuel to boiler before it runs completely empty\n\n### Assembly Line Problems\n- Verify all required components (iron plate, iron gear wheel, electronic circuit) are available before starting assembly\n- Ensure proper inserter orientation between chests and assembling machine\n\n### Resource Shortage Handling\n- Maintain minimum stock levels of basic resources (coal, iron ore)\n- Implement better resource gathering cycles to prevent production stoppages\n\n### Crafting Dependencies\n- Consider the full crafting chain when planning production\n- Ensure intermediate products (iron plates) are available before attempting to craft items that require them"}
