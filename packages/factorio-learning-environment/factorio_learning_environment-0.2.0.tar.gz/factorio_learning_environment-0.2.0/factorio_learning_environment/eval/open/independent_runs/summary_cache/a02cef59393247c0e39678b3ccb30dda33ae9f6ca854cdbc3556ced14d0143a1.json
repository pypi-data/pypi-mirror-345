{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20, -70)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0), fueled with coal, currently without ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0), fueled with coal, currently without ingredients to smelt and with full output of iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-23, -68)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0), out of fuel, connected to a series of transport belts and wooden chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to storage chests.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14, -54)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0), out of fuel, connected to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5), waiting for source items, connected to the mining drill and chest.\n\n### Centralized Storage and Processing Hub at Position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), fueled with coal, with full output of iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5), waiting for source items, connected to the storage chests.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n- Various other wooden chests at positions (-16.5, -64.5), (-14.5, -64.5), (-20.5, -63.5), (-13.5, -61.5), (-14.5, -54.5), (-3.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using undefined entities\n- Ensure that all entities used in the code are properly defined and imported. For example, the error \"NameError: name 'BurnerMiningDrill' is not defined\" suggests that the entity was not correctly referenced. Verify the correct entity name and import path, such as 'factorio_entities.BurnerMiningDrill'.\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Regularly check the fuel status of burner mining drills and ensure they are refueled to avoid production halts. This can be automated by setting up a logistic system to supply fuel continuously.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items by checking their pickup and drop positions. Adjust the logistics or supply chain to ensure continuous item flow to the inserters."}
