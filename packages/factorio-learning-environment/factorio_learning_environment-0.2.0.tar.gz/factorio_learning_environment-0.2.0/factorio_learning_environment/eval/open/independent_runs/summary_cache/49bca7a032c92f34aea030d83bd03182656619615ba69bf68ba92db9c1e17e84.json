{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0), extracting coal and dropping it into a chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) storing coal extracted by the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5), currently empty.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5), ready to transfer items from the chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Inventory of the furnace includes iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting various points with coal inventory and status working.\n- Belts connecting positions (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5), (x=49.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5), (x=43.5, y=-84.5) to (x=45.5, y=-84.5), (x=45.5, y=-85.5) to (x=47.5, y=-85.5), and (x=52.5, y=-83.5) to (x=52.5, y=-85.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory in Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to full inventory.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operations\n- Verify that inserters have a clear path and are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure that the source and destination entities have available space for the transfer."}
