{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### First Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a full inventory of coal (50/50) and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Patch at position (-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron ore (not explicitly represented as an entity but referenced for harvesting).\n\n### Additional Furnaces\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with a full inventory of coal (47/50) and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone furnace (position 4.0, 0.0) with a full inventory of coal (50/50) and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone furnace (position 6.0, 0.0) with a low inventory of coal (3/50) and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (8.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 8.5, 0.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. The furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) has a full inventory of coal, preventing further insertion.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items from an empty inventory\n- Make sure to gather the required items (e.g., iron ore) before attempting to insert them into the furnace. The agent encountered errors when trying to insert iron ore without having any in inventory.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. The agent should ensure proximity to the iron ore patch when harvesting.\n\n### Repeated errors with coal insertion\n- The agent repeatedly faced issues inserting coal into the furnace. Check the inventory of the furnace before attempting to add coal, as it may already be full."}
