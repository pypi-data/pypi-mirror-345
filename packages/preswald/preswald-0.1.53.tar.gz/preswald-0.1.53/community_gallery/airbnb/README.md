# Preswald Airbnb Market Intelligence Dashboard

## Overview
This interactive dashboard provides comprehensive insights into San Francisco's Airbnb market, helping users understand pricing trends, neighborhood dynamics, and host behaviors. The application is built with Preswald, enabling rapid development of an interactive, data-driven web application without the complexity of traditional full-stack development.

## How to Run

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   ```bash
   # Install Preswald and other libraries
   pip install preswald pandas numpy matplotlib plotly scikit-learn

   # Create a new project directory
   preswald init airbnb_dashboard
   cd airbnb_dashboard
   ```

2. **Configure Data Source**
   Create a `preswald.toml` file in your project directory with the following content:
   ```toml
   [data.airbnb]
   path = "./data/airbnb.csv"
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**
   Download the San Francisco Airbnb dataset from Inside Airbnb and save it as `airbnb.csv` in a `data` folder in your project directory.

4. **Run the App Locally**
   ```bash
   preswald run hello.py
   ```
   This will start a local development server, and you can access the dashboard at the URL shown in the terminal.
