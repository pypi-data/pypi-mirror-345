{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) and another Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) with pickup at (53.5, -83.5) and drop at (55.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) containing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) with pickup at (41.5, -79.5) and drop at (41.5, -81.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Iron and Coal Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) containing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs and status of \"NO_POWER\".\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup (Incomplete)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5) with a warning of \"no fluid present in connections\".\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0) with warnings of \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\".\n\n### Conveyor Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs, including belts at positions (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5) and (x=49.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that the inventory of entities like stone furnaces is not full before attempting to insert items. Regularly check and clear inventories to prevent insertion failures.\n\n### Resource Availability Errors\n- Make sure to gather necessary raw resources like stone before crafting items that require them as sub-ingredients.\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities like boilers or steam engines, ensure that the target position is within reach and not obstructed by other entities or unplaceable terrain.\n- Move closer to the target position if it is too far away to place the entity.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to connect entities, such as pipes for connecting offshore pumps to boilers.\n\n### Entity Retrieval Errors\n- Verify the existence of entities like steam engines at specified positions before attempting to retrieve them. If they do not exist, craft or place them as needed."}
