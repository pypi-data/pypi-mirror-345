{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the boiler and steam engine with pipes at positions such as (-5.5, 16.5), (-4.5, 16.5), and (-2.5, 22.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for water transport from the offshore pump with pipes at positions like (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), and (-4.5, 24.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variable Errors\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, `steam_engine_buildable_area` was not defined before being used.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- Avoid using incompatible types in calculations. For instance, adding `ModelPrivateAttr` and `int` is unsupported. Ensure types are compatible for arithmetic operations.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Verify inventory for required ingredients before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting a steam engine failed due to missing iron plates and iron gear wheels.\n- Ensure that crafting machines or furnaces are available for items that require them, like iron plates.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Ensure that the necessary items are in the inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, placing a steam engine failed due to its absence in the inventory.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For instance, connecting pipes failed due to a lack of pipes in the inventory.\n\n### Fuel Insertion Errors\n- Check inventory for fuel before attempting to insert it into entities like boilers. Errors occurred when trying to insert coal without having it in the inventory."}
