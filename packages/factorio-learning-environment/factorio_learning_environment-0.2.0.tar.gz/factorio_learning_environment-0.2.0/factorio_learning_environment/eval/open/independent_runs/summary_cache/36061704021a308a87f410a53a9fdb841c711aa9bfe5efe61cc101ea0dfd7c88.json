{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=40.0, y=-84.0) with a status of WORKING, connected to a Burner Inserter at Position(x=40.5, y=-82.5) which is WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION.\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS, currently holding 75 iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup with inputs at Position(x=50.5, y=-86.5) and outputs at Position(x=47.5, y=-86.5), containing coal.\n- BeltGroup with inputs at Position(x=54.5, y=-86.5) and outputs at Position(x=53.5, y=-83.5), currently empty.\n- BeltGroup with inputs at Position(x=42.5, y=-84.5) and outputs at Position(x=45.5, y=-84.5), currently empty.\n- BeltGroup with inputs at Position(x=44.5, y=-82.5) and outputs at Position(x=42.5, y=-83.5), currently empty.\n- BeltGroup with inputs at Position(x=44.5, y=-83.5) and outputs at Position(x=44.5, y=-80.5), currently empty.\n- BeltGroup with inputs at Position(x=47.5, y=-82.5) and outputs at Position(x=49.5, y=-85.5), currently empty.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position(x=56.5, y=-83.5), currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Ensure there is a suitable and unoccupied position for placing a chest before attempting to place it. This error was encountered multiple times when trying to place a wooden chest at the end of the transport belt.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for space\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not full and can accept more items. The burner inserter at Position(x=40.5, y=-82.5) is waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Errors with mining drill outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage. The mining drill at Position(x=40.0, y=-84.0) was frequently unblocked but should be connected to a suitable sink entity."}
