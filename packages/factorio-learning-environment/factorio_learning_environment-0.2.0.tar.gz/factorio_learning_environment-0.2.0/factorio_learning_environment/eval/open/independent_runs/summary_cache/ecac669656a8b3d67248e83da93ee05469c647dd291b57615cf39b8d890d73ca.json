{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position(41.5, -80.5)) with an empty inventory.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position(-15.0, -50.0)) with an inventory containing 9 iron-ore and 82 iron-plate. It has been used multiple times for smelting iron-ore into iron-plate.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position(41.0, -82.0)) with an inventory containing 4 coal. It is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting fuel into the Furnace without ingredients**: Ensure that the Furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt before inserting fuel. The Furnace reported \"no ingredients to smelt\" when it had only coal and no iron-ore.\n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**: The Burner Mining Drill reported that the chest at the drop position is full. To continue mining, empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to allow for resource collection.\n- **Errors when extracting from the Wooden Chest with no coal left**: The Wooden Chest became empty after multiple extractions. Monitor the inventory of the Wooden Chest to avoid attempting to extract when it is empty.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: None specified in the logs.\n- **Variables Assigned**:\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: object\n  - `stone-furnace`: object\n  - `wooden-chest`: object\n\nNo functions were invoked in the latest steps, and all variables were successfully assigned without errors."}
