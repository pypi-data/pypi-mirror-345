{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) with copper-plate output\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) for crafting automation-science-pack\n- Inserter (not explicitly listed in the entities but implied for operation)\n- Beltgroup (not explicitly listed in the entities but implied for operation)\n\n### Electricity generator at position (-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler (position -13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5)\n- Small electric poles (positions -16.5, 19.5; -16.5, 20.5; -16.5, 21.5; -19.5, 22.5)\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of:\n- Pipe group (fluid system 41186) at position (-18.5, 16.5)\n- Pipe group (fluid system 41189) at position (-12.5, 21.5)\n- Pipe group (fluid system 41190) at position (-8.5, 21.5)\n- Pipe group (fluid system 41192) at position (-10.5, 22.5)\n- Pipe group (fluid system 41193) at position (-7.5, 23.5)\n\n### Lab at position (-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position -17.5, 23.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract items from the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace contains the item you are trying to extract. In this case, verify that the stone furnace at (5.0, -73.0) has copper plates available before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
