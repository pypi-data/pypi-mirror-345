{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe Groups connecting these entities:\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-44.5, -122.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -121.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -119.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-42.5, -119.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-44.5, -117.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to transfer items from the chest to another location\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Lab with no research in progress\n- Multiple PipeGroups and ElectricityGroup for fluid and power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between entities. Check the positions and ensure there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Boiler Not Operational\n- Verify that the boiler is properly connected to both a water source and a steam engine. Ensure that the input and output connections are correctly established.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the power network connections to ensure that inserters and other electrical entities are connected to a power source. Verify that all poles are connected and the power network is complete.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel. Ensure that there is a steady supply of coal or other fuel sources.\n\n### Furnaces with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to process. Check the input inventories and supply lines to prevent production halts."}
