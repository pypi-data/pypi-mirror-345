{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), (x=-12.5, y=-50.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5)\n  - Iron chests at positions (x=-6.5, y=-50.5), (x=-5.5, y=-50.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (x=4.0, y=-60.0)\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) for ore collection\n  - Additional wooden chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full inventory warnings.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Verify that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to continue smelting processes. Regularly check and refill ore supplies.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int, current count 80\n- `iron_plate`: int, current count 2634\n- `iron_gear_wheel`: int, current count 4\n- `wood`: int, current count 10"}
