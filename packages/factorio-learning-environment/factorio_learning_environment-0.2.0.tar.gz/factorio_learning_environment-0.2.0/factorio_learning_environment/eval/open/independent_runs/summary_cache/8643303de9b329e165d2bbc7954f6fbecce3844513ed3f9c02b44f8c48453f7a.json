{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), responsible for transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0), currently not receiving iron ore for smelting.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Frequent repositioning indicates potential misalignment.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the setup of inserters to ensure they are effectively transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check the inserter's pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Entities\n- Regularly monitor fuel levels in mining drills and inserters to prevent interruptions in operation. Maintain a sufficient coal supply in inventory for refueling purposes.\n\n### Chest Overcapacity\n- Avoid overfilling chests by regularly extracting resources to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full chests."}
