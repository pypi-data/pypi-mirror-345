Check for obstructions in the vicinity.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- The lab and assembling machine are currently without power. Verify the connections to the power source and ensure that electric poles are properly placed to connect these entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- When attempting to connect entities, ensure that the target positions are valid and not obstructed. Review the connection points and adjust the positions of the electric poles if necessary.\n\n### General tips for placing entities\n- Always check the surrounding area for existing entities that may block placement before attempting to place new structures or poles."}
