This includes checking both the source and destination inventories to prevent overflow errors.\n  - Regularly monitor and manage inventory levels to avoid full inventory errors, especially when dealing with high-volume items like coal and iron ore.\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- **Failed Coal Insertion into Furnace:**\n  - Before attempting to insert fuel into a furnace, check the current inventory level of the furnace to ensure it is not full. Consider setting up an automated system to monitor and refill furnaces only when necessary.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **None defined or invoked.**\n\n### Important Variables\n- **iron_ore_chest_inventory:** Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron ore in the chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- **coal_chest_inventory:** Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal in the chest at position (54.5, -78.5).\n- **stone_furnace_inventory:** Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron plates in the furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0).\n- **central_storage_inventory_1:** Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of wood, coal, and iron ore in the chest at position (0.5, 0.5).\n- **central_storage_inventory_2:** Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal, iron ore, and iron plates in the chest at position (3.5, 0.5)."}
