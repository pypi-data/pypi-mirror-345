Clear any obstructions before attempting to reconnect.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Small Electric Poles\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect electric poles.\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Check your inventory for the necessary materials before attempting to craft items like Small Electric Poles.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Type for Insert Item\n- Ensure that the second argument in the `insert_item` function is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Adjust your code accordingly to pass the correct argument type."}
