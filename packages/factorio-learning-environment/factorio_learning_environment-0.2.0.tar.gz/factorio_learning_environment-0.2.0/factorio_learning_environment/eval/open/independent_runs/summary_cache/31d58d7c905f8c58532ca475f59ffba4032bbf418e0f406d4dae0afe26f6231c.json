For example, check if the chest or inserter contains coal before attempting to extract it.\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from is the correct entity. For example, you cannot extract coal from a chest if it does not contain coal.\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from is a valid entity. For example, you cannot extract coal from a tile.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- Prototype.Coal: type = Prototype\n```"}
