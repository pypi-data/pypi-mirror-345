{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n\nThis structure is responsible for extracting iron ore and converting it into iron plates. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore and feeds it into the stone furnace, which then smelts the ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, attempting to place a burner mining drill without having one in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities at Occupied Locations\n- Verify that the target location is unoccupied before placing an entity. This applies to wooden chests, transport belts, and burner inserters. Attempting to place these entities in occupied tiles will result in placement errors.\n\n### Furnace Not Producing Iron Plates\n- Double-check the setup of your furnace to ensure it is properly configured and fueled. If the furnace is not producing iron plates, verify that it has sufficient fuel and that the input and output configurations are correct.\n\n### Errors When Placing Transport Belts\n- Ensure that transport belts are placed on clear paths and do not overlap with other entities. Misplacement can disrupt the intended flow of materials.\n\nBy addressing these common errors, you can streamline your building process and improve the efficiency of your production facilities."}
