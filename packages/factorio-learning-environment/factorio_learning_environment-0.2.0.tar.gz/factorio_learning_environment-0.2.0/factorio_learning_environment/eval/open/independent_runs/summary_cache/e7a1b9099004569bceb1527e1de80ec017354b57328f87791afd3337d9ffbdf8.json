Clear any pipes or objects that may block the connection.\n\n### Errors when using electricity\n- Verify that all electric entities are properly connected to the electric network. Check the positions of small electric poles and ensure they are within range of the entities they are meant to power.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the intended placement area.\n\n### Errors related to fluid connections\n- Confirm that the offshore pump has a valid fluid connection and that there are no blockages preventing fluid flow. Check the surrounding pipe connections for any issues."}
