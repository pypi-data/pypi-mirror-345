Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction\n- Errors when finding nearest entity of a specific type\n  - Ensure there is at least one entity of the specific type on the surface before attempting to find the nearest one\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- `connect_entities(entity1, entity2, prototype)`: Connects two entities with a transport belt. \n  - Failure modes: Cannot connect to source inserter drop_position as it is already occupied by other entities.\n  - Success modes: Entities are connected with a transport belt.\n- `place_entity_next_to(prototype, position, direction, spacing)`: Places an entity next to another entity.\n  - Failure modes: Could not place entity next to the reference position as the new position is occupied by another entity.\n  - Success modes: Entity is placed next to the reference position.\n- `nearest(prototype)`: Finds the nearest entity of a specific type.\n  - Failure modes: Could not find nearest entity of the specific type on the surface.\n  - Success modes: Nearest entity of the specific type is found.\n\nImportant variables:\n- `iron_plate_chest`: a wooden chest containing iron plates\n- `copper_cable_chest`: a wooden chest containing copper plates\n- `iron_plate_inserter`: a burner inserter that picks up iron plates from the chest\n- `input_inserters`: a list of inserters that put items into the assembling machine"}
