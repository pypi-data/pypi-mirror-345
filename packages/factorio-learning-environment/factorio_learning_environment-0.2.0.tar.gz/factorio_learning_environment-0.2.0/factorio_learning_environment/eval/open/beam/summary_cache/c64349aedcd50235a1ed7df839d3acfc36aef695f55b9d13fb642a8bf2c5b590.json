{"content": "I notice from the output that the mining drill is showing a warning: \"waiting for space in destination as the output is full\". We need to place a chest to collect the output. Let's fix this:\n\n```python\n# First let's place a wooden chest next to the drill's output\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Found drill at {drill.position} with drop position {drill.drop_position}\")\n\n# Place chest near the drill's output\nchest = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at {chest.position}\")\n\n# Now place inserter between drill output and chest\ninserter = place_entity_relative_to(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n    relative_position=Position(x=1, y=0),\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT  # Point towards chest\n)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to inserter\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\nprint(\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Verify setup\nprint(f\"Inserter status: {inserter.status}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter pickup position: {inserter.pickup_position}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter drop position: {inserter.drop_position}\")\n```\n\nThis should create a working chain:\n1. Drill mines ore\n2. Inserter picks up from drill's output\n3. Inserter drops into chest\n4. We can manually move ore from chest to furnace as needed\n\nThe key changes are:\n1. Adding a chest as the destination\n2. Positioning the inserter correctly between drill and chest\n3. Making sure the inserter is oriented to pick up from drill and drop into chest", "summary_range": "[1-2890]"}
