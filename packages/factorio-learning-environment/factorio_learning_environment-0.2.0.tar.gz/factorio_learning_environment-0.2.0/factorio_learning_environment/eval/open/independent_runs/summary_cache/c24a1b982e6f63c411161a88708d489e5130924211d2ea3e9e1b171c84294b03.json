{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (61.0, -52.0) and (63.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -52.0) and Furnace at position (63.0, -52.0)\n- Both furnaces are connected to a supply of copper ore, with the furnace at (61.0, -52.0) having a fuel source of coal and currently producing copper plates.\n\n### Copper ore mine at position (-28.5, -61.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-28.5, -61.5) which is extracting copper ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace is not full before inserting items. The current logs indicate that the furnaces at positions (61.0, -52.0) and (63.0, -52.0) are full, which prevents further insertion.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
