Always check the function\u2019s signature before calling.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Issues:\n  \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), verify the lab is available in inventory to prevent placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Handling Null Returns:\n  \u2013 When filtering for lab entities, ensure the result is not None (implement a fallback to an empty list) to avoid iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages:\n  \u2013 Multiple lab crafting attempts failed due to missing sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables). Secure sufficient resources and pre-craft all prerequisite components before attempting lab production.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Chain Dependencies:\n  \u2013 Verify the entire resource and production chain is complete prior to advanced crafting steps to avoid cascading ingredient shortages."}
