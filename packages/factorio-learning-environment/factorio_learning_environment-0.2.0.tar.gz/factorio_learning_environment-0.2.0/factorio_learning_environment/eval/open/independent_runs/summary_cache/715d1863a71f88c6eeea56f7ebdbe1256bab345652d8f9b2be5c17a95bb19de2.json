{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (8.5, -0.5).\n- Stone furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (17.5, -0.5).\n- Stone furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (19.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (19.5, -0.5).\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (20.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (20.5, -0.5).\n- Multiple wooden chests storing iron ore and iron plates at various positions.\n\n### Electricity Generation Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) connected to a boiler.\n- Steam engine at position (35.5, 27.5) connected to a small electric pole at position (33.5, 24.5) and another at position (35.5, 24.5).\n- Pipe and pipe-to-ground connections facilitating water flow from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at an unspecified position with automation science packs but currently without power.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple pipe groups at various positions, facilitating fluid transport across the map:\n- PipeGroup at position (17.5, 3.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 18.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (18.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (22.5, 20.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (14.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (16.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (7.5, 24.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of an electricity group with multiple poles at various positions, providing potential power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Entity Pickup\n- Ensure the correct usage of the `pickup_entity` function. If the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None. Avoid specifying a position when using this function.\n\n### Connection Errors with Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- When connecting an offshore pump to a boiler, ensure that the pipes and underground pipes are correctly placed and do not overlap with water or other obstructions. Verify the connection path is clear and feasible.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, verify that the target tile is not occupied by another entity to avoid placement errors."}
