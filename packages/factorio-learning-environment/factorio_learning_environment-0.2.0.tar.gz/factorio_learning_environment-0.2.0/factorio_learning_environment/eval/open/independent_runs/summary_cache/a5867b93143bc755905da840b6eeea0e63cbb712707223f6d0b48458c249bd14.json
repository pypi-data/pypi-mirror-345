{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5), transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -47.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -47.5), storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Misalignment Errors with Inserters\n- Always verify the alignment between inserter pickup and drop positions with respect to the connected entities. Misalignment can cause inefficiencies or stoppages in production.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity is actively producing items or is not blocked to prevent inserters from idling due to lack of source items.\n\n### Warnings about Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from production entities like mining drills to avoid blockage warnings and production halts."}
