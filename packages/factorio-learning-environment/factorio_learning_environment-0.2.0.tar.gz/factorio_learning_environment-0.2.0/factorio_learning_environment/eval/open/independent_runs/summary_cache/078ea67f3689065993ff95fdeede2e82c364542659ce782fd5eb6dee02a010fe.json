{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Neighbors: \n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (10,000 units available)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Contains: Iron ore (494 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Neighbors:\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Reposition and align the inserter if necessary to facilitate the transfer of iron ore.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like inserters and mining drills. Harvest coal when necessary to maintain a sufficient supply.\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Check that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to operate. Ensure that the inserter is correctly configured to deliver iron ore to the furnace.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary materials for operations, such as coal for refueling and iron ore for smelting."}
