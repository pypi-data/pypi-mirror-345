If inserters are waiting for source items, check the supply chain to ensure raw materials are being delivered to the inserter's pickup position.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the items you are attempting to insert. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in your inventory will result in an error. Always verify your inventory before attempting such actions.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities like burner mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and replenish fuel to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests connected to production facilities. If a chest is full, it will halt the production process. Ensure that items are being removed from chests to maintain production flow."}
