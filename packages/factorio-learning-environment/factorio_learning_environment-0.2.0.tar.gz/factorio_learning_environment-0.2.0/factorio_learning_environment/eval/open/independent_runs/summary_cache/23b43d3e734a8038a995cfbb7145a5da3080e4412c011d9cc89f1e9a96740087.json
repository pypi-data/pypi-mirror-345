{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-34.5, 35.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-28.5, 36.5)\n- Boiler at position (-34.5, 35.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-36.5, 19.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, producing copper plates\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (not specified), currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, currently empty or not successfully connected.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using Offshore Pump\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is correctly placed at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. Verify the position and existence of the offshore pump to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the connection points between entities like boilers and steam engines are not blocked. Reposition entities if necessary to unblock connection points.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that the lab and other entities requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. Verify that the electricity generator is operational and supplying power.\n\n### Errors when Placing Steam Engines\n- Verify that the selected location for placing steam engines is suitable and does not overlap with water or other obstacles. Choose a different location if placement fails.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure that the required items, such as pipes, are available in the inventory before attempting to connect entities."}
