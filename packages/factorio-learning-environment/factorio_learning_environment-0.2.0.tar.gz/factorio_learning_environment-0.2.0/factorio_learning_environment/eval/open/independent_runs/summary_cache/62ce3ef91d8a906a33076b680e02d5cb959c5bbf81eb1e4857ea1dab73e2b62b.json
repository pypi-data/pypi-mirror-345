{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (9998 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Contains: Iron Ore (707 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n### Inserter Setup\n- **Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Function: Transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n  - Fuel: Coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a tile before attempting placement. Check for collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water).\n- Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position if placement fails due to collisions.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure you have the required resources in your inventory. For example, make sure you have coal available before trying to refuel a mining drill.\n\n### Errors in inserter setup\n- Verify the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they correctly transfer materials between entities. If a furnace is not receiving ore, check the inserter setup for misalignment or incorrect positioning."}
