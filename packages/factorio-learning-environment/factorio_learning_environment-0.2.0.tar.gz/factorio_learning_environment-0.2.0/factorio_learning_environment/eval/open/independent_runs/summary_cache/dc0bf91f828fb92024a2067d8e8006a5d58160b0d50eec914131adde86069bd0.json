This structure is critical for providing sufficient iron plates needed in subsequent crafting steps.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of a furnace entity used for converting copper ore into copper plates. The copper plates feed into the production of copper cables, which are essential for advancing the lab crafting chain.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Misuse\n  - Ensure that the get_entities function is invoked with parameters that match its defined signature. Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as 'radius') or supplying extra positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Validation\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab, verify that a Lab item is available in the inventory to prevent placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Guarding Against Invalid Iteration\n  - When filtering or iterating over retrieved entities, confirm that the returned collection is not None to avoid iteration on a NoneType.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Recipe Chain Completeness\n  - Confirm that all intermediary components for Lab crafting (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are producible and available. Ensure that the smelting and crafting setups yield the necessary sub-ingredients before retrying Lab production."}
