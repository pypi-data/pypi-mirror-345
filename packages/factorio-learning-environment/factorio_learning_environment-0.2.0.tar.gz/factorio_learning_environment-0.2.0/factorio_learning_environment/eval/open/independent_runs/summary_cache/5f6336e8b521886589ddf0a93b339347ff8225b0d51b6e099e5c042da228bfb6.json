{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing mined coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for processing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) to transfer coal from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) for processing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into a structure, verify that the required resources are available in your inventory. This will prevent errors related to missing resources during the insertion process."}
