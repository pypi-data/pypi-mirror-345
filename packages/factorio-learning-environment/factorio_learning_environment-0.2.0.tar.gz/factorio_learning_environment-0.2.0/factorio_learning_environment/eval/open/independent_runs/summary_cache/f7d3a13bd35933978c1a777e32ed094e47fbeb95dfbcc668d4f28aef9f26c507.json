{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at position(x=44.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position(x=44.5, y=-83.5) containing 650 coal and 250 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0) with warnings of \"out of fuel\" and \"chest at drop position is full.\"\n- Wooden chest at position(x=40.5, y=-83.5) containing 159 coal.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Stone Furnace Operation at position(x=61.0, y=-54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position(x=61.0, y=-54.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner inserter at position(x=62.5, y=-53.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden chest at position(x=61.5, y=-52.5) containing stone bricks, wood, coal, and stone.\n\n### Belt Networks\nConsists of multiple belt groups connecting various positions:\n- BeltGroup connecting position(x=45.5, y=-82.5) to position(x=48.5, y=-79.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting position(x=43.5, y=-80.5) to position(x=63.5, y=-50.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting position(x=42.5, y=-81.5) to position(x=65.5, y=-46.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting position(x=44.5, y=-81.5) to position(x=65.5, y=-54.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting position(x=49.5, y=-80.5) to position(x=60.5, y=-69.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting position(x=49.5, y=-78.5) to position(x=58.5, y=-69.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting position(x=50.5, y=-79.5) to position(x=59.5, y=-70.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting position(x=59.5, y=-68.5) to position(x=67.5, y=-54.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that your inventory has sufficient space before attempting to harvest or extract items. Consider building additional storage or dropping excess items to free up space.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Before attempting to extract items, ensure that the target entity is not blocked and that your inventory has space to accommodate the extracted items.\n\n### Supply Chain Errors\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to supply furnaces or other entities. Regularly check and restock your inventory to avoid supply chain disruptions.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly refuel entities that require fuel, such as burner mining drills and inserters, to prevent interruptions in operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like transport belts, burner inserters, stone furnaces, coal, iron plates, and iron gear wheels."}
