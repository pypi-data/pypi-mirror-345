Check for any existing entities or terrain that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure the target position for small electric poles is clear of any obstacles. If an existing object is in the way, find an alternative location.\n\n### Errors when searching for nearest entities\n- If unable to find the nearest small electric pole or steam engine, ensure that these entities are present on the map. If they are not, consider placing them in appropriate locations.\n\n### Errors when connecting power sources\n- Ensure that there is a valid power source nearby when attempting to connect entities. If the connection fails, verify the position of the power source and the entity needing power."}
