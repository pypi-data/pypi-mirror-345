{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that is waiting for space in destination\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) that contains coal\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that is waiting for source items\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that contains iron ore\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently working and has iron plates in its inventory\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to fuel depletion**: \n  - Ensure that burner mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and replenish fuel supplies to avoid downtime.\n  \n- **Errors when inserting items into entities**:\n  - Ensure that the destination entities (like inserters and furnaces) have space available before attempting to insert items into them.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**:\n  - Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int"}
