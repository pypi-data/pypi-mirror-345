Repeated use of outdated IDs (e.g., 28660, 28703, 28746, 28789, 28832, 28875, 28918, 28961) led to unsuccessful connection attempts. Adjust to the currently active identifier ([29004] for the working PipeGroup) to ensure proper connections.\n\n\u2022 Inflexible Pipeline Stabilization Waiting:\n  - Replace fixed waiting periods with dynamic connectivity checks. Relying on static delays (10 seconds) has consistently failed to secure pipeline readiness before retrying the connection.\n"}
