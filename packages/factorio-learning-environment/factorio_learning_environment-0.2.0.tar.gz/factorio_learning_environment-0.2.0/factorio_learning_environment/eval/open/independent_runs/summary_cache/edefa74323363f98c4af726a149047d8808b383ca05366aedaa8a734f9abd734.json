{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0) to (-9.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with a burner inserter at (-11.5, -49.5) supplying iron ore.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with a burner inserter at (-10.5, -49.5) supplying iron ore.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0) with a burner inserter at (-8.5, -49.5) supplying iron ore.\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Iron chests and wooden chests positioned to store iron plates and iron ore.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Burner inserters positioned to transfer materials between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: Positioned at (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- **Furnace**: Stone furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) processing coal.\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Iron chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), and additional chests for coal and iron plate storage.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Burner inserters positioned to transfer coal and iron plates between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Refueling or Supplying Iron Ore to Furnaces\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply furnaces. This will prevent the \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" error.\n\n### Errors when Harvesting with Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and manage your inventory space to avoid the \"Could not harvest. Inventory is full\" error. Transfer excess items to storage chests to free up space.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Blockages\n- Ensure that you are positioned correctly and have the necessary permissions or tools to clear blockages at inserter drop positions to avoid extraction failures.\n\n### Errors with Full Drop Chests\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage. This will prevent warnings like \"chest at drop position is full.\"\n\n### Errors when Refueling with Insufficient Fuel\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Refuel entities before they run out to avoid interruptions."}
