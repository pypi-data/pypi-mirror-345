{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully established on the map. Multiple recovery updates focused on supplying a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for Automation Science Packs research; however, every attempt to place or craft a Lab failed. Although existing furnace entities were used (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron plate smelting and one at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production), no structure built by the agent remains on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Issues for get_entities  \n\u2003\u2013 Avoid passing unsupported arguments. Two different calls used either an unexpected keyword argument ('radius') or extra positional arguments, causing type errors. Verify the function\u2019s signature and pass only the allowed arguments.\n\n\u2022 Unchecked None Returns  \n\u2003\u2013 When operations return None (as seen when retrieving Lab entities), attempting to iterate over the result causes errors. Always check for None before iterating.\n\n\u2022 Resource and Sub-Ingredient Shortages in Lab Crafting  \n\u2003\u2013 Lab crafting consistently failed due to missing sub-ingredients (for example, insufficient iron plates to produce iron-gear-wheels, or inadequate copper-plates leading to a shortfall in copper-cables and electronic circuits). Ensure that all prerequisite materials and crafting processes are in place before attempting Lab production.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Inventory Check  \n\u2003\u2013 Errors indicating \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d led to failed placement attempts at (0.5, 2.5). Confirm that the Lab item is available in inventory prior to placement."}
