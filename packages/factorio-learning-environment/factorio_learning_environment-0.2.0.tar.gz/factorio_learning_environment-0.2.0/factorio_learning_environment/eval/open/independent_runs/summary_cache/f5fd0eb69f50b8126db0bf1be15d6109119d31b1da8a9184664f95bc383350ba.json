{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (40.5, y=-83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the chest at position (40.5, y=-83.5) to another chest at position (42.5, y=-83.5)\n- Wooden chests at positions (40.5, y=-83.5), (42.5, y=-83.5), (43.5, y=-83.5), and (44.5, y=-83.5) used for coal storage and transfer\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, y=-54.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, y=-53.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Wooden chests at positions (61.5, y=-52.5), (62.5, y=-53.5), and (62.5, y=-52.5) used for storing various resources including stone bricks, wood, coal, and stone\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or altering the reference position to avoid overlap.\n\n### Insufficient resources for operations\n- Regularly check the inventory for required resources such as iron ore and ensure they are adequately stocked to prevent operation halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity_next_to`: Attempts to place an entity next to a specified position with given spacing and direction. Failure occurs if the target position is occupied by another entity.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inserter`: Represents the placement of a burner-inserter in various positions, with attempts to adjust spacing and direction.\n- `inventory`: Tracks the current inventory of resources such as coal and iron plates."}
