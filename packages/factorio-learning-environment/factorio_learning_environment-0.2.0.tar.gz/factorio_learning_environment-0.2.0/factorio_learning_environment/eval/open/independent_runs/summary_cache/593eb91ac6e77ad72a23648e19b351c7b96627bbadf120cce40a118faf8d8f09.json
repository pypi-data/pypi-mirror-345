{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), currently working but unable to continue due to a full chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions (5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, -60.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) storing a large quantity of iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with warnings of full output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt and full output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when extracting from a full chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is emptied regularly to allow the mining drill to continue operation. Consider using inserters to automate the transfer of items from the chest to another storage or processing unit.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract items from a chest\n- Verify that the chest is not full before attempting to extract items. If the chest is full, items cannot be extracted until space is made available.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the given steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `final_inventory: dict` - Represents the final state of the agent's inventory, containing items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
