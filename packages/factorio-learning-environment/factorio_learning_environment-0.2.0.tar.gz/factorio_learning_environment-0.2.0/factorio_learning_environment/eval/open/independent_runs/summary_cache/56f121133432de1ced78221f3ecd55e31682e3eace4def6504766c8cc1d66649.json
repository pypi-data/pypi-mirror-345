Move closer to the desired position.\n\n### Errors when lacking inventory items\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to place an entity. Ensure you have the required items available to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target area."}
