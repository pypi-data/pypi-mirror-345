{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and the Boiler to the Steam Engine, facilitating water and steam flow.\n\n### Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab connected to the power supply, currently working on research.\n- Automation science packs inserted into the lab.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), and (x=3.5, y=20.5)\n- Connected to the Steam Engine, providing power to the lab and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Research Setup\n- Ensure that the research prerequisites are met before attempting to start research. Check the technology tree for required technologies.\n\n### Errors in Lab Operations\n- Verify that the lab has the necessary science packs and is properly connected to the power supply. Ensure that the lab status is not \"NO_RESEARCH_IN_PROGRESS\" before proceeding.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Maintain a sufficient coal inventory to keep the boiler fueled. Regularly check the fuel levels and replenish as necessary to avoid interruptions in power generation.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connections\n- Confirm that all entities, such as the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, are correctly connected with pipes to ensure fluid flow. Regularly check connections to prevent any disconnections that may halt operations."}
