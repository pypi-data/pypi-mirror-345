{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Repeated repositioning of the inserter at (-13.5, -48.5) indicates alignment issues.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly positioned and operational to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. The furnace at (-12.0, -48.0) is not receiving iron ore, possibly due to misalignment or lack of fuel.\n\n### Chest Overcapacity\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to prevent it from becoming full, which halts mining operations.\n\n### Refueling Requirements\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as the burner mining drill, inserter, and furnace, are consistently refueled to maintain operation."}
