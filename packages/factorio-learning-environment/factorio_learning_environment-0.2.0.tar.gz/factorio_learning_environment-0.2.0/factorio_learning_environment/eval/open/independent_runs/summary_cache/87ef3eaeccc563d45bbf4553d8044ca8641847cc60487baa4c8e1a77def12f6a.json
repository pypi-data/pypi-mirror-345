{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station (x=24.0, y=-15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) collecting coal output\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station (x=-14.0, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) collecting iron ore output\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Station (x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) collecting copper ore output\n- Additional storage chest at (22.5, 21.5) containing copper ore\n\n### Copper Smelting Station\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items between furnace and output chest\n\n### Unused Smelting Setup\nTwo unused stone furnaces at:\n- Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Position (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters in occupied spaces\n- Before placing an inserter, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- When placing inserters near furnaces, ensure proper spacing and alignment with input/output positions\n- The positions (23.5, 20.5) and (23.0, 20.5) were blocked by existing entities\n\n### Furnace efficiency issues\n- Multiple furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- One furnace has a full fuel source inventory - consider better fuel management\n- Ensure proper input/output connections for furnaces to maintain continuous operation"}
