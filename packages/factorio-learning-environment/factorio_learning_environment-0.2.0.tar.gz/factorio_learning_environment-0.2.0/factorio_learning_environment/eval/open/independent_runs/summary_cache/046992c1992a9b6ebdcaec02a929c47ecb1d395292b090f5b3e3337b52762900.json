Check that the connected chests have the required items for the inserters to operate.\n\n### Errors with Fueling and Clearing Chests\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and clear drop chests to prevent operation halts. Ensure that there is a continuous supply of fuel and that chests are emptied to allow for ongoing operations.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of necessary items like iron ore and coal to avoid interruptions in production. Monitor inventory levels and restock as needed to prevent shortages.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement and Status\n- Verify that entities like furnaces and drills have the necessary inputs and are not obstructed by full chests or lack of fuel. Regularly check the status of entities to ensure they are operating efficiently."}
