{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x=52.5, y=51.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (x=52.5, y=50.0)\n- Boiler at position (x=52.5, y=51.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=8.5, y=1.5)\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (x=10.0, y=1.0)\n- Chest (wooden-chest) at position (x=3.5, y=1.5)\n- Chest (wooden-chest) at position (x=3.5, y=3.5)\n- Chest (wooden-chest) at position (x=3.5, y=5.5)\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connected to the offshore pump\n\n### Electricity distribution network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions [(x=22.5,y=10.5), (x=14.5,y=14.5), (x=26.5,y=14.5), (x=52.5,y=54.5), (x=55.5,y=54.5), (x=55.5,y=55.5)]\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target location is free of obstacles or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water) before attempting to place an electric pole.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Confirm that the steam engine is within range and can accept coal before attempting to insert it. If the steam engine is not nearby or is not powered, the insertion will fail.\n\n### Errors with electricity groups\n- Check for any entities blocking the connection points of electricity groups. Remove any blocking entities before attempting to connect new electric poles."}
