{"content": "I now understand the core issue. The error \"Could not find a nearby entity that can accept coal\" suggests that either:\n\n1. The output inserter isn't being placed correctly, or\n2. We're too far away when trying to insert coal\n\nLet's modify our approach to be more precise with placement and ensure we're close enough when inserting fuel:\n\n```python\n# First check inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Craft ALL needed items first\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter, quantity=2)\nprint(\"Crafted stone furnace and burner inserters\")\n\n# Get coal first\ncoal_pos = nearest(Resource.Coal)\nif coal_pos:\n    move_to(coal_pos)\n    harvest_resource(coal_pos, quantity=20)\n    print(\"Harvested coal for fuel\")\n\n# Place furnace first\nmove_to(Position(x=-11.5, y=21.5))\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(x=-11.5, y=21.5)\n)\n\nif furnace:\n    print(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    # Add fuel to furnace immediately while we're close\n    move_to(furnace.position)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n    \n    # Place and fuel input inserter\n    move_to(Position(x=-13.5, y=21.5))\n    input_inserter = place_entity(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n        position=Position(x=-13.5, y=21.5)\n    )\n    \n    if input_inserter:\n        print(f\"Added input inserter at {input_inserter.position}\")\n        rotate_entity(input_inserter, Direction.RIGHT)\n        # Add fuel while we're next to it\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, input_inserter, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added fuel to input inserter\")\n        \n        # Place and fuel output inserter\n        move_to(Position(x=-9.5, y=21.5))\n        output_inserter = place_entity(\n            Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n            position=Position(x=-9.5, y=21.5)\n        )\n        \n        if output_inserter:\n            print(f\"Added output inserter at {output_inserter.position}\")\n            rotate_entity(output_inserter, Direction.RIGHT)\n            # Add fuel while we're next to it\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, output_inserter, quantity=5)\n            print(\"Added fuel to output inserter\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Current entities: {entities}\")\n```\n\nKey changes:\n1. Get coal before placing entities\n2. Add fuel immediately after placing each entity while we're still next to it\n3. Move explicitly to each entity's position before trying to insert fuel\n4. Added more detailed status messages to track progress\n\nThis should resolve the \"entity not found\" error when trying to insert coal, as we'll be right next to each entity when we try to fuel it.", "summary_range": "[1-1184]"}
