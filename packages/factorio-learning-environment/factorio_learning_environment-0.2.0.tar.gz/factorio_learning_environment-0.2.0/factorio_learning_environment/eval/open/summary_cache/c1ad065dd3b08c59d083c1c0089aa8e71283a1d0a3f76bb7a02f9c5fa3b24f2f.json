{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=1.5) extracting water\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=4.5) with coal fuel but no input liquid\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=8.5) connected to power network\n- Pipe network connecting these components:\n  - Pipes at positions (-8.5, 1.5), (-7.5, 1.5), (-6.5, 1.5), (-6.5, 2.5)\n  - Steam pipe group connecting boiler to steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at position (30.0, 86.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=30.0, y=86.0) with coal fuel\n- Wooden chest (position x=30.5, y=87.5) collecting iron ore\n- Burner inserter (position x=31.5, y=87.5) out of fuel\n- Stone furnace (position x=33.0, y=88.0) with coal fuel but no ingredients\n\n### Second Iron Ore Mining Operation at position (36.0, 90.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=36.0, y=90.0) with coal fuel\n- Wooden chest (position x=36.5, y=91.5) collecting iron ore\n\n### Smelting Area\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=43.0, y=89.0) with coal fuel but no ingredients\n- Second stone furnace (position x=51.0, y=92.0) out of fuel and no ingredients\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Line at position (56.5, 94.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position x=56.5, y=94.5) set to produce iron gear wheels\n- Input inserter (position x=54.5, y=94.5) to feed materials\n- Output inserter (position x=58.5, y=94.5) to extract products\n- Input wooden chest (position x=52.5, y=94.5) for iron plates\n- Output wooden chest (position x=59.5, y=94.5) for collecting iron gear wheels\n- Power poles connecting the assembly area\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- When connecting entities with pipes, ensure there is a valid path between them\n- For the offshore pump to boiler connection, place pipes in a continuous path that follows valid connection points\n- When connecting boiler to steam engine, ensure pipes follow a valid path between the steam output point of the boiler and the input of the steam engine\n- Avoid placing pipes where terrain is unplaceable (like water) or where other entities already exist\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or unsuitable locations\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is suitable and not occupied by other entities\n- Use the agent's position and entity information to find clear spaces for placement\n- When placing mining drills, ensure they are positioned directly over resource patches\n\n### Errors with resource management\n- Ensure you have the necessary raw resources before attempting to craft items\n- Remember that some items like stone furnaces require stone, which must be mined first\n- Iron plates cannot be crafted directly and require smelting iron ore in a furnace\n\n### Errors with variable references\n- Be careful with variable names to avoid undefined references\n- When referencing entities, ensure the variable has been properly defined earlier in the code\n- Pay attention to error messages that suggest similar variable names that are defined\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner devices (mining drills, inserters, boilers)\n- Refuel entities before they run out completely\n- Ensure you have sufficient coal in inventory before attempting to refuel entities\n\n### Errors with entity placement relative to resources\n- When placing mining drills, ensure they are positioned correctly over resource patches\n- Check that the drop position of mining drills is accessible by inserters or chests\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to furnaces. Use inserters as intermediaries between belts and furnaces\n- Ensure proper input/output flow when designing belt systems"}
