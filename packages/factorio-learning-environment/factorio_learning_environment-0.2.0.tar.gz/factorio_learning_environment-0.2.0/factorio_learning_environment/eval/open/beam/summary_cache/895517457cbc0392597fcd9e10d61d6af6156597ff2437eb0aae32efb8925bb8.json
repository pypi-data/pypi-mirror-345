{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Produces iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Collection Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Drops mined resources to position (-15.5, -51.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5)\n  - Collects mined iron ore from the burner mining drill\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) to the stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -51.5)\n  - Collects iron ore from the inserter\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required raw materials are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, stone must be gathered before crafting a stone furnace, and wood must be gathered before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Entities\n- Verify that the target entity contains the item you wish to extract before attempting extraction. For instance, ensure that the furnace contains iron plates before trying to extract them.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Confirm that the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, ensure a wooden chest is crafted and available before placing it.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined correctly. For instance, ensure that 'extracted_iron_plates' is defined before using it in conditional statements.\n\n### Errors Due to Incorrect Crafting Processes\n- Remember that certain items, like iron plates, require specific crafting processes, such as smelting in a furnace, rather than direct crafting.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Iron Ore\n- Ensure that the wooden chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) contains iron ore before attempting extraction. Regularly check the mining drill's output and ensure it is correctly aligned with the collection chest.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Too Far Away\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 units. For instance, when placing a wooden chest, ensure the player is within this distance limit.\n\n### Errors in Aligning Collection Chests\n- Ensure that the drill's drop position is correctly aligned with the wooden chest. Misalignment can cause mining output to be lost or not collected properly.\n\n### Errors in Extracting When No Resources Available\n- Check the inventory of the collection chest to ensure it contains the resources you wish to extract. If the chest is empty, verify the mining drill's operation and alignment.\n\n### Errors Due to Obstructions at Drop Position\n- Ensure there are no obstructions at the drill's drop position. If obstructions are detected, adjust the setup to ensure the drill can deposit resources correctly.\n\n### Errors in Repeated Misalignment of Collection Chests\n- When repositioning collection chests, ensure that the new position is correctly aligned with the drill's drop position to prevent repeated misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all machines requiring fuel have a sufficient supply. For instance, make sure the inserter and the burner mining drill have enough coal to operate continuously.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operations\n- Verify that the inserter has a source item available to transfer. If the inserter is waiting for source items, check the alignment and supply of the source entity.\n\n### Errors in Monitoring and Repositioning Drills\n- Avoid unnecessary repositioning of the burner mining drill unless required. Frequent repositioning can lead to inefficiencies and potential misalignment with the collection setup."}
