{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis system is designed to transfer iron ore from a mining drill to a furnace for smelting into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the ground.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace. Currently, it faces alignment issues with the chest.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position. The pickup position should match the chest's position to function properly.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position to ensure successful transfer of iron ore.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Running out of coal can halt operations.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure that the furnace is receiving iron ore. Misalignment can prevent the furnace from receiving necessary ingredients for smelting."}
