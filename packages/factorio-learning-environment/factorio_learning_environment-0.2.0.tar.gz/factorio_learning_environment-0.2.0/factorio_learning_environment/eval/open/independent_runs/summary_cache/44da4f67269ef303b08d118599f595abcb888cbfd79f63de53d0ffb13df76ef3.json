{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction Setup at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) which is currently out of fuel and has a chest at its drop position that is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) which contains 81 units of coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15, -50)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) which is currently full of coal (50 units) and has 100 iron plates in its output inventory. It has warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt and that the fuel source is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting items from the wooden chest**\n  - Ensure that the wooden chest has enough items to extract before attempting to extract. The extraction attempts for coal failed multiple times due to insufficient items in the chest.\n  \n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace**\n  - The furnace is full (both fuel and output inventories). Clear the furnace's output inventory or ensure it has space before attempting to insert items. Multiple attempts to insert coal into the furnace failed due to it being full.\n\n- **Errors when picking up entities**\n  - The inventory is full, preventing the pickup of the wooden chest. Clear some space in the inventory to allow for pickups.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined:**\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, wooden_chest, quantity)` - Failed multiple times due to insufficient items in the wooden chest.\n  - `insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity)` - Failed multiple times due to the furnace being full.\n  - `pickup_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, Position(x=41.5, y=-80.5))` - Failed due to full inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `extracted_count: int`\n  - `pickup_success: bool`\n  - `furnace: Furnace`\n  - `wooden_chest: Chest`"}
