{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Connected to a **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which transfers items from a chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5)\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Connected to a **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) which transfers items from a chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5)\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) containing iron plates\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) containing iron plates\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for intermediate storage\n\n### Inserter System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items, with pickup and drop positions at (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) respectively.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and restock the source to avoid idle inserters.\n\n### No Iron Plates Available in Input Chest\n- Verify that the production of iron plates is consistent and that the output is being transferred to the input chest. Consider adding more furnaces or optimizing the current setup to increase production.\n\n### No Iron Ore Available in Ore Chest\n- Maintain a steady supply of iron ore to the furnaces by ensuring that the mining drills are operational and adequately fueled. Regularly check the ore chest and refuel mining drills as necessary.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination chest or entity has enough space to receive items from the inserter. Regularly clear or expand storage to prevent bottlenecks."}
