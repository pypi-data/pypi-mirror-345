{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with no fuel, connected to:\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with a source inventory containing 2 iron ore, but currently out of fuel.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with 10 units of coal, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with 19 units of coal, currently working and connected to:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel in Entities\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces to keep them operational. This will prevent warnings such as \"out of fuel.\"\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Errors occur if the item is not present in the inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity, used in insertion operations.\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity, used in insertion operations.\n  - `iron_mining_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity, used in insertion operations."}
