Iron Ore Mining Station at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner mining drill extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-13.5, -50.5) for temporary storage\n- Input burner inserter at (-14.5, -51.5)\n- Output burner inserter at (-12.5, -50.5) connecting to transport belt system\n\n2. Iron Plate Production at (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\n- Two stone furnaces for smelting iron plates\n- Input inserters at (45.5, -81.5) and (47.5, -81.5)\n- Output inserters at (45.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5)\n- Storage chests:\n  - Input chests at (45.5, -77.5) and (47.5, -77.5)\n  - Output chests at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5)\n  - Additional storage at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n\n3. Coal Mining Station at (38.0, -83.0)\n- Burner mining drill extracting coal\n- Complex belt system for coal transport\n- Burner inserter at (38.5, -84.5) for material handling\n- Storage chest at (41.5, -86.5)\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -86.5) managing chest input\n\n4. Transport System\n- Extensive belt network connecting iron ore mining to furnaces (118 belts)\n- Secondary belt groups for coal transport (4 belts)\n- Additional belt group for output transport (5 belts)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Belt Placement Errors\n- Always check if an entity already exists at target position before placing new belts\n- Remove existing entities if they need to be replaced\n\n2. Inventory Management\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting placement (transport belts were missing)\n- Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow (chest at 49.5, -80.5 is full)\n\n3. Belt System Issues\n- Clear blocked transport belts to maintain material flow (blocked belt at 39.5, -83.5)\n- Verify belt group connections before operations\n\n4. System Operation\n- Monitor furnace ingredient supply (currently showing NO_INGREDIENTS status)\n- Ensure proper fuel distribution to all burner entities\n\nNAMESPACE\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the world. Fails when target position is occupied or required items missing in inventory\n- get_entities(): Retrieves entities by prototype. Fails when no matching entities exist\n\nImportant Variables:\n- belt_group: BeltGroup - Used for managing connected transport belt systems\n- furnace_status: EntityStatus - Tracks furnace operational state\n- mining_drill_status: EntityStatus - Tracks mining drill operational state"}
