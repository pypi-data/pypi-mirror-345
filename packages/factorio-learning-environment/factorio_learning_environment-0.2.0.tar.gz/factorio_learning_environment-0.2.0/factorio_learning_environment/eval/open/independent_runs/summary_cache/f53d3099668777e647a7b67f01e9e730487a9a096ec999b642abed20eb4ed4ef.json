Regularly check the inserter setup to confirm it is correctly configured and operational.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters and Drills\n- Regularly refuel inserters and mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel. Monitor fuel levels and replenish coal or other fuel types as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Chest Overflow Management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent overflow. Regularly extract items from the chest to free up space and ensure continuous mining operations. Consider expanding storage capacity or processing materials more efficiently to manage overflow.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Supply\n- Ensure that the furnace receives the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inserter and supply chain to confirm that iron ore or other materials are being delivered to the furnace for processing."}
