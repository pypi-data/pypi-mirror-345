{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining drill at position(x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of a burner-mining-drill at position (x=41, y=-82), a wooden-chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and another wooden-chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5). The burner-mining-drill is used for mining coal and the wooden-chests are used for storing the mined coal.\n\n### Coal inserter at position(x=39.5, y=-81.5)\nConsists of a burner-inserter at position (x=39.5, y=-81.5) that is connected to the coal mining drill. The inserter is used to transport coal from the mining drill to other parts of the factory.\n\n### Furnace at position(x=0, y=0)\nConsists of a stone-furnace at position (x=0, y=0) that is used for smelting coal into other products. However, the furnace is currently not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the inventory of the entity is not full before attempting to insert items.\n- Check the warnings of the entity to see if the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an empty chest\n- Ensure that the chest is not empty before attempting to extract items.\n- Check the warnings of the entity to see if the chest is full or empty.\n\n### Errors when using a furnace with no ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt before attempting to use it.\n- Check the warnings of the entity to see if the furnace fuel source is full or if there are no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent. \nImportant variables that have been assigned include:\n* `coal_chest`: a wooden-chest entity used for storing coal\n* `drill`: a burner-mining-drill entity used for mining coal\n* `inserter`: a burner-inserter entity used for transporting coal\n* `furnace`: a stone-furnace entity used for smelting coal into other products"}
