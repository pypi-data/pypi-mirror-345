{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with inventory containing 20 copper plates and 3 coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an empty inventory.\n\n### Copper Plate Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) that smelts copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Crafting Station\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) that provides iron plates for crafting iron gear wheels.\n\n### Automation Science Pack Crafting Station\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) that provides copper plates for crafting automation science packs.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients**\n  - Ensure that the required ingredients for crafting (such as iron plates and copper plates) are available in the inventory or can be produced in the furnace before attempting to craft items.\n  \n- **Errors when using undefined variables**\n  - Make sure to define all variables before using them in conditions or functions. Check for typos in variable names to avoid NameErrors.\n\n- **Repeated errors when crafting Automation Science Packs**\n  - The crafting of Automation Science Packs fails due to the unavailability of copper plates. Ensure that copper ore is continuously fed into the furnace for smelting to maintain an adequate supply of copper plates.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel)`: Failed due to missing iron plates.\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: Failed multiple times due to missing copper plates.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `final_inventory`: Inventory type (not defined, causing NameError).\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Inventory type (contains copper-plate and coal).\n  - `inventory`: Inventory type (contains stone-furnace, wood, coal, iron-plate, copper-plate, automation-science-pack)."}
