{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -54.5) moving items from Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, -54.5) to Wooden Chest at Position (-12.5, -54.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 0.0)\n- Multiple Wooden Chests storing copper ore and copper plates\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of materials between different entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Entity Interaction\n- Ensure that the correct API methods are used for interacting with entities. For example, when picking up an entity, use the appropriate method that matches the entity type and ensure the entity is callable.\n\n### Errors with Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. Empty chests at critical points to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source from which the inserter is supposed to pick up items is adequately stocked with the required materials. Regularly supply the source entities to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drills Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to avoid production stoppages. Set up a systematic refueling schedule or automate the refueling process to maintain continuous operation."}
