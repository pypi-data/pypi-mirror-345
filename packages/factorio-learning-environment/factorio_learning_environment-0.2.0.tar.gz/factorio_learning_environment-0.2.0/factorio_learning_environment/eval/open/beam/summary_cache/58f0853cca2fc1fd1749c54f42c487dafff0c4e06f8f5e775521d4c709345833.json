{"content": "The error indicates that the `pickup_entity` function is not working as expected, possibly due to the entity being non-removable in its current state. Instead, you should try removing the furnace using a different approach, such as directly removing or deconstructing it if possible. Let's try a different method:\n\n# Step 1: Attempt to deconstruct the existing furnace\n\n```python\n# Attempt to deconstruct the existing furnace\ndeconstruct_success = deconstruct_entity(furnace_entity)\n\n# Ensure that the deconstruction was successful\nassert deconstruct_success, \"Failed to deconstruct the existing furnace.\"\n\n# Step 2: Place a new stone furnace at a specified position\nnew_furnace_position = Position(x=0, y=0)\nnew_furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Direction.UP, new_furnace_position)\n\n# Validate successful placement\nassert new_furnace, \"Failed to place a new furnace at the specified position.\"\n\n# Step 3: Insert coal into the newly placed furnace\ntry:\n    coal_inserted = insert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=1)\n    assert coal_inserted, \"Failed to insert coal into the furnace.\"\n    print(\"Coal successfully inserted into the newly placed furnace.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Encountered an issue inserting coal after reinstallation: {e}\")\n\n# Allow time for processing\nsleep(10)\n\n# Verify the new furnace's inventory status\nfurnace_inventory_post_insertion = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(\"New furnace status after coal insertion: \", furnace_inventory_post_insertion)\n\n# Print out the current inventory and entities to ensure all is as expected\nprint(f\"Final Check on Player Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Current Entity Overview: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis approach attempts to deconstruct the existing furnace, which should remove it from the game world, allowing you to place a new one and proceed with the coal insertion. If `deconstruct_entity` is not available, you may need to explore other methods specific to your environment or game version.", "summary_range": "[1-94]"}
