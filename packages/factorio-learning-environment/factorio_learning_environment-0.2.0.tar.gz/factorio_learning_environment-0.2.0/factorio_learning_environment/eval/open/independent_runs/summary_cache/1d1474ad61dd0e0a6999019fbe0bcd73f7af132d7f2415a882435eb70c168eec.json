{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: 1 unit of coal\n  - Status: Working, but output is blocked by an item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore available\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest at the drill's drop position or new location**: Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place a wooden chest.\n- **Cannot place Transport Belt at the desired location**: Verify that the target location is clear and suitable for placing a transport belt.\n- **Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location**: Check that the target location is not blocked and is appropriate for placing a burner inserter.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- **Cannot move the Stone Furnace to the new location**: Confirm that the target location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move the stone furnace.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- **Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at specified position**: Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Output Blocked by Item on the Ground**: Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or another transport mechanism, to accept the output from the burner mining drill.\n- **No Ingredients to Smelt**: Ensure the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to process, such as iron ore, to avoid idle time."}
