Ensure that connection attempts reference the correct, active fluid_system identifier.\n  - Implement dynamic validations to verify PipeGroup availability before initiating a connection.\n\n\u2022 Redundant Stabilization Delays:\n  - The fixed 10-second wait after each failed connection attempt leads to unnecessary delays. Use real-time pipeline network status checks to reduce idle waiting.\n\n\u2022 Inadequate Water Supply Integration:\n  - The steam engine persistently reports \u201cno input liquid.\u201d Reexamine the connectivity between the offshore pump, boiler, and pipeline network to achieve proper water delivery."}
