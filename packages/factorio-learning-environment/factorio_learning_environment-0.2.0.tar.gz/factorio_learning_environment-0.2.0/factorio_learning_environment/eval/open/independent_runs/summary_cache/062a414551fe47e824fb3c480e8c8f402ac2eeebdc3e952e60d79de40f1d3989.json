{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler with pipes at positions (-46.5, -122.5), (-44.5, -122.5), (-45.5, -122.5), (-42.5, -123.5), (-42.5, -122.5), and (-43.5, -122.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting copper ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items between entities\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various structures, including positions such as (-39.5, -116.5), (-38.5, -115.5), (-42.5, -112.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Error in Obtaining Entity at Specific Position\n- Verify the position and existence of the entity before attempting to interact with it. In this case, the offshore pump was not found at the specified position (-47.5, -123.5). Ensure the correct position is targeted.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Working\n- Check connections and ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and receiving input liquid. Ensure that all pipes and connections are correctly configured to transport the necessary fluids."}
