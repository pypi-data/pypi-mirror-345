Verify connections and fluid types to prevent assertion errors.\n\n### Errors with Power Network Connections\n- Ensure you have the required items, such as Small Electric Poles, in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network.\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the power network to prevent warnings about lack of electricity.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Verify that entities requiring fuel, such as steam engines and furnaces, have the correct fuel type and are adequately supplied to avoid operational interruptions.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Ensure that you are accessing valid attributes of objects. For example, a 'Generator' object does not have a 'fuel' attribute. Check the documentation for correct attribute usage."}
