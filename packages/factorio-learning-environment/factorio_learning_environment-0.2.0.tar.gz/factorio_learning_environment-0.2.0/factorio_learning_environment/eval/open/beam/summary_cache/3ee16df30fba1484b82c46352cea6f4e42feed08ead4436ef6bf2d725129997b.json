{"content": "The attempt to load Copper Ore into the active furnace has once again resulted in an unexpected outcome:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace remains empty after the attempt to insert **1 piece of Copper Ore**.\n- The furnace is still in a **\"WORKING\"** state but does not recognize any materials for processing, and its status shows **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"** for smelting.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **1 piece of stone** remaining.\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is operational but does not acknowledge the Copper Ore for smelting, indicating a persistent issue with either the recipe configuration or the input recognition.\n- The recipe for the furnace seems to be set only for stone, which is preventing the processing of Copper Ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check the Furnace Recipe Again**: I will need to confirm the furnace's recipe configuration to ensure it allows for the smelting of Copper Ore.\n2. **Consider Resetting the Furnace**: If the recipe is misconfigured, I may need to clear any inputs and reinsert the necessary materials.\n3. **Reinsert Copper Ore**: After confirming the recipe and clearing the furnace, I will attempt to load the Copper Ore again.\n\nLet's proceed to check the recipe configuration and confirm the ability to smelt Copper Ore. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Retrieve the current recipe details and operational status from the active furnace\nfurnace_recipe_details = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.StoneFurnace)  \nprint(f\"Active Furnace Recipe Details: {furnace_recipe_details}\")  # Display the recipe information in detail.\n\n# Check the inventory status to verify current contents\ncurrent_active_furnace_status = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Check the current status of the active furnace.\nprint(f\"Current Active Furnace Status: {current_active_furnace_status}\")  # Show active furnace details including contents and status. \n\n# Verify the complete inventory while observing for issues in tracking.\nprint(f\"Complete Inventory Status After Inspecting: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Display the total inventory after thorough inspection.", "summary_range": "[1-350]"}
