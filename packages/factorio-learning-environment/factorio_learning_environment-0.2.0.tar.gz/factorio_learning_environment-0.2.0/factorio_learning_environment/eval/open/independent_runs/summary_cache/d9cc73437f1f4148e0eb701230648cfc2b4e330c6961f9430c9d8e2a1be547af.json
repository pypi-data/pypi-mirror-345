{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=52.5, y=-77.5) for storing coal.\n- Additional burner inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-76.5) to move coal from the belt to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) currently lacking ingredients.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-48.5) working to move iron ore from the belt to the chest.\n- Additional burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Chests\n- Ensure that belts are connected to an inserter before connecting to a wooden chest. Direct connection of belts to a wooden chest is not possible and will result in an error.\n\n### Inserter Position Misalignment\n- Ensure that the inserter pickup position is aligned with the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) to avoid misalignment errors.\n\n### Fuel Management for Burner Entities\n- Regularly check and refuel burner entities to prevent them from running out of fuel and stopping operations.\n\n### Ingredient Supply for Furnaces\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process materials, as lack of ingredients will halt production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **connect_entities**: A utility function intended to connect entities using transport belts. It failed when attempting to connect directly to a wooden chest, indicating the need for an inserter in between.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `belts`: Intended to store the connection of entities using transport belts, type: List[Prototype.TransportBelt].\n  - `coal_drill`: Represents the burner mining drill for coal extraction, type: Entity.\n  - `coal_chest`: Represents the wooden chest for coal storage, type: Entity.\n"}
