{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output still blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0), fueled with coal and operational, frequently full on output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), fueled and operational, moving items between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt persists, limiting mining drill throughput.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and iron plate storage with stable power and inserter fueling, but output congestion remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5), fueled and working.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5), connected by pipes and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and pole at (15.5, 75.5) supplying power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates steam power and supplies electricity to the factory.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and fueled but unable to craft due to missing iron plates.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates directly into assembler.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty, with burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and moving items.\n- Assembling machine input and output inventories show iron plates and iron gear wheels only transiently; output chest remains empty.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and inserter fueling stable, but no gear wheels are accumulating in output chest due to extraction issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Output chest empty despite assembling machine producing items\n- Attempts to extract iron gear wheels from output chest at (25.5, 82.5) repeatedly fail due to chest being empty.\n- Ensure that output inserter at (25.5, 83.5) is correctly picking up assembled gear wheels from assembling machine output.\n- Verify inserter directions and positions to confirm items are moved into output chest.\n- Monitor assembling machine output inventory and output chest inventory to detect bottlenecks.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items despite iron plates present\n- Inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) report waiting for source items warnings, indicating temporary lack of items to move.\n- Check that input chests at (21.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 77.5) have sufficient iron plates and that inserters can access them.\n- Maintain steady supply of iron plates to input chests to avoid inserter starvation.\n\n### Coal inventory depletion causing insertion failures\n- Failure to insert coal into furnace at (18.0, 75.0) due to no coal available in inventory.\n- Monitor coal stock levels and ensure sufficient coal is reserved for fueling furnaces and inserters.\n- Automate coal supply or manually replenish coal to prevent production stoppages.\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt affecting mining drill\n- Electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report output blockage due to furnace belt congestion.\n- Clear or extend output belts and chests to accept smelted iron plates and prevent furnace output inventory from filling.\n- This will unblock mining drill output and improve overall throughput.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts remain resolved\n- Previous issues with small electric pole placement near steam engine resolved; no new placement conflicts reported.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo new functions defined by the agent in the recent steps."}
