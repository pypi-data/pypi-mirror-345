# collection

Collection is an [abstract data type](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/abstract_data_type.md) that groups some variable number of [data structures](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/foundamental/data_structure.md) (possibly zero) that have some shared significance to the problem being solved and need to be [operated](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/foundamental/operation.md) upon together in some controlled fashion.
