{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of four stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0)  \n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have coal fuel but currently no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Research Lab Setup\n- Lab at (10.5, 0.5)\n- Contains 2 automation science packs\n- Connected to power network but currently has no power\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around y=24 coordinates:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) connected via pipes to pump\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5) connected via pipes to boiler\n- Small electric poles connecting the power network\n- Pipe network connecting water flow between components:\n  - Pipe group from pump to boiler (working, contains water)\n  - Pipe group from boiler to steam engine (empty)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to craft items\n- When crafting complex items, check if all sub-components can be crafted or need to be smelted first\n\n### Recipe Requirements Errors\n- Some items like copper plates and iron plates require smelting in furnaces, cannot be crafted directly\n- Raw resources like wood need to be gathered, they cannot be crafted\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Verify you have the required entity in inventory before attempting placement\n- When placing connected systems (like power/water), ensure you have all required components\n\n### Programming/API Errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations on ModelPrivateAttr objects directly\n- When connecting entities, ensure you have the connecting items (like pipes) in inventory first\n\n### Resource Processing\n- Keep furnaces stocked with both fuel and ore to maintain continuous production\n- Extract processed materials from furnaces before they become idle"}
