Verify the positions of the pipe-to-ground entities to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Check for existing objects in the target location before placing pipes. Ensure the target tile is clear of any obstructions to avoid placement failures.\n- Avoid placing pipe-to-ground entities on water tiles as their footprint cannot overlap water. Choose a different location that is suitable for placement.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place them. Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid running out of essential items like pipes."}
