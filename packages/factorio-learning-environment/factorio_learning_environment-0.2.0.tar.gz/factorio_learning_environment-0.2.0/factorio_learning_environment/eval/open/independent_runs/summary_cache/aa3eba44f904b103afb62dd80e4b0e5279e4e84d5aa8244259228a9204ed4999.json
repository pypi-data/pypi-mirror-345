{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal) and inventory for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Second stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.1) with inventory for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- Errors occurred when attempting to craft a stone furnace due to missing the required sub-ingredient (stone). Ensure to gather necessary raw resources before crafting items.\n- Ensure that the furnace has the required ingredients to smelt. The furnace reported 'no ingredients to smelt', indicating that the input resources were insufficient.\n- Not enough resources to craft another stone furnace. Ensure that you have the required materials (stone and iron plates) in sufficient quantities before attempting to craft.\n- Not enough iron plates to craft an assembling machine. Gather more iron plates before attempting to craft the assembling machine.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: \n  - `craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)`: Failed due to missing sub-ingredients.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory: dict`: Current inventory of items (e.g., {'stone': 5, 'iron-plate': 4}).\n  - `entities: list`: List of entities on the map (includes two stone furnaces).\n  - `furnace_inventory: dict`: Inventory of the stone furnace (e.g., {'iron-ore': 4, 'iron-plate': 5} after smelting)."}
