{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates/cables. (Current state: fuel remaining coal: 31, iron-plate output available, warning \"no ingredients to smelt\" persists.)\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the output from the furnace. (Note: The original chest was picked up and replaced with a new chest at the same position; however, insertion of iron plates into the new chest failed as its inventory remains empty.)\n- Burner inserter initially positioned at (48.5, -81.5) was picked up during the recent steps and its re-placement failed due to a conflict with an adjacent chest occupying the target tile.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Insertion Failures into Targeted Containers\n- Verify that the target container\u2019s inventory is actively updated immediately after placement. Confirm the container accepts items (e.g. re-validate after pickup and replacement) before initiating insertion operations.\n- Investigate the conditions that lead to the new chest not updating its inventory after insertion to avoid assertion failures.\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- When placing entities adjacent to existing structures, ensure that target tiles are free. In cases where placement fails due to a pre-existing container (e.g. wooden chest), consider adjusting spacing, reference positions, or placement direction to prevent overlaps.\n\n### Inventory and API Argument Errors\n- Continually verify that sufficient inventory is present and that API calls reference the correct entities. Maintain consistency in entity references during transitions (such as picking up and replacing entities) to mitigate repeated assertion and argument errors."}
