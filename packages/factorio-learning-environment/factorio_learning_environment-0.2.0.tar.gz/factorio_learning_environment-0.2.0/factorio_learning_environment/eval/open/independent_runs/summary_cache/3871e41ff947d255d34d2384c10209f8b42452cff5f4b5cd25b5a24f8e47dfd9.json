{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-10, 25)\nConsists of boiler (position -10.5, 25.5) and offshore pump (position -4.5, 24.0)\n\n### Laboratory at position(4, -12)\nConsists of laboratory (position 4.5, -12.5)\n\n### Electric pole placements\n- Electric pole near boiler (attempted position -5.5, 24.0)\n- Electric pole near lab (attempted position 4.5, -12.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to offshore pump\n- Ensure that the pipes are placed correctly and that the direction is specified when placing pipes.\n- The second argument must be a Direction object when placing pipes.\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure there is sufficient space to place the electric pole. Check for existing objects in the way before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
