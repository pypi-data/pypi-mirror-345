{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0), processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to the output chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5), collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Non-Existent or Empty Entities\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., wooden chest) contains the required items before attempting to extract. Verify the entity's inventory to confirm item availability.\n\n### Errors when Inserting into Full Inventories\n- Check the inventory capacity of the target entity (e.g., stone furnace) before attempting to insert items. Ensure there is sufficient space to accommodate the items being inserted.\n\n### Errors when Crafting without Required Resources\n- Gather all necessary raw resources (e.g., wood) before attempting to craft items. Verify that you have the required ingredients in your inventory to avoid crafting failures.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities without Inventory\n- Confirm that you have the necessary entities (e.g., wooden chests) in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map."}
