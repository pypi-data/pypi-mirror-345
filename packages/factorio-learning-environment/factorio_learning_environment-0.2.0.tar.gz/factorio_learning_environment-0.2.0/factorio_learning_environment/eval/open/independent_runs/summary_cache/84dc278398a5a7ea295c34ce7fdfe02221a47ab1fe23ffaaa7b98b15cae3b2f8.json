{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) and steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5). The boiler is currently working and has coal as fuel, while the steam engine is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine at position -21.5, 25.5\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\nConsists of the offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5) which is currently working and supplying water.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, including the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that the pipes are placed correctly and that there is a clear path for connection between the boiler and steam engine. Check the coordinates to confirm that the pipes are aligned properly.\n\n### Errors when inserting items from inventory\n- Confirm that the items you are trying to insert are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any entity. In this case, ensure you have coal available for the boiler.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may block placement."}
