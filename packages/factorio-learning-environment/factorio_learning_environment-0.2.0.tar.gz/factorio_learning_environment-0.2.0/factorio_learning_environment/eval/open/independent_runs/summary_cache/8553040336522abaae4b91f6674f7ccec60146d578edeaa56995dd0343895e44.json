{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace Array\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position x1) and stone furnace (position y1)\n- Stone furnace (position x2) and stone furnace (position y2)\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Input System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter (position a) that puts coal into the first stone furnace\n- Inserter (position b) that puts iron ore into the first stone furnace\n- Inserter (position c) that puts iron ore into the second stone furnace\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place. \n\n### Repeated actions without change\n- Avoid repeating the same actions (like inserting into furnaces) without checking if it is necessary. This can lead to inefficiencies in resource management."}
