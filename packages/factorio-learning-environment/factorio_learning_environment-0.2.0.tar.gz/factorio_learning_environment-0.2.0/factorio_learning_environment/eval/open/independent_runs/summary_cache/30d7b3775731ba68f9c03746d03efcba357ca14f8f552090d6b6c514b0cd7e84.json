{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) producing iron plates.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) feeding copper ore into a transport belt system.\n- Transport Belt system connecting the mining drill to the furnace, with belts at positions (-24.5, -69.5) to (-21.5, -66.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items, intended to insert items into the furnace at (-19.0, -65.0).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the chest to another chest at (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Transport Belt system facilitating movement of items between entities.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage Chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Additional empty wooden chests at various positions for future storage needs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Connections\n- Ensure continuous placement of transport belts without gaps to successfully connect entities. Verify belt placement at position (-20.5, -65.5) to avoid gaps.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into a furnace, confirm that the required items (e.g., iron ore) are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Ensure that the supply chain feeding the inserter is intact and functioning correctly to prevent the inserter from waiting indefinitely."}
