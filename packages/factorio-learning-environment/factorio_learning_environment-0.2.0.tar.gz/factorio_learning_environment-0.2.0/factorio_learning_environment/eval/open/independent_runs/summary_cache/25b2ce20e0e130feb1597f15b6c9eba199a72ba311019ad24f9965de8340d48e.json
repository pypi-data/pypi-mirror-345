Check for any entities that may block the connection before placing pipes.\n\n### Errors when using electricity\n- Make sure that all electrical entities are properly connected to the power network. Verify the connections of electric poles and ensure they are within range of the structures they are meant to power.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may occupy the intended placement area.\n\n### Errors with fluid connections\n- Verify that the offshore pump has access to a fluid source and that all connections are clear of obstructions. Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to the offshore pump for fluid transfer."}
