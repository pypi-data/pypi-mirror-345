Its fluid system identifier has recently updated to 57639.\n\u2022 Multiple steam engines installed at (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5) and (4.5, 23.5) to convert steam into energy.\n\u2022 An extra steam engine remains unplaced due to persistent spatial congestion in the boiler zone.\n\n### Automated Mining Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A burner mining drill, burner inserters and a wooden chest arranged for resource extraction.\n\u2022 (No updates since the previous report.)\n\n### Smelting Process Cluster\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Stone furnaces accompanied by burner inserters and wooden chests configured to convert raw ores into plates.\n\u2022 (No updates since the previous report.)\n\n### Fluid and Electrical Infrastructure\nConsists of:\n\u2022 An offshore pump delivering water, several pipe groups forming a fluid distribution network, electricity groups interlinking power poles, and belt groups connecting production zones.\n\u2022 (No updates since the previous report.)\n\n### Research Lab Network\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Lab units dedicated to automation research and science pack processing, along with associated electrical components.\n\u2022 (No updates since the previous report; power connectivity issues persist.)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue:\n  \u2013 The extra steam engine remains unplaceable because of severe spatial congestion within the boiler zone. Overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts\u2014especially around the (8.5, 22.5) connection region\u2014are the primary contributors.\n  \u2013 Mitigation strategies include removing or repositioning conflicting entities, redesigning adjacent connection interfaces to expand the buildable space, or relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested area.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Network Connection Warnings:\n  \u2013 Several steam engines report being disconnected from the power network and lacking proper liquid input.\n  \u2013 Verify that the connection points of each steam engine align accurately with the boiler\u2019s steam output and ensure that both electrical and fluid piping are correctly integrated.\n\n\u2022 Research Lab Power Connectivity Issue:\n  \u2013 Lab units continue to exhibit a NO_POWER status, indicating persistent power network integration problems.\n  \u2013 Reassess and reconfigure the electrical network layout to ensure lab components are correctly connected to the primary power grid."}
