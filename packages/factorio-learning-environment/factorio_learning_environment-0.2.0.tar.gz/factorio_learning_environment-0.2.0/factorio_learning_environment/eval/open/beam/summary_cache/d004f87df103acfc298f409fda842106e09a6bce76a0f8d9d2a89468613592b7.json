This ongoing issue indicates that the environment may be experiencing a persistent problem that prevents it from returning outputs or executing commands effectively.\n\nTo address this situation, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Environment Reset**: If possible, initiate a reset of the environment to clear any potential issues that may be causing it to hang or become unresponsive.\n\n2. **Check System Logs**: If you have access to any logs or error messages from the environment, review them to identify any underlying issues that may need to be addressed.\n\n3. **Simplify Commands**: When the environment is restored, start with simpler commands or actions to ensure that basic functionality is working before moving on to more complex tasks.\n\n4. **Incremental Testing**: After the reset, test one functionality at a time to isolate any potential problems and confirm that each component is working as expected.\n\n5. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on the performance of the environment after the reset to ensure that it remains stable and responsive.\n\nIf you have any specific actions you would like me to take or if there are further instructions on how to proceed, please let me know!", "summary_range": "[1-130]"}
