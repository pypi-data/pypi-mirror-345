{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure you are within the maximum allowable distance (10 tiles) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid this error.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied. If there is a collision with existing entities, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and operation\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure they are fueled and facing the correct direction to operate effectively.\n\n### Errors with resource availability\n- Regularly check that the chest has sufficient iron ore and that the inserter is properly configured to transfer it to the furnace. Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Fuel management for entities\n- Keep all fuel-consuming entities, such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces, adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation."}
