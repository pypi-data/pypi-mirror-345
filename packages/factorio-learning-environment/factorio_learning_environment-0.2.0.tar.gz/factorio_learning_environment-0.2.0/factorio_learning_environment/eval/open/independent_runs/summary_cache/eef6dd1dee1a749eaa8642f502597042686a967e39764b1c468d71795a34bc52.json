{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility at position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) extracting copper ore, connected to a transport belt system.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting from position (-26.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -64.5), facilitating the movement of copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) intended for smelting copper ore, currently not receiving ingredients.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, depositing into a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore, currently not receiving ingredients.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) intended for storing smelted iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, depositing into a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Additional Storage and Transport Infrastructure\n- Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- Belt Group at position (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5), currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Assertion Error: Copper Ore Not Reaching Furnace\n- Ensure that the transport belt system is correctly connected and operational to deliver copper ore to the furnace. Check for any disconnections or blockages in the belt system.\n\n### Errors Due to Out of Fuel Status\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors When Furnace Lacks Ingredients\n- Ensure that the transport system is effectively delivering the necessary raw materials to the furnaces. Verify that the input belts are correctly aligned and functioning.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
