{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) supplied with iron ore and coal, currently working.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) supplied with iron ore and coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) with pickup position (-13.5, -48.5) and drop position (-13.5, -46.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) with pickup position (-14.5, -46.5) and drop position (-14.5, -44.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-9.5, -44.5) with pickup position (-8.5, -44.5) and drop position (-10.5, -44.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-14.5, -43.5) with pickup position (-14.5, -44.5) and drop position (-14.5, -42.5), waiting for source items.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5).\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5).\n- **Transport Belts**:\n  - Belt at position (-16.5, -47.5) outputting towards (-16.5, -46.5).\n  - Belt at position (-14.5, -46.5) outputting towards (-14.5, -47.5).\n  - Belt at position (-12.5, -46.5) outputting towards (-11.5, -46.5).\n  - BeltGroup connecting various positions for material transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters without source items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items to pick up. Check the supply chain to confirm that items are being delivered to the inserters.\n\n### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Make sure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to continue smelting operations. Regularly check and replenish the supply of raw materials.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that the inserters are correctly positioned and have access to the items they are supposed to pick up. Adjust the position or supply chain if necessary to ensure smooth operation."}
