{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has once again not resulted in the expected outcome:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now holds **3 pieces of stone** after the loading attempt.\n- The furnace is in a **\"WORKING\"** state, but it still does not show any products being processed, indicating that it is not recognizing the Copper Ore for smelting.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n  - **1 piece of stone** remaining (after loading).\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not processing any materials despite being in a working state, and it still requires **5 pieces of stone** to enable the recipe.\n- The Copper Ore has not been loaded yet, which is necessary for smelting.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract the Remaining Stone**: I need to extract the **3 pieces of stone** from the furnace to reset it completely.\n2. **Load the Copper Ore**: After clearing the stone, I will insert the **1 piece of Copper Ore** into the furnace.\n3. **Monitor the Smelting Operation**: Observe closely to ensure that the furnace begins processing the Copper Ore into Copper Plates.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to extract the stone from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the remaining stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Extract all 3 pieces of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-342]"}
