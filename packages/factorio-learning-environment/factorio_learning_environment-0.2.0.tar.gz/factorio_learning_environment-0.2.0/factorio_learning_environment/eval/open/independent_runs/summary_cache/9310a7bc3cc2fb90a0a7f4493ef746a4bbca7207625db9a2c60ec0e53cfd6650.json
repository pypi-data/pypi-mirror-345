{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) that stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the intended position.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target position is not occupied by another entity or obstructed by terrain features like water. Adjust the position, spacing, or direction to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and functionality\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and powered to ensure they can transfer items between entities. Reposition if necessary and ensure they have fuel if they are burner inserters.\n\n### Errors with insufficient resources in processing\n- Ensure that the chest has sufficient resources (iron ore) for the inserter to transfer to the furnace. Regularly check and replenish resources as needed.\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Regularly refuel entities like burner inserters and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Keep a stock of coal or other fuel sources in your inventory for refueling purposes."}
