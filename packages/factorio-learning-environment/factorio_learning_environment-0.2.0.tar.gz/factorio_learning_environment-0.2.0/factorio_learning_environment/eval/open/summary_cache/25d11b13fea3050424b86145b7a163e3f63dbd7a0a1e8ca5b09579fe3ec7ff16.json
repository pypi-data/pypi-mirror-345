{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) intended to move iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport belt at position (21.5, 73.5) placed to move iron plates away from the chest.\n\nThis structure forms a connected iron plate production line from ore extraction to plate output onto a belt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel management for burner entities\n- Burner inserters, drills, and furnaces require coal fuel to operate. Frequent \"No coal in inventory to fuel burner inserter\" and \"EntityStatus.NO_FUEL\" errors indicate insufficient or untimely fueling.\n- Always ensure coal is harvested and inserted into burner entities promptly to avoid stoppages. Automate or schedule coal insertion to maintain continuous operation.\n- Track coal inventory carefully before attempting to fuel entities to prevent insertion failures.\n\n### Inventory and insertion errors due to empty inventory\n- Multiple errors occurred when attempting to insert coal from inventory despite it being empty. Always verify inventory contents before insertion commands.\n- Implement checks to confirm sufficient items exist in inventory before insertion attempts to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Inserter waiting states and blocking\n- Inserters frequently report waiting for source items or waiting for space in destination, indicating upstream or downstream blockages.\n- Ensure upstream entities (e.g., mining drill) are fueled and producing items, and downstream entities or belts have capacity to receive items to prevent inserter blocking.\n- Clearing chest inventories or moving items away from chests can help alleviate blocking.\n\n### Placement order and spacing considerations\n- Initial failures placing transport belts and inserters due to occupied tiles were resolved by adjusting placement spacing and order.\n- Plan entity placement carefully to avoid overlaps and ensure all entities have free tiles for placement.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
