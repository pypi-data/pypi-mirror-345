{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities at a Distance\n- Ensure you are within the maximum allowable distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the intended position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied or Invalid Positions\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is not occupied by another entity or unsuitable for placement (e.g., water). Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and configured to transfer items between entities. Check the inserter's position and direction to ensure it can pick up and drop items as intended.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as inserters and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Ensure you have adequate coal or other fuel sources in your inventory to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Empty or Low Inventory\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests and other storage entities to avoid running out of essential materials. Extract items or refuel as necessary to maintain efficient production."}
