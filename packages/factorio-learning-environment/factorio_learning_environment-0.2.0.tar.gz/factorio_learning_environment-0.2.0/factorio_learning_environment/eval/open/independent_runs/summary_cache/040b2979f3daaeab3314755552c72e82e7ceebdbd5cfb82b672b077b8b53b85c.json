To mitigate this, always verify that the target entity is suitable for belt input and add an inserter to feed items into the target rather than connecting to a SteamEngine directly.\n\n\u2022 Errors due to placement distance limitations  \n\u2003\u2013 An error occurred when trying to place a wooden chest at (3.5,15.5) while the player was too far away. Ensure the player is within the allowed maximum placement distance before attempting to place an entity.\n\n\u2022 Name resolution errors  \n\u2003\u2013 A NameError (\u201ctarget_chest\u201d not defined) indicates that a referenced variable was not properly declared. Confirm that all variables are defined and correctly named before use.\n\n\u2022 Errors caused by insufficient inventory  \n\u2003\u2013 An attempt to place a wooden chest failed because the required item was not available in the inventory. Always check inventory counts or craft the needed item prior to placement."}
