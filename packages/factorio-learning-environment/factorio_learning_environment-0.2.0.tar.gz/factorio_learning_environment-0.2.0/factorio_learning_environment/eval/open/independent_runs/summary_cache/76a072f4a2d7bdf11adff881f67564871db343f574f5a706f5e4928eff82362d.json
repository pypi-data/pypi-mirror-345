{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)  \n- **Wooden chest** at position (41.5, -80.5)  \n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear and buildable before placing entities like transport belts, mining drills, or furnaces.  \n  - Example: `Cannot place transport belt at x=42.5 y=-80.5 - position not buildable`  \n  - Example: `Cannot place burner mining drill at x=-15.5 y=-50.5 - position not buildable`  \n  - Example: `Cannot place wooden chest at x=-14.5 y=-48.5 - position not buildable`  \n  - Example: `Cannot place stone furnace at x=42.5 y=-80.5 - position not buildable`  \n\n#### Errors when referencing undefined variables\n- Ensure variables like `transport_belt` are defined before referencing them in conditional statements.  \n  - Example: `NameError: name 'transport_belt' is not defined`  \n\n#### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of entities at specific positions before attempting to interact with them.  \n  - Example: `Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-13.5 y=-44.5`  \n\n#### Errors when inserting items into non-existent or incompatible entities\n- Ensure the target entity exists and can accept the item before attempting to insert.  \n  - Example: `Could not insert: Could not find a nearby entity that can accept coal`  \n\n#### General Tips\n- Double-check entity positions and ensure they are valid before performing actions.  \n- Use debugging tools or logs to verify the state of the game before executing commands."}
