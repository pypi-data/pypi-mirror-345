Ensure that the selected fluid_system reference matches the currently active PipeGroup (now [6988]) before attempting a connection.\n\n\u2022 Pipeline Stabilization and Alignment:\n  - Confirm that all pipe segments are precisely aligned and clear of obstructions, and allow sufficient stabilization time between connection attempts to ensure the pipeline network is fully operational.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine and Power Network Configuration:\n  - Verify that the steam engine maintains proper integration with both a functioning pipeline network (using valid fluid_system references) and an active electricity network (ElectricityGroup id updated to 2312) to eliminate persistent connection warnings."}
