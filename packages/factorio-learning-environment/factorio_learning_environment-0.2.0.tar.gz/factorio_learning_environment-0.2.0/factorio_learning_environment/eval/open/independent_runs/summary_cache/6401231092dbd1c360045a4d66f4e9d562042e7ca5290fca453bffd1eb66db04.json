{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (x=1-4, y=1-4)\nConsists of two parallel smelting setups:\n- Stone furnace at (1,1) with burner inserter at (1.5,2.5) and output chest at (1.5,3.5)\n- Stone furnace at (3,1) with burner inserter at (3.5,2.5) and output chest at (3.5,3.5)\nBoth setups are actively smelting iron ore with coal as fuel\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (x=2-5, y=7-10)\nConsists of two parallel smelting setups:\n- Stone furnace at (2,7) with burner inserter at (2.5,8.5) and output chest at (2.5,9.5)\n- Stone furnace at (4,7) with burner inserter at (4.5,8.5) and output chest at (4.5,9.5)\n- Additional burner inserter at (3.5,9.5) connecting the two lines\nCurrently idle due to no ingredients\n\n### Transport Belt Network (x=2.5-13.5, y=8.5-16.5)\nMultiple interconnected belt groups forming a logistics network:\n- East-west belt connection from (2.5,8.5) to (4.5,8.5)\n- Extended belt network from (4.5,8.5) to (13.5,10.5)\n- North-south belt connections at multiple points\nAll belts currently empty\n\n### Assembly Line Setup (x=14.5-21.5, y=11.5-15.5)\nTwo assembly machines with supporting infrastructure:\n- Copper cable assembler at (14.5,14.5) with input chest at (14.5,11.5)\n- Electronic circuit assembler at (21.5,15.5) with input chest at (21.5,11.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters and chests for material handling\nCurrently not operating due to lack of power\n\n### Power Generation System (x=2.5-13.5, y=35.5)\nComplete but non-functioning power setup:\n- Offshore pump at (2.5,35.5) producing water\n- Boiler at (7.0,35.5) connected via pipes but lacking fuel\n- Steam engine at (13.5,35.5) not receiving steam\n- Pipe network connecting components with water present in initial sections\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Ensure boiler has fuel (coal) to heat water\n- Complete pipe connections between boiler and steam engine to allow steam flow\n\n### Assembly Machine Issues\n- Connect power to assembly machines before attempting production\n- Ensure proper material input supply chains are established before starting production\n\n### Resource Management\n- Verify required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items\n- Check recipe requirements and ensure sufficient materials are in inventory\n\n### Entity Placement\n- Ensure proper connections between fluid-carrying entities (pipes, boilers, pumps)\n- Verify transport belt connections are properly aligned and connected"}
