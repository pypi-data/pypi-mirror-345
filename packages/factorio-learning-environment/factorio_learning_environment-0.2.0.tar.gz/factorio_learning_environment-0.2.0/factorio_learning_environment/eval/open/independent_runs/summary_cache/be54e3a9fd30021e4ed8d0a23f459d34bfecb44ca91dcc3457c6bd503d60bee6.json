For instance, ensure coal is available before trying to insert it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors due to lack of electricity\n- Connect all machines and inserters to a power source to ensure they receive electricity and function correctly. Check connections regularly to avoid power outages.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available for production processes. For example, ensure copper plates are available for copper cable production in the assembling machine."}
