{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) [Status: WORKING]\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) [Status: NO_FUEL]\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) [Status: NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Pipe Group at positions (-4.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5) [Status: EMPTY and FULL_OUTPUT]\n\n### Electric Network\nConsists of Small Electric Poles:\n- Pole at position (-3.5, 18.5) connected to network at (1.5, 18.5)\n- Pole at position (1.5, 20.5) connected to network at (-3.5, 18.5)\n- Pole at position (-1.5, 19.5) connected to network at (1.5, 20.5)\n- Pole at position (-1.5, 21.5) connected to network at (-1.5, 19.5)\n- Pole at position (0.5, 18.5) connected to network at (-1.5, 21.5)\n- Pole at position (0.5, 20.5) connected to network at (0.5, 18.5)\n- Pole at position (0.5, 23.5) connected to network at (0.5, 20.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) [Status: NO_INGREDIENTS]\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting and Inventory Management\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates are needed to craft copper cables, which are necessary for crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Placing and Connecting Entities\n- Verify that there is sufficient inventory before attempting to place entities like small electric poles.\n- Ensure that all entities are properly connected to the electric network to avoid issues like \"NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\".\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Double-check pipe connections between entities such as offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines to ensure they are properly connected.\n\n### Errors in Extracting and Inserting Items\n- Move closer to the target entity before attempting to extract items.\n- Ensure that the correct items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like stone furnaces.\n\n### Code and Logic Errors\n- Review and debug any code errors, such as \"IndexError: list index out of range\", to ensure that logic is correctly implemented and that lists or arrays are properly indexed."}
