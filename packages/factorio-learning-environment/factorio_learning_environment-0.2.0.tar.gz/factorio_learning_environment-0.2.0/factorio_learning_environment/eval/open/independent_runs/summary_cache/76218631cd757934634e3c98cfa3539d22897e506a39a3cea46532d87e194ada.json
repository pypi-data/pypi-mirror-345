{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 40-47)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) connected to pipe at (-8.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 3.5) with fuel inventory (50/50 coal)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 3.5) producing 13,500 kW\n- Connected pipe network (water system ID 938, steam system ID 940)\n- Coal buffer system:\n  - Wooden chest at (-7.5, 7.5) containing 200 coal\n  - Burner inserter at (-6.5, 7.5) (fueled, operational)\n\n### Oil Extraction and Storage System at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) working at 100% efficiency (300,000 crude oil remaining)\n- Storage tanks at:\n  - (22.5, 40.5) containing 12,450 crude oil\n  - (27.5, 40.5) containing 8,920 crude oil\n  - (32.5, 40.5) containing 5,310 crude oil\n- Connected pipe network (crude oil system ID 941) spanning 18.5,38.5 to 30.5,41.5\n- Power network (ID 5092) with 468 small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical System Failures\n- Power system completely failed due to fuel exhaustion - implement automated fuel monitoring\n- Water flow blocked at (-8.5,-0.5) - add secondary water pipeline redundancy\n- Pumpjack lost power connection - establish backup power connections\n\n### Emergency Procedures\n- Documented shutdown procedure was effective but manual restart failed initially\n- Need standardized recovery checklists for:\n  - Power system verification\n  - Fluid flow restoration\n  - Production system reactivation\n\n### System Monitoring\n- No early warning for fuel levels below 20%\n- Power grid stability sensors needed\n- Fluid flow rate indicators required\n\n### Maintenance Improvements\n- Scheduled inspections every 4 hours implemented\n- Fuel reserve monitoring now active\n- Performance benchmarking in place\n- Emergency drill scheduling established\n\n### Redundancy Requirements\n- Critical systems need duplicate components:\n  - Secondary water pipeline\n  - Backup power connections\n  - Dual fuel delivery system"}
