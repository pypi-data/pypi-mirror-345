The crafting recipe for the Assembling Machine 1 requires **9 iron plates**.\n\n### Immediate Next Steps:\n1. **Continue Smelting Iron Ore**: I need to keep the new Stone Furnace operational to produce more iron plates. I can insert additional iron ore if necessary.\n   \n2. **Gather More Resources**: If I have any remaining iron ore in my inventory, I should use it to ensure the furnace can keep smelting.\n\n3. **Plan for Future Resource Collection**: Consider gathering more iron ore and coal to maintain a steady supply for both furnaces.\n\n### Action Plan:\nLet\u2019s check if I have any iron ore left in my inventory and insert it into the new furnace for further smelting. If I have iron ore, I will insert it; if not, I will need to gather more from the original furnace or nearby resources.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the current inventory for any remaining iron ore\ncurrent_inventory_check = inspect_inventory()\nremaining_iron_ore = current_inventory_check.get('iron-ore', 0)\n\n# If I have iron ore, insert it into the new furnace for smelting\nif remaining_iron_ore > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, new_furnace, quantity=remaining_iron_ore)  # Insert all remaining iron ore into the new Stone Furnace\n    print(f\"Inserted {remaining_iron_ore} pieces of iron ore into the new furnace.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No remaining iron ore in inventory.
