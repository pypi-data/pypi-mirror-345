{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) fueled by coal and processing iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Extraction Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) fueled by coal and processing iron ore into iron plates\n- Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) storing coal\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) waiting for source items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Iron Ore\n- Ensure that the wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) contains iron ore before attempting to extract. Check the inventory of the chest to confirm the presence of iron ore.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Coal\n- Ensure that the iron chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) contains coal before attempting to extract. Verify the inventory of the chest to confirm the presence of coal.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities for inserters at positions (x=43.5, y=-80.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) have items available for transfer. Ensure that the production line is not stalled due to a lack of input materials.\n\n### Warnings for Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty the chests at drop positions such as (x=41.5, y=-80.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items into Furnaces\n- Ensure that there are available items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces. Check your inventory to confirm the presence of the required items."}
