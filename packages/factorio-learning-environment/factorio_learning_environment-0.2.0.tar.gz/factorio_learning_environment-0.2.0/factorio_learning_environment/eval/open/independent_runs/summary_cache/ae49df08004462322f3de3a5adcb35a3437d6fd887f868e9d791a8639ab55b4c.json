Double-check the position and the entity type.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft an item whose recipe is not yet unlocked\n- Before crafting an item, ensure that the required technology has been researched to unlock its recipe. Check the technology tree and research the necessary technologies first.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft an item with missing ingredients\n- Before crafting an item, ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available in sufficient quantities. If a sub-ingredient cannot be crafted, identify the reason (e.g., missing recipe, missing ingredients) and address it accordingly. In the case of smelting, ensure the furnace has fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- assembling_machine_position: Position\n```"}
