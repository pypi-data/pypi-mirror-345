{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron ore (10,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n  - Pickup Position: (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (-14.5, -46.5)\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (35 units)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Inventory: Iron plate (2 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Neighbours: Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (-2.5, 0.5)\n  - Drop Position: (-0.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For instance, attempting to insert coal when there is none in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Make sure that the output of a mining drill or any production entity is not blocked by items on the ground. Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output.\n\n### Errors when furnace is not receiving ingredients\n- Verify that the furnace has a consistent supply of required ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to maintain production. Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned and fueled to transfer items into the furnace."}
