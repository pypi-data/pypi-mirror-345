{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Additional Infrastructure\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Electricity Network with poles at various positions including (x=24.5, y=-7.5) and (x=-2.5, y=2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items into Lab\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a lab or any other structure.\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have enough materials before attempting to craft items. For example, ensure you have enough Iron Plates to craft Iron Gear Wheels.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters without Power\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to a power source to function properly. Check the electricity network and ensure that all poles and connections are correctly placed and powered.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of steam. Ensure that all pipes and connections are correctly aligned and that there is a sufficient supply of water and fuel to the boiler."}
