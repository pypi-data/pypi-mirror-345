{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with an inventory containing 6 coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) with an inventory containing 3 coal, successfully mining coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) with an inventory containing 8 iron plates and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from the Wooden Chest\n- Ensure the Wooden Chest has enough coal before attempting to extract. The inventory shows that it can run low, which may cause extraction to yield less than expected.\n\n### Errors when the Burner Mining Drill is not collecting\n- The Burner Mining Drill may stop collecting if the drop position (the Wooden Chest) is full. Empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to continue mining.\n\n### Errors when the Burner Mining Drill has insufficient fuel\n- Monitor the fuel levels in the Burner Mining Drill to ensure it has enough coal to operate efficiently. If it runs low, extraction from the Wooden Chest should be prioritized.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- Functions defined:\n  - None reported in the logs.\n\n- Important variables assigned:\n  - `coal`: int (total coal collected)\n  - `wood`: int (total wood collected)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (total iron plates collected)\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: object (Burner Mining Drill entity)\n  - `wooden_chest`: object (Wooden Chest entity)\n  - `stone_furnace`: object (Stone Furnace entity)"}
