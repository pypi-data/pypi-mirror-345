{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Line at y=0.0\nConsists of four stone furnaces in a row with complete automation:\n- Furnace at x=0.0 (contains 21 coal, 1 iron ore, 28 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=-1.5 y=0.5 for coal input from wooden chest at x=-2.5 y=0.5 (20 coal)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=0.5 y=-1.5 for ore input from wooden chest at x=0.5 y=-2.5 (empty)\n- Furnace at x=2.0 (contains 21 coal, 1 iron ore, 27 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=2.5 y=-1.5 for ore input from wooden chest at x=2.5 y=-2.5 (20 coal)\n  - Has output wooden chest at x=2.5 y=1.5 (empty)\n  - Has output burner inserter at x=1.5 y=1.5 to move plates to the chest\n- Furnace at x=4.0 (contains 23 coal, 1 iron ore, 13 iron plates)\n  - Has output wooden chest at x=4.5 y=1.5 (empty)\n  - Has output burner inserter at x=3.5 y=1.5\n- Furnace at x=6.0 (contains 23 coal, 1 iron ore, 13 iron plates)\n  - Has output wooden chest at x=6.5 y=1.5 (empty)\n  - Has output burner inserter at x=5.5 y=1.5\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Entity placement collision errors\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces, account for the furnace's 2x2 tile size\n- Use appropriate spacing parameter when placing entities next to large structures\n- Check entity dimensions before attempting to place adjacent entities\n- When placing chests near furnaces, ensure there is enough space between existing structures\n- Consider alternative directions when initial placement fails due to entity collisions\n\n### Resource management errors\n- Check inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Keep track of consumed resources to ensure enough materials remain for planned construction\n- Consider crafting or gathering more resources when running low on essential items\n- Verify you have required items in inventory before attempting to place or insert\n- Check recipe requirements before attempting to craft items\n\n### Furnace efficiency\n- Avoid placing furnaces without having resources ready to fuel and supply them\n- Set up furnaces one at a time, ensuring each is properly supplied before moving to the next one\n- When extracting products from furnaces, immediately resupply them with raw materials\n- Monitor furnace warnings like 'no ingredients to smelt' and address them promptly\n\n### Inserter setup errors\n- Ensure there is a valid destination entity for inserters before activating them\n- Verify inserter drop positions align with valid input slots on destination entities\n- Monitor inserter status - \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" indicates output blockage\n- When placing output inserters, ensure proper spacing and direction relative to the target chest\n\n### Automation design\n- When setting up automated input systems, ensure the complete input-output chain is configured\n- Consider setting up output collection systems alongside input automation\n- Test automation with small quantities before scaling up\n- Plan the layout of automation components (inserters, chests) before placement to avoid conflicts"}
