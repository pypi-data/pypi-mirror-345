{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis facility extracts iron ore using the burner mining drill, stores it in the wooden chest, and then transfers it to the stone furnace for smelting into iron plates. The burner inserter facilitates the movement of materials between entities.\n\n### Coal Processing Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis facility extracts coal using the burner mining drill, stores it in the wooden chest, and then transfers it to the stone furnace. The burner inserter aids in moving materials between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to collisions or occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is enough space and no existing entities at the target position before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. Keep track of your inventory levels to prevent such errors."}
