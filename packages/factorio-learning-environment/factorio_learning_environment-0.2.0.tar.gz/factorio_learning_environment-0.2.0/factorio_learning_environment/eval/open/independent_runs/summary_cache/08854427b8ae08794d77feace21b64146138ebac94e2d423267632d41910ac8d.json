{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe connections from Offshore Pump to Boiler and Boiler to Steam Engine\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Additional Copper Plate Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Laboratory at Position (Not Specified)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Systems\n- PipeGroup for fluid system 2279 at position (5.5, -8.5) for water distribution\n- PipeGroup for fluid system 2283 at position (18.5, -3.5) for water distribution\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles distributed across various positions, providing a voltage of 14000\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Working\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to both the offshore pump and the steam engine. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes that may prevent water from reaching the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Entity Status Assertions\n- When using assertions to check entity statuses, ensure that all conditions for the entity to be in the expected status are met. For example, ensure that the boiler has both fuel and water input to be in a working status.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Check the supply chain to ensure that ores are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Lab Not Receiving Power\n- Check the electricity network to ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Verify that all electric poles are correctly placed and connected."}
