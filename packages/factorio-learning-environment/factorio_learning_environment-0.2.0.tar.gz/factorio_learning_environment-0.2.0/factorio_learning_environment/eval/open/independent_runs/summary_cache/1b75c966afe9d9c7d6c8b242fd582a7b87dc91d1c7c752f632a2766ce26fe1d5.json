{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with a fuel inventory of coal (50 units).\n- The furnace has a status of \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" and warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\".\n- The furnace has produced 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Group at Position (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n- Consists of a series of connected pipes forming a fluid system with ID 9787.\n- Pipe positions include: (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n- The pipe group is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Group\n- Consists of electric poles at positions: (x=-4.5, y=22.5), (x=-3.5, y=22.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5), ..., (x=-3.5, y=21.5), (x=-1.5, y=21.5), (x=-0.5, y=21.5).\n- The electricity group has a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure the area is suitable for placing an offshore pump. Verify there is water and enough space for the pump.\n\n### Boiler Placement Errors\n- Confirm the position is suitable for placing a boiler. Check for obstacles or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Steam Engine Placement Errors\n- Verify the position is appropriate for placing a steam engine. Ensure there is no obstruction or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Connection Errors Between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Ensure pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and boiler. Check for any missing or incorrectly placed pipes.\n\n### Electric Pole Connection Issues\n- Verify that electric poles are placed correctly and can be connected. Ensure there are no gaps or misalignments in the pole network.\n\n### Validation Errors for Building Dimensions\n- Ensure that the dimensions provided for building placement are valid integers. Double-check the input values for height and width."}
