{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) fueled by coal and supplied with iron ore. It is actively working and producing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) fueled by wood, mining coal. It has a warning indicating that its output is blocked due to no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) with no current inventory. It is intended for storage purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is a valid and unoccupied tile before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place a Wooden Chest failed due to occupied positions or invalid placement areas.\n\n### Errors when finding buildable areas\n- When placing entities like the Burner Mining Drill, ensure there is enough space and a viable area for placement. Consider using smaller BuildingBoxes or adjusting the placement strategy to find suitable locations.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or transport belt, to accept outputs from entities like the Burner Mining Drill. This will prevent warnings about blocked outputs and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Maintain an adequate supply of necessary resources, such as coal, to avoid interruptions in operations like fueling furnaces or mining drills."}
