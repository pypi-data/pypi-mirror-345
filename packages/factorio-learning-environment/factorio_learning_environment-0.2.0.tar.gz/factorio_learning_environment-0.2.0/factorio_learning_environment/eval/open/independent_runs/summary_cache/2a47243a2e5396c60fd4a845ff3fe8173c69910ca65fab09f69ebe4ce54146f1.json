{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is designed to mine iron ore and convert it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore. It is currently fueled with coal and has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Serves as a storage unit for iron ore and iron plates. It currently contains 17 iron ore and 19 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is fueled with coal and operational.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Converts iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal and currently has 6 iron ore in its source inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Furnace Production\n- Ensure that the furnace has sufficient fuel and iron ore to produce iron plates. Regularly check and refuel the furnace to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly monitor the storage capacity of chests. Empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to prevent the mining drill from stopping due to a full drop position.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Plan coal harvesting activities to avoid running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer materials between entities. Reposition and align inserters as necessary to maintain efficient material flow."}
