{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=19.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. The boiler has been fueled, but the steam engine is not yet connected to the power network or receiving steam.\n*   Offshore Pump at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n*   Pipes connecting the pump to the boiler (PipeGroup starting at x=-8.5, y=-0.5)\n*   Boiler at (x=-5.0, y=2.5) - Fueled with coal and producing steam.\n*   Pipes connecting the boiler to the steam engine (PipeGroup starting at x=-6.5, y=3.5)\n*   Steam Engine (Generator) at (x=0.5, y=6.5) - Not connected to the power network, lacks steam input.\n*   Initial power poles placed near the steam engine (ElectricityGroup id=26791, poles at x=0.5, y=4.5; x=4.5, y=4.5; x=8.5, y=4.5; x=12.5, y=4.5; x=16.5, y=4.5; x=19.5, y=5.5) - Currently unpowered.\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Assembly Area at Position (x=23.5, y=12.5) to (x=26.5, y=19.5)\nThis area contains the components for assembling iron gear wheels from iron plates. The original mining and smelting setup for this area (previously on coal) has been removed. These components are currently unpowered.\n*   Inserter at (x=23.5, y=12.5) - Intended to feed iron plates onto a belt.\n*   Inserter at (x=26.5, y=12.5) - Intended to feed iron plates onto a belt.\n*   BeltGroup connecting input inserters towards the assembler (inputs at x=23.5, y=13.5 and x=26.5"}
