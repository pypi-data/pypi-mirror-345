This furnace is retrieved from the map and is employed to bolster the supply of iron plates required for further production chains.\n\n### Copper Plate Smelting Furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)\nUsed to smelt copper ore (with coal) into copper plates. This structure is also retrieved from the existing map resources and supports the production of copper plates needed for intermediate items.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Errors with get_entities usage  \n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and positional parameters that do not match the API signature. Always verify the documented interface before invocation.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place a Lab have failed because no Lab exists in inventory. Prior to placement, confirm the intended structure is available in your inventory.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting and sub-ingredient shortages  \n\u2003\u2013 Multiple crafting failures occur because key sub-components (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are missing. Ensure that all prerequisite resources and processing capabilities (including functioning smelting or crafting machines) are in place to complete the Lab recipe.\n\n\u2022 Iteration over a None value  \n\u2003\u2013 When filtering retrieved entities (such as labs), check that the returned value is not None before attempting to iterate over it to prevent type errors."}
