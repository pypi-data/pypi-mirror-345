{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line at position(8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position(8.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear input:\n  - Wooden chest at position(7.5, 10.5) containing iron gears\n  - Burner inserter at position(8.5, 10.5)\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter at position(10.5, 13.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position(11.5, 13.5)\n- Transport belt system starting at position(8.5, 11.5)\n\n### Power Generation System around position(-4.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups carrying water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting various positions\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at different locations:\n1. Setup at position(41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at position(41.5, -79.5)\n\n2. Setup at position(-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at position(-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter and stone furnace chain\n   - Output chest at position(-22.5, -58.5)\n\n3. Setup at position(-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest and inserter system\n   - Stone furnace at position(-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at position(-12.5, -50.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- When placing entities next to reference positions, ensure proper spacing and direction\n- Consider the tile dimensions of larger entities like assembling machines when placing nearby entities\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Keep boilers fueled to maintain consistent power supply\n- Ensure proper connection of power poles to maintain electricity network\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- When building production lines, plan the layout considering the space needed for all components\n- Verify input/output positions of inserters match with the intended source/target entities\n- Consider the working area of assembling machines when placing related infrastructure\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep mining drills fueled to maintain continuous operation\n- Ensure proper fuel supply for burner inserters to maintain material flow\n- Monitor input/output chest contents to maintain production flow"}
