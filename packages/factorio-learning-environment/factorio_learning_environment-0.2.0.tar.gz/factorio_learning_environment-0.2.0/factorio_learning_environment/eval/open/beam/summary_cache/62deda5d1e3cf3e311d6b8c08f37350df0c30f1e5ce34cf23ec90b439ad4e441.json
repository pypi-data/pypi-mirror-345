{"content": "I see the pattern now from the execution results. Here's what I've learned:\n\n1. **Inventory Management**:\n   - We already have burner inserters (3) and stone furnaces (3) in inventory\n   - No need to craft more items as we have sufficient quantities\n\n2. **Entity Placement**:\n   - Furnace placement at (-12.0, 22.0) works\n   - Input inserter at (-13.5, 21.5) works\n   - Output inserter at (-9.5, 21.5) works\n\n3. **Fueling Process**:\n   - Furnace fueling works\n   - Input inserter fueling works\n   - Output inserter fueling fails - likely due to positioning\n\n4. **Common Issues**:\n   - Need to be very close to entities when fueling them\n   - Entity positions must be exact\n   - Need to verify entity existence before operations\n\nHere's what I would recommend for future interactions:\n\n1. **Always verify inventory first**\n2. **Use exact coordinates for placement**\n3. **Move very close to entities before fueling**\n4. **Verify entity existence after placement**\n5. **Handle fuel insertion errors gracefully**\n\nFor the specific issue with the output inserter, we should:\n1. Verify its position after placement\n2. Move closer before attempting to fuel\n3. Verify it exists in the game world\n4. Try alternative positions if needed\n\nWould you like me to try a modified approach focusing on these learnings?", "summary_range": "[1-1232]"}
