    description="""The frequency-severity model has been widely adopted to analyze highly right-skewed data 
                    in actuarial science. To make the model more interpretable, we expect a predictor has 
                    the same direction of impact on both the frequency and severity. However, the 
                    compotemporary use of the frequence-severity model typically yields inconsistent signs. 
                    To this end, we propose a novel sign-aligned regularization term to facilitate the sign 
                    consistency between the components in the frequency-severity model to enhance interpretability. 
                    We also demonstrate our design of the penalty leads to an algorithm which is quite efficient 
                    in analyzing large-scale data. """,
