{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions (x=1.5, y=21.5), (x=17.5, y=20.5), and others forming a continuous connection.\n- Pipe-to-ground at position (x=16.5, y=17.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Steam Pipe Group (fluid system 59020) with pipes running from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n- Water Pipe Group (fluid system 59031) with pipes running from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group (id=166367) with poles at positions such as (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), and others, providing power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the connection points for pipes and underground pipes align correctly with the input and output positions of the entities they are intended to connect. Verify that there are no obstructions or misalignments preventing the connection between the boiler output and the steam engine input.\n\n### Repeated Connection Failures\n- If encountering repeated failures when connecting pipes, double-check the positions and ensure that the correct types of pipes (e.g., regular vs. underground) are being used in the appropriate places."}
