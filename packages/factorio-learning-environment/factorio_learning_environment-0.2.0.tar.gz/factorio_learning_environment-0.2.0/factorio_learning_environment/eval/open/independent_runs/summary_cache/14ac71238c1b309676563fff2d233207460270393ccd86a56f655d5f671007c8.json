{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network and a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore collection.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest, with belts at various positions including (-24.5, -69.5), (-23.5, -69.5), and (-22.5, -69.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a transport belt network and a wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest, with belts at various positions including (-14.5, -54.5) and (-15.5, -54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) for transferring iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the furnace to the inserter and chest, with belts at various positions including (-16.5, -63.5) and (-17.5, -63.5).\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring coal between chests.\n\n### Belt Networks\nMultiple belt groups are established for transporting materials:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-24.5, -70.5) to (-26.5, -70.5).\n- Additional belt groups facilitating material transport across various sections of the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Entity Attribute Access\n- Ensure that the entities you are accessing have the correct attributes. For example, a 'Chest' object does not have an 'outputs' attribute. Verify the entity type and its available attributes before accessing them.\n\n### Errors with Connecting Entities\n- When connecting entities using transport belts, ensure that the path length is valid and that the start and end positions are not the same. Adjust the positions or the path to ensure a valid connection."}
