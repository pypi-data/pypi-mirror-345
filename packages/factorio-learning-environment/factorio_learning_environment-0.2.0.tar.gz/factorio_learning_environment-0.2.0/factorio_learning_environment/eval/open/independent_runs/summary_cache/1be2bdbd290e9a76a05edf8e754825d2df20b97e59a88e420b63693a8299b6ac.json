Ensure that the target location contains a resource patch before attempting to harvest. Use `get_resource_patch` to find the correct location of resources.\n- The agent attempted to harvest stone but did not have the correct position of the stone patch. Use `get_resource_patch` to find the correct location of resources.\n\n### Errors when crafting\n- The agent attempted to craft `stone-furnace` without having enough `stone` in its inventory. Ensure that the agent has the required ingredients before attempting to craft an item. Note that `stone` is a raw resource that must be gathered, not crafted.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- `get_resource_patch(resource_type: Resource, position: Position)`:\n  - Failure: `Could not get stone at x=0.0 y=0.0: No resource of type stone at the specified location.` when there is no resource of the specified type at the given location.\n- `harvest_resource(position: Position, quantity: int, radius: int)`:\n  - Failure: `Could not harvest. Nothing within reach to harvest.` when there are no harvestable resources within the specified radius of the given position.\n- `craft_item(item_prototype: Prototype, quantity: int)`:\n  - Failure: `Failed to craft 2x stone-furnace because couldnt craft a required sub-ingredient for stone-furnace - stone - recipe for stone doesnt exist, it is a raw resource that must be gathered first. Required stone amount for stone-furnace - 9` when the agent does not have enough of the required ingredients in its inventory.\n```"}
