{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station (around x=24, y=-15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Wooden chest for coal storage (position x=23.5, y=-16.5)\n\n### Iron Mining Station (around x=-14, y=23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Wooden chest for iron ore storage (position x=-14.5, y=21.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Area (around x=-10, y=20)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-9.0, y=20.0)\n\n### Copper Processing Station (around x=22, y=20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill for copper ore (position x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden chest for copper ore storage (position x=20.5, y=21.5)\n- Stone furnace for smelting (position x=24.0, y=20.0)\n- Burner inserter system:\n  - Source inserter (position x=20.5, y=22.5)\n  - Furnace inserter (position x=22.5, y=20.5)\n  - Output inserter (position x=24.5, y=18.5)\n- Output storage chest (position x=24.5, y=17.5) containing copper plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- Cannot connect belts directly from chests - use inserters to move items from chests onto belts\n- When creating belt paths between inserters, ensure:\n  - The path is clear of obstacles\n  - The connecting points are valid (no diagonal connections)\n  - The belt placement positions are accessible\n\n### Entity placement considerations\n- Check if target positions are clear before placing new entities\n- Ensure entities are properly aligned with their input/output positions\n- Consider the direction of inserters and belts when creating logistics chains"}
