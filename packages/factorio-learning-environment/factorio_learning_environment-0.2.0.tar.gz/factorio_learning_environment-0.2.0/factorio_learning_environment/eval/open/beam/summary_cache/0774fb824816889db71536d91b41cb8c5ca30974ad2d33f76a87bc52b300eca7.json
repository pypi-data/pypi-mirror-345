{"content": "I see the core issue now. We have entities placed far from our current position (0,0), but we can't interact with them because:\n1. We can only place/interact with entities within 10 tiles of our current position\n2. The drill is at (19,-17) and furnace at (21,-17)\n3. We need to move closer to work with these entities\n\nLet's try this approach:\n\n```python\n# First move closer to our existing setup\ntarget_pos = Position(x=19, y=-17)  # Position of our drill\nprint(f\"Moving to position near drill at: {target_pos}\")\n\n# Move in steps of 10 tiles or less\nmove_to(Position(x=10, y=-10))  # First step\nprint(\"Moved to intermediate position\")\n\nmove_to(Position(x=19, y=-17))  # Final position near drill\nprint(\"Reached final position\")\n\n# Now we can work with the nearby entities\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\nprint(f\"Working with drill at: {drill.position}\")\nprint(f\"And furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Place transport belt at drill's drop position\nbelt = place_entity(\n    Prototype.TransportBelt,\n    position=drill.drop_position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed transport belt at: {belt.position}\")\n\n# Check status\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis approach should:\n1. Move us within range of the existing structures\n2. Allow us to place transport belts to connect them\n3. Complete our automation setup\n\nWould you like me to execute this code?", "summary_range": "[1-2560]"}
