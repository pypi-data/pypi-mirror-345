{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler with pipes at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), etc.\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the Boiler to the Steam Engine with pipes at positions such as (-5.5, 16.5), (-4.5, 16.5), etc.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items\n- Ensure the target entity contains the items you wish to extract. Verify the entity's inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors When Crafting Without Required Ingredients\n- Before crafting, ensure all required ingredients are available in your inventory. For example, iron plates are needed for crafting pipes and steam engines.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary entities in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities Without Required Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items, such as pipes, in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like boilers and steam engines.\n\n### Errors Due to Undefined Variables\n- Double-check that all variables are defined before use. For instance, ensure that `steam_engine` and `steam_engine_buildable_area` are properly initialized before referencing them.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- Verify that all operands in calculations are of compatible types. Avoid operations between incompatible types, such as adding an integer to a non-numeric attribute."}
