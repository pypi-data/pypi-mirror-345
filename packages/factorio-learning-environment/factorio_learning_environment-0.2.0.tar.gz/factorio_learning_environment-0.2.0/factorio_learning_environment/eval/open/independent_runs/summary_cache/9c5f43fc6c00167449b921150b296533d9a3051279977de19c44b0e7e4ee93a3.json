{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of 4 stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0)  \n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have coal fuel but currently no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Research Lab Setup\n- Lab at (10.5, 0.5)\n- Contains 2 automation science packs\n- Connected to power network\n- Currently researching automation technology\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around (-2.5, 24.0) area, consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected by pipe networks:\n  - Water input pipes from pump to boiler\n  - Steam output pipes from boiler to engine\n- Small electric poles connecting power to lab\n- System is operational with boiler and steam engine working\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory requirement errors\n- Check if required items are in inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Ensure you have crafted/gathered required items before attempting to craft complex items that need sub-ingredients\n\n### Recipe and crafting errors  \n- Some items like copper plates and iron plates must be smelted in furnaces, cannot be directly crafted\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered from the environment, not crafted\n\n### Building placement errors\n- Ensure proper spacing when placing buildings, account for entity dimensions\n- Check building requirements (like water source for offshore pump) before placement\n\n### Connection errors\n- Have required connection items (like pipes) in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Ensure entities are within connection range\n\n### Programming errors\n- Cannot directly add integers to ModelPrivateAttr objects\n- Need proper type handling when working with entity dimensions"}
