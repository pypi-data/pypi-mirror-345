For example, a wooden chest must be crafted or acquired before placement.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For instance, ensure you have coal before trying to fuel a mining drill.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Make sure all sub-ingredients are available before crafting complex items. For example, ensure you have enough iron plates and iron gear wheels when crafting a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an entity with no valid contents\n- Confirm that the entity contains the items you wish to extract. For instance, check that there is iron ore in the chest before attempting to extract it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. Remove existing entities if necessary to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Errors when attempting to gather non-existent resources\n- Verify the presence of resources at the target location before attempting to gather them. For instance, ensure there is iron ore at the specified position before placing a mining drill.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities without available space\n- Check that the destination entity has space for the items you wish to insert. For example, ensure furnaces have room for more ingredients before inserting additional iron ore.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities with transport belts. For instance, ensure you have enough transport belts before trying to connect a chest to a furnace.\n\n### Errors with insufficient transport belts to connect entities\n- Maintain an adequate supply of transport belts in your inventory to ensure successful connection between entities. Plan your crafting and resource allocation to avoid running out of belts during critical connections."}
