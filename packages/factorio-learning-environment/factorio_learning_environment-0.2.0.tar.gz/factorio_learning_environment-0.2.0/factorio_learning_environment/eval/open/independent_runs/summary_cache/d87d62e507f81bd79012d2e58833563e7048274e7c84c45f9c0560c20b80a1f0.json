{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (4.5, 1.5) which is refueled and positioned to insert items into the furnaces\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting various positions:\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5), direction UP; Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction UP\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5), direction LEFT\n  - Another BeltGroup with inputs and outputs:\n    - Inputs: Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), direction LEFT\n    - Outputs: Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5), direction UP\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as stone furnaces and burner inserters, are consistently refueled to prevent interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors with inserter operations\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items to avoid the status \"waiting for source items.\" Ensure that the source and destination positions are correctly aligned and supplied.\n\n### Errors with production output\n- Regularly check that the output storage, such as chests, is not empty unexpectedly. Ensure that the production line is correctly configured to deliver items to the storage entities.\n\n### General entity status warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"out of fuel\" and \"no ingredients to smelt\" by maintaining a steady supply of necessary resources to the production entities."}
