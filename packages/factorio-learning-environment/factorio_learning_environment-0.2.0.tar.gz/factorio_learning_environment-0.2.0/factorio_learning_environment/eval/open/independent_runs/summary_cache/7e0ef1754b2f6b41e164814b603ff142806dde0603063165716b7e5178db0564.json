{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) supplying iron ore to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing excess iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (53.5, -80.5), (52.5, -78.5), and (54.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (52.5, -79.5), (53.5, -78.5), (55.5, -78.5), and (52.5, -76.5) transferring coal between chests and other entities.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) storing various resources including iron ore, iron plates, and wood.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of items to transfer. Check the connected entities to ensure they are producing or storing items.\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent production bottlenecks. This will ensure continuous operation of connected entities like mining drills and inserters.\n\n### Inserter Warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"inserter waiting for source items\" by ensuring that the source entity is producing or has items available for transfer.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'burner-inserter', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
