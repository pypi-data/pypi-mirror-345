{"content": "Here is the updated report:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone processing setup at position(x=-50.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-50.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-54.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-51.5, y=0.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-51.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### New mining setup at position(x=-46.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-43.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### Production facility at position(x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=23.0, y=20.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=21.5, y=20.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=26.5, y=20.5)\n- Output chest (position x=28.5, y=20.5)\n- Small electric pole network (positions x=24.5,y=18.5 to x=26.5,y=18.5)\n\n### New power plant attempts\n1. Partial setup at x=30.0,y=30.5:\n   - Boiler (position x=30.0, y=30.5) - not connected\n2. Partial setup at x=40.0,y=40.5:\n   - Boiler (position x=40.0, y=40.5) - not connected\n\n### Offshore pumps\n- At x=-20.5,y=-3.5 (not connected)\n- At x=-9.5,y=-0.5 (connected to pipe network)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power plant placement issues (new)\n- Multiple failed steam engine placements due to water/obstructions (x=26.5,y=17.0; x=32.0,y=30.0; x=42.0,y=40.0)\n- Boiler placement failures at water-adjacent locations (x=24.5,y=17.0; x=-20.0,y=-18.0)\n- Solution: Verify terrain before placement, use land-filled areas for power plants\n\n### Fluid connection problems (continued)\n- Failed boiler-to-steam-engine connection due to invalid pipe routing\n- Offshore pump at x=-20.5,y=-3.5 not connected to any system\n- Solution: Plan pipe routes before placement, verify all connection points\n\n### Entity interaction issues (continued)\n- Failed coal insertion into boiler despite available fuel\n- Multiple furnaces reporting no ingredients despite available resources\n- Solution: Verify inserter configurations and item availability\n\n### General recommendations\n1. Complete one power plant before starting new ones\n2. Verify terrain suitability before placement attempts\n3. Focus on connecting existing systems before expansion\n4. Check inserter configurations and item flows\n\nThe agent should prioritize:\n1. Getting one functional power plant operational\n2. Fixing resource flow in existing production lines\n3. Properly connecting offshore pumps to boilers\n4. Verifying terrain before placement attempts"}
