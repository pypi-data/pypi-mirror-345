{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 24.0)\n\n### Boiler at position(-4.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 24.0)\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages between the offshore pump and boiler. Check the surrounding area for any entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when retrieving steam engine\n- Verify that the steam engine is placed at the correct position before attempting to retrieve it. If the entity is not found, check if it exists at the specified coordinates.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
