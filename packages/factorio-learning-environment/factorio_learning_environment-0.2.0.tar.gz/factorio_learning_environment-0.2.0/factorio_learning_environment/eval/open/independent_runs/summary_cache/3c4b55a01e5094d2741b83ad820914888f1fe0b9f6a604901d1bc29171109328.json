{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n- Small electric poles at various positions to distribute electricity\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Inserter transferring copper plates to an assembling machine\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for producing copper cables from copper plates\n- Inserter transferring copper plates into the assembling machine\n- Small electric poles supplying power to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) storing extracted iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=20.0, y=20.0) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=19.5, y=18.5) storing extracted copper ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inserter Operations\n- Ensure inserters have a clear path to both source and destination items. Avoid placing inserters where they cannot access items due to obstructions or lack of source items.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operations\n- Keep track of furnace fuel levels and ensure they are not overfilled to prevent warnings like \"furnace fuel source is full.\"\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n### Errors in Assembling Machine Operations\n- Ensure assembling machines have all required resources to produce items to avoid warnings like \"cannot create copper-cable due to missing resources.\"\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Verify that entities are placed on unoccupied tiles to prevent placement errors."}
