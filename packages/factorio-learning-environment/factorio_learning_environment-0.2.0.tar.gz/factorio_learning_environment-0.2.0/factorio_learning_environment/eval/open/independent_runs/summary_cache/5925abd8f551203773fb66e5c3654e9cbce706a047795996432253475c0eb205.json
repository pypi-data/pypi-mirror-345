{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Smelting Setup at position (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at (-13.0, -50.0) that smelts inserted iron ore into iron plates.\n- Output Burner Inserter at (-14.5, -51.5) with drop position at (-13.5, -51.5).\n- Input Burner Inserter at (-16.5, -49.5) configured with pickup at (-17.5, -49.5) and drop position at (-15.5, -49.5).\n- BeltGroup connections from (-13.5, -51.5) toward (-17.5, -49.5) with:\n  \u2022 An input belt from (-12.5, -52.5) to (-14.5, -52.5).\n  \u2022 An output belt from (-17.5, -51.5) to (-17.5, -49.5) and an additional belt linkage from (-14.5, -51.5) to (-12.5, -51.5).\n- Collection Chest at (-11.5, -49.5) placed to collect iron plates from the furnace.\n- Additional Burner Inserter at (-9.5, -49.5) rotated to transfer iron plates from furnace to the collection chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup with Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at (-15.0, -50.0) (noted with an \"out of fuel\" warning).\n- Sink Wooden Chest at (-15.5, -51.5) collecting mined ore.\n\n### Additional Logistic Chest\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5) serving as auxiliary storage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Crafting Ingredient and Smelting Shortages:\n  \u2022 Consistent failures in crafting iron-gear-wheels and transport belts arise from insufficient iron plates. Ensure adequate iron plate production via proper smelting and timely inventory transfers.\n- Entity Placement Conflicts:\n  \u2022 Repeated errors in placing burner inserters near the furnace occur due to conflicts with existing transport belts. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions to avoid occupied tile conflicts.\n  \u2022 Similar placement issues with wooden chests (collection chest) have been observed. Verify that the target placement position is unoccupied before attempting to place new entities.\n- Transfer and Inventory Pickup Failures:\n  \u2022 Failures to pick up iron plates at designated furnace drop positions indicate transfer mechanism or timing issues. Ensure that the collection chest receives and holds produced items before attempting pickup.\n  \u2022 Assertion errors regarding expected increased iron plate counts suggest verification failures in automated transfer processes; validate successful transfers before proceeding with crafting updates.\n- Belt Connection Failures:\n  \u2022 Errors connecting transport belts due to missing items in inventory highlight the need to check inventory amounts prior to entity linkage attempts.\n- Fuel and Operation Warnings:\n  \u2022 Warnings related to burner mining drill and burner inserter fuel levels require regular refueling to ensure smooth operation."}
