{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Structure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source (chest) and destination (furnace) entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring items.\n\n### Inserter Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt operations.\n\n### Coal Management\n- Monitor coal levels and ensure a steady supply to fuel mining drills and inserters. Consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal to maintain operations.\n\n### Inserter Setup Verification\n- After repositioning or setting up inserters, verify that they are correctly configured to transfer items as intended. This includes checking the alignment and ensuring they are not waiting for source items due to misalignment or lack of fuel."}
