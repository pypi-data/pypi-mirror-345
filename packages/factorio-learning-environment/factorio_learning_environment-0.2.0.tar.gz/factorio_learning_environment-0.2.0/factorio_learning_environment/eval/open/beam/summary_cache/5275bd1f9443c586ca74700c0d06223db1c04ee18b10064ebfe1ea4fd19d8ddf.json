{"content": "Ah, I understand the issue now. We can't craft wooden chests directly because we need wood first, which is a raw resource that must be gathered. Let's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n# First check our current situation\nprint(f\"Starting inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Current entities: {get_entities()}\")\n\n# We need to gather some wood first\n# Find nearest tree\ntree_pos = nearest(Resource.Wood)\nif tree_pos:\n    print(f\"Found tree at {tree_pos}\")\n    move_to(tree_pos)\n    harvest_resource(tree_pos, quantity=5)  # Get some wood\n    print(f\"Inventory after gathering wood: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n    # Now we can craft a wooden chest\n    if inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Wood, 0) >= 2:  # Assuming wooden chest needs 2 wood\n        craft_item(Prototype.WoodenChest)\n        print(f\"Crafted wooden chest\")\n\n        # Place the chest at the mining drill's output\n        drill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\n        move_to(drill.drop_position)\n        chest = place_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, position=drill.drop_position)\n        \n        # Add some coal to keep the drill running\n        move_to(drill.position)\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=10)\n\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Final entities: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nKey learnings from these attempts:\n1. We need to gather raw resources (like wood) before we can craft items that require them\n2. We should check our inventory before attempting to craft or place items\n3. The mining drill needs a chest at its output position to function efficiently\n4. We should verify resource requirements before attempting actions\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to try a different approach or if you have any specific goals in mind.", "summary_range": "[1-106]"}
