{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is responsible for mining iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (x=5.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (x=7.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (x=6.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (x=9.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (x=8.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (x=4.5, y=-58.5) (This chest receives iron ore from the burner mining drill)\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-50.5)\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n  - (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n\nThese furnaces are responsible for smelting iron ore into iron plates. They are fueled by coal and have been observed to process iron ore when available.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of iron ore to prevent them from running out of ingredients. Regularly check and replenish the ore supply.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from stopping due to a full chest.\n\n### Errors Due to No Fuel in Burner Mining Drill\n- Keep the burner mining drill fueled to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary to avoid stoppages.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `furnace_status`: Dict[Tuple[int, int], str] - Tracks the status of each furnace, indicating whether they are working or lack ingredients.\n- `drill_status`: str - Tracks the status of the burner mining drill, indicating whether it is working or lacks fuel."}
