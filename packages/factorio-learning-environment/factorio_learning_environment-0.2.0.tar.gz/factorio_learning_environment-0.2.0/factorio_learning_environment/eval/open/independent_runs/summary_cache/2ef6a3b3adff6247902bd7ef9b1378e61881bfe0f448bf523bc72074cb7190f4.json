{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5)\n- Electric poles (positions 55.5, 51.5 and 55.5, 54.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure there is no obstruction in the target location before placing electric poles. Check for terrain unplaceability (e.g., water) or other entities blocking the placement.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Make sure that there is a nearby entity that can accept coal before attempting to insert it into the steam engine. Verify the proximity of the coal source to the steam engine."}
