{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-16.0, -49.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-18.0, -49.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n  - Fueled with coal and transferring iron plates from the furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-13.5, -46.5)\n  - Stores iron plates transferred by the burner inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Furnace Placement\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing a stone furnace is unoccupied and that you have the furnace in your inventory before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Verify that you have sufficient resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into structures like furnaces. This includes ensuring you have enough iron ore when trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors with Data Validation\n- When using APIs or functions that require specific data types, ensure that the inputs meet the required data type specifications to avoid validation errors. For instance, ensure that dimensions are specified as valid integers when defining building dimensions."}
