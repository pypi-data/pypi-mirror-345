Increase spacing, change direction, or adjust the reference position to avoid conflicts.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Verify that the path between the source and target entities is clear and valid before attempting to connect them with transport belts.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Always check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are out of fuel or chests are full\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to ensure continuous operation.\n- Empty chests at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue extracting resources.\n\n#### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests, furnaces) have the necessary items for inserters to transfer."}
