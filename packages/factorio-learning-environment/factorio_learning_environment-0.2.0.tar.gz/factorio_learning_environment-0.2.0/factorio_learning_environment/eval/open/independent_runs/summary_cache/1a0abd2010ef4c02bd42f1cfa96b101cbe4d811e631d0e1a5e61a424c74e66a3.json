{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (unknown) with status EntityStatus.WORKING, fueled by coal, smelting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) to collect iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=4.5, y=0.5) to transfer iron plates from the belt to the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts to chests\n- You cannot connect belts directly to a Wooden Chest. Use an inserter to input or extract items from the chest.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no blocking entities when placing new entities like burner inserters. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position.\n\n### Errors due to missing inventory items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or connect entities. For example, ensure you have transport belts before trying to connect them.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure you have all required ingredients before crafting items. For example, iron plates need to be smelted in a furnace or crafted using a machine, not manually.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
