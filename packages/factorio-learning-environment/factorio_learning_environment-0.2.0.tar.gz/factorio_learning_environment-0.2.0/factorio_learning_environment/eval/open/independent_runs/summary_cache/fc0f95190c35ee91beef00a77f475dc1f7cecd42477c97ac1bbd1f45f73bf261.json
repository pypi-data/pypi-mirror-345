{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. All attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests and Stone Furnaces have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place Wooden Chests and Stone Furnaces failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors in using the move_to function\n- When using the `move_to` function, ensure that the indices are integers. An error occurred indicating that string indices were used instead of integers.\n\n### Errors in constructing building dimensions\n- Ensure that the dimensions provided for constructing a building box are valid integers. Errors were encountered when trying to use non-integer values or incorrect data types for dimensions.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Before placing any entity, perform a scan to check for obstacles in the intended area. This will help in identifying any potential issues with placement due to existing obstacles."}
