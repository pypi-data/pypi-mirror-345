{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, used to mine iron ore. The drill is connected to a transport belt system.\n\n### Transport Belt System at position (-15.5, -51.5)\nConsists of multiple transport belts, including a belt at position (-15.5, -51.5) that connects the burner mining drill to the stone furnace, and another belt at position (-15.5, -52.5) that extends the existing belt.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (unknown)\nConsists of a wooden chest that was previously placed at position (-15.5, -51.5) to collect iron ore, but its current position is unknown.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required item in your inventory before attempting to place an entity.\n- Check the recipe for the entity to be placed and gather all necessary ingredients before placement.\n\n### Errors when using entities without sufficient fuel or ingredients\n- Make sure to provide sufficient fuel for entities that require it, such as furnaces and burner mining drills.\n- Ensure that entities have the necessary ingredients to function, such as iron ore for smelting in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when entities are waiting for space in destination\n- Place a sink object, such as a chest, near entities that are waiting for space in destination to unblock them and allow them to function properly.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at positions that are too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity, as the maximum distance for placement is limited.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect entity types\n- Ensure that the correct entity type is used when interacting with entities, such as using an Entity or Position object instead of a BeltGroup object.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of incorrect entity types\n- Ensure that the correct entity type is used when inspecting inventory, such as using an Entity or Position object instead of a BeltGroup object.\n\n### Errors when getting entities at incorrect positions\n- Ensure that the correct position is used when getting an entity, and that the entity exists at that position."}
