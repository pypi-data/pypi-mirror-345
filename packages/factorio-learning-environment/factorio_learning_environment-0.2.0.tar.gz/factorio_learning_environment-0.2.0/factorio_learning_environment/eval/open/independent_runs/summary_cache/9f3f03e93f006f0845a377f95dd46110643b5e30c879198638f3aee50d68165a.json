Ensure sufficient stone is harvested before attempting to craft a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors when placing a drill on an occupied tile\n- The agent attempts to place a burner mining drill at a position already occupied by another entity. Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is empty.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into a drill\n- The agent attempts to insert coal into a drill but has no coal in its inventory. Ensure sufficient coal is harvested before attempting to insert it into a drill.\n\n### Errors when placing an entity that is too far\n- The agent attempts to place a wooden chest too far from its current position. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place the entity.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions:\n\n### Variables:\n- None\n"}
