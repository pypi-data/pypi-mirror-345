{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis facility is responsible for processing iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (chest) to the destination (furnace). Repeated checks and repositioning indicate potential misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the burner mining drill and inserter to prevent interruptions in operations. The mining drill ran out of fuel, causing a halt in ore extraction.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can block further mining operations. Ensure that the contents are regularly extracted or processed to maintain workflow.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the correct input materials and has sufficient fuel to operate. Despite refueling, the furnace produced no iron plates, suggesting issues with input delivery or fuel levels."}
