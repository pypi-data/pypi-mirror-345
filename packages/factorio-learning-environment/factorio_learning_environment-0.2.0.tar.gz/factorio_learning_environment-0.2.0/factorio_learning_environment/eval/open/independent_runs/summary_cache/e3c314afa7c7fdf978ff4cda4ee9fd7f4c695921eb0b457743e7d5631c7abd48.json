{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) containing coal (3 units).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) which is currently out of fuel and has a warning indicating that the chest at (41.5, -80.5) is full.\n\n### Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) currently fueled with coal (2 units) but has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting coal from the wooden chest**: \n  - Ensure the wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) has coal available for extraction. The error occurred because there was an attempt to extract coal when it was not present or the chest was full.\n  \n- **Errors when the burner mining drill is out of fuel**: \n  - Regularly check the fuel status of the burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) and ensure it is refueled to continue operation.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace has no ingredients**: \n  - Ensure that the furnace at (-15.0, -50.0) has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Currently, it has no ingredients to process.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `extract_item(Prototype item_type, Position position, quantity)`: This function failed to extract coal from the wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) due to the chest not containing coal.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `extracted_coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron_ore`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n"}
