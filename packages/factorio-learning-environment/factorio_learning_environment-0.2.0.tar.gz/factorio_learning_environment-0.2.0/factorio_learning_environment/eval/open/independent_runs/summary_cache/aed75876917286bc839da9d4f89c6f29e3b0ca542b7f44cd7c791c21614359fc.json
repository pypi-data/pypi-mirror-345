{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole, currently not receiving electricity, intended to transfer items from the stone furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not conducting any research.\n\n### Electricity Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) providing water, connected to a pipe at position (-9.5, 23.5).\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with coal as fuel, not connected to the fluid system.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5), not connected to the power network or fluid system.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 23.5) with fluid system 918, containing water.\n- PipeGroup at position (1.5, 23.5) with fluid system 921, currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles distributed across various positions, currently not providing power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler to establish a continuous fluid system. Verify that the fluid systems of the offshore pump and boiler match.\n\n### Errors in Power Connection\n- Verify that all components requiring electricity, such as inserters, are connected to a powered electric pole network. Ensure that the steam engine is connected to the power network to generate electricity.\n\n### Errors in Resource Supply\n- Check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt and are supplied with sufficient fuel to operate efficiently."}
