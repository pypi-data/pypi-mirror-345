{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected via transport belts to the furnaces, currently waiting for space in the destination.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) to move items from transport belts to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Collection Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with iron ore input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring items to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Central Furnace Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple belt groups connecting various facilities, ensuring the transport of resources between mining drills, furnaces, and storage chests. The belt network includes:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-24.5, -70.5) to (-26.5, -70.5) and other segments facilitating resource flow.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when Modifying Layout Due to Distance\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing is 10 units. Ensure you are within this range to avoid placement errors."}
