Regularly empty the chests to avoid halting mining operations.\n\n### Errors When Refueling\n- Always check the inventory for sufficient fuel before attempting to refuel mining drills or other entities. Harvest additional coal if necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to source items. Check the pickup and drop positions and ensure they are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities."}
