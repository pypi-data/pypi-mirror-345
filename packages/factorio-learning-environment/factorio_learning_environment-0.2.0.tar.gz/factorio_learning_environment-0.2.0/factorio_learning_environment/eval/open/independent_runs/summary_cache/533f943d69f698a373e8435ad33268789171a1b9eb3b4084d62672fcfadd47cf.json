{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Fuel Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check and reposition if necessary.\n- Keep the inserter fueled to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and refuel as needed.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the setup of the inserter to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Adjust inserter alignment if the furnace is not receiving ore.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent overflow and ensure the mining drill can continue depositing iron ore.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Keep track of the fuel status of the inserter and refuel it with coal to prevent stoppages in the transfer process.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has a steady supply of iron ore to smelt. Check the inserter setup and chest contents to maintain a consistent flow of materials."}
