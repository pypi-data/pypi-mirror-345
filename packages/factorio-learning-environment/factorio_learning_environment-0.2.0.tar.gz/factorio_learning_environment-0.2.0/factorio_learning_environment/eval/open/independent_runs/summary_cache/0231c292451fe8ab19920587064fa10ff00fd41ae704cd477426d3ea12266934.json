{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 24-31)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5) with water output\n- Boiler (position -5.0, 2.5) currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine (position 0.5, 6.5) not connected to power network\n- Pipe network (system 1904) connecting water systems\n- Small electric pole (position 0.5, 8.5) not properly connected\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position 15.5, 70.5) facing right\n- Wooden chest (position 17.5, 70.5) currently full (blocking output)\n- Small electric pole (position 17.5, 71.5) providing power\n- Note: Currently non-functional due to chest blockage and power issues\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt connection errors\n- Repeated attempts to connect belts directly to chests (steps 20, 24, 27, 31)\n- Solution: Always use inserters between chests and belts - belts cannot connect directly to chests\n\n### Entity positioning conflicts\n- Multiple placement attempts where target positions were already occupied (steps 29, 30)\n- Solution: Verify target positions are clear before placement using get_entity() checks\n\n### Mining operation issues\n- Drill output blocked by full chest (position 17.5,70.5)\n- Power connection problems to mining drill\n- Solution: \n  - Regularly empty output chests\n  - Verify power pole connections and coverage\n  - Check drill orientation matches output position\n\n### Boiler operation problems\n- Boiler at (-5.0,2.5) shows \"out of fuel\" warning\n- Solution: Implement automated fuel replenishment system or regular manual refueling\n\n### General recommendations\n- Verify entity connections after placement (power, belts, pipes)\n- Check entity statuses after placement operations\n- Implement error handling for common failure cases\n- Plan entity placements considering required spacing and connections\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(source: Entity, target: Entity) -> BeltGroup`\n  - Attempts to connect two entities with transport belts\n  - Failure modes: \n    - When connecting directly to chests\n    - When target position is occupied\n    - When source/target entities don't exist\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drill: ElectricMiningDrill` - Reference to mining drill entity\n- `chest: WoodenChest` - Reference to output chest\n- `boiler: Boiler` - Reference to boiler entity"}
