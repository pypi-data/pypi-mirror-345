Verify the chest's inventory status to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has the required items available for the inserter to function. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Verify that your inventory contains the items you intend to insert into another entity. Ensure sufficient quantities are available before attempting to insert.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for space in the destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter. Regularly clear or manage the destination inventory to prevent blockages."}
