Avoid using string indices for position values.\n- **Invalid Type for BuildingBox**: When creating a BuildingBox, ensure the width and height are valid numerical types. Avoid using non-numeric types like 'ModelPrivateAttr'.\n\n### Errors with Placement\n- **Cannot Place Entities**: Ensure there is sufficient space and the correct conditions are met before attempting to place entities like Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests. Verify that the target position is valid and unoccupied.\n- **No Viable Spot for Drill**: If a suitable spot for placing a drill cannot be found, consider adjusting the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller boxes to accommodate placement constraints.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Inventory Management**: Regularly check the inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for construction and placement.\n- **Map Updates**: Continuously update and verify the map to ensure that the entities are being placed correctly and that the map reflects the current state after each action."}
