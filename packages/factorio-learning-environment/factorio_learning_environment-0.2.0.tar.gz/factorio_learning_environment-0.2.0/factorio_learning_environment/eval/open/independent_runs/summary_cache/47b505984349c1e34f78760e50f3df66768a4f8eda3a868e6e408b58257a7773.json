{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to facilitate water and steam flow\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to other entities for power distribution\n\n### Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab working on Automation research\n- Connected to the electricity network via small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are required for crafting copper cables and small electric poles, respectively.\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes and Electric Poles\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like steam engines and labs with pipes or electric poles.\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are positioned correctly and within the connection range.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Double-check the positions and existence of entities like labs before performing operations on them. Ensure that the entity type is correctly defined and available on the map.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Entity Status\n- Regularly check the status of entities like steam engines to ensure they are working as expected. If an entity is not working, verify its connections and resource inputs.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Ensure all variables and constants are defined before use. Double-check for typos or undefined variables, especially when dealing with crafting calculations or entity checks.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of your inventory levels for critical resources like coal to ensure continuous operation of structures like boilers and steam engines."}
