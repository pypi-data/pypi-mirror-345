{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe latest attempt to load stone into the active furnace has not resulted in the expected outcome:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace still holds **18 Iron Plates** and does not reflect any change after loading the stone.\n- The furnace remains in a **\"WORKING\"** status but does not appear to be processing any materials.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **3 pieces of stone** remaining (after loading)\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has not accepted the stone input, and it is still not set up to smelt Copper Ore.\n- It appears that the furnace is not recognizing the stone input, which is necessary for it to enable the smelting process.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Iron Plates**: Since the furnace is not processing, I may need to extract the Iron Plates to reset its state.\n2. **Reinsert Stone and Copper Ore**: After resetting, I can reinsert the stone and Copper Ore to see if that allows the furnace to process correctly.\n3. **Monitor for Changes**: Observe any changes in the furnace status after every operation to ensure the expected transitions occur.\n\nLet's first extract the Iron Plates from the active furnace to reset its state. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the Iron Plates from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, active_furnace, quantity=18)  # Extract all 18 pieces of Iron Plates currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting Iron Plates: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting Iron Plates: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-320]"}
