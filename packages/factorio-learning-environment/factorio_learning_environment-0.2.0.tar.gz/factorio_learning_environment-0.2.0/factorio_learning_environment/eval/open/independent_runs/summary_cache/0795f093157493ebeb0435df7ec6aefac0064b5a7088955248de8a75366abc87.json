{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Connected via PipeGroup (position x=21.5 y=-10.5) with fluid steam\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (24.5, -7.5), (24.5, -6.5), and (22.5, -4.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) with a recipe for copper cable\n- Inserter at Position (7.5, 5.5) connected to the power grid\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (10.5, -1.5), (12.5, 1.5), (12.5, 0.5), (10.5, 2.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (8.5, 5.5) containing copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnaces at Positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 2.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) out of fuel\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) containing iron ore\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- PipeGroup (position x=18.5 y=-3.5) with fluid water\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Ingredient Shortage\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for the assembling machine and furnaces to function. The assembling machine at position (10.5, 0.5) is missing copper plates.\n\n### Errors Due to Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. The inserter at position (7.5, 5.5) is waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors Due to Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill at position (-11.0, 20.0) is refueled to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), and (5.0, 5.0) have no ingredients to smelt."}
