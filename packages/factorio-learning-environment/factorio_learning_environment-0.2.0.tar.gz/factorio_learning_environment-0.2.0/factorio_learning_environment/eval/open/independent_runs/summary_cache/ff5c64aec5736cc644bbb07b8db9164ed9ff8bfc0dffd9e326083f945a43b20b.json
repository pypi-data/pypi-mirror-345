{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) fueled with coal, extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the chest to the transport belt.\n- Transport Belt from position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) to (x=43.5, y=-83.5) moving coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing additional coal.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extending transport belts\n- Ensure the path is valid and clear before attempting to extend transport belts. Verify that there are no obstacles or incorrect connections that could prevent the belt from being placed.\n\n### Errors due to lack of smelting ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to start the smelting process. Regularly check and supply the required resources to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors when inserters are blocked\n- Clear the transport belt at the drop position of inserters to ensure smooth operation. Blocked belts can prevent inserters from transferring items, halting production.\n\n### AssertionError in smelting process\n- Verify that the smelting process has started by ensuring that all necessary conditions are met, such as having enough fuel and ingredients in the furnace."}
