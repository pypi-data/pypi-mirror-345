{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Setup Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the inserter's setup to confirm it is functioning as intended.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters and Drills\n- Regularly refuel inserters and mining drills with coal to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels to prevent interruptions in resource processing.\n\n### Inventory Management for Resource Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required resources are available in your inventory to avoid errors related to missing items.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the path from the chest to the furnace is clear and that the inserter is operational to ensure that the furnace receives the necessary ingredients for smelting."}
