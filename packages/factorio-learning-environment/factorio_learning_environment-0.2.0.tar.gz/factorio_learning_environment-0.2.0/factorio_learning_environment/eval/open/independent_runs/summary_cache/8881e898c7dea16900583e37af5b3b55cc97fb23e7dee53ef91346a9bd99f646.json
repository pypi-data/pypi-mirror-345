{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory of coal and producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from a wooden chest to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) serving as a storage for iron ore.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting resources and supplying them to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory of coal and producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring items from a wooden chest to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-7.5, -47.5) serving as a storage for iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. This can be done by checking the current inventory level and comparing it with the maximum capacity.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Make sure that the source entity has sufficient items for the inserter to transfer. Regularly check and restock the source inventory to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are continuously supplied with the necessary ingredients to maintain production. Monitor the input inventory and restock as needed to avoid production halts."}
