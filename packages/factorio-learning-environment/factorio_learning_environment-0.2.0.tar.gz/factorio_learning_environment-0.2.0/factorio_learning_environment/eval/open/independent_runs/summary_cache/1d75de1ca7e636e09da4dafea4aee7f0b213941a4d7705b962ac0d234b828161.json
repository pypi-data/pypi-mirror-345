{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (around x=1-3, y=1-3)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\n- Two wooden chests at positions (1.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 3.5) storing iron plates\n- Two burner inserters at positions (1.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 2.5) moving plates from furnaces to chests\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (around x=2-4, y=7-9)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (2.0, 7.0) and (4.0, 7.0)\n- Two wooden chests at positions (2.5, 9.5) and (4.5, 9.5) storing copper plates\n- Two burner inserters at positions (2.5, 8.5) and (4.5, 8.5) moving plates from furnaces to chests\n\n### Additional Storage/Production Area\n- Burner inserter at position (5.5, 2.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (5.5, 3.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-5 to 13, y=26-35)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (2.5, 35.5) providing water\n- Boiler at (7.0, 35.5) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine at (13.5, 35.5) generating electricity\n- Two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes connecting offshore pump to boiler\n  - Steam pipes connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple electric poles\n\n### Disconnected Structure\n- Unused offshore pump at (-5.5, 26.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Water System Connection Issues\n- Ensure offshore pumps are properly connected to the pipe network\n- The offshore pump at (-5.5, 26.5) has no fluid connections and needs to be integrated into a system or removed\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Some furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Ensure regular supply of raw materials to keep furnaces operational\n- Monitor fuel levels in furnaces to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Entity Placement Best Practices\n- Keep related production entities close together for efficient operation\n- Ensure proper connection of fluid-carrying entities (pumps, pipes, boilers)\n- Plan the layout to minimize distance between related components"}
