{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting various components, including positions (-4.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Small Electric Poles network connecting various positions, including (-8.5, 16.5), (-6.5, 16.5), (-8.5, 17.5), (-8.5, 18.5), (-8.5, 19.5), (-8.5, 20.5), (-8.5, 21.5), (-8.5, 22.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-0.5, 22.5), and (3.5, 23.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Currently has no ingredients and is not operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Electricity Network\n- Ensure all components of the electricity network are properly connected. The steam engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) is not connected to the electric network, which may prevent power distribution.\n\n### Errors with Fuel and Ingredients\n- Make sure to maintain a sufficient supply of coal for the boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) to ensure continuous operation.\n- Ensure that the stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) has the necessary ingredients to function.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Keep track of inventory levels to avoid attempting to place or connect items that are not available, such as small electric poles.\n\n### Errors with Crafting\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is a required raw material for crafting small electric poles and must be gathered beforehand."}
