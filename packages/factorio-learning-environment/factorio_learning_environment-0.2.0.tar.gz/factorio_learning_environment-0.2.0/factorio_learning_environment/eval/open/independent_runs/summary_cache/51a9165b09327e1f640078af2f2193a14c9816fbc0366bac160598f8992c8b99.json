{"content": "I'll create a comprehensive report based on the execution logs provided.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at position(41.0, -85.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill facing DOWN\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -83.5) facing RIGHT\n- Wooden chest at (43.5, -83.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting System 1 at (-20.0, -52.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill facing RIGHT\n- Input burner inserter at (-17.5, -52.5) facing RIGHT\n- Stone furnace at (-16.0, -52.0)\n- Output burner inserter at (-14.5, -51.5) facing RIGHT\n- Output wooden chest at (-13.5, -51.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting System 2 at (-14.0, -54.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill facing RIGHT\n- Input burner inserter at (-11.5, -54.5) facing RIGHT\n- Stone furnace at (-10.0, -54.0)\n- Output burner inserter at (-8.5, -53.5) facing RIGHT\n- Output wooden chest at (-7.5, -53.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting System 3 at (-6.0, -56.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill facing RIGHT\n- Input burner inserter at (-3.5, -56.5) facing RIGHT\n- Stone furnace at (-2.0, -56.0)\n- Output burner inserter at (-0.5, -55.5) facing RIGHT\n- Output wooden chest at (0.5, -55.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n- When placing entities, ensure the target location is clear of existing objects\n- When crafting items that require raw resources (like wood for wooden chests), gather the raw resources first as they cannot be crafted\n- When placing entities in a production line, verify the spacing between components to ensure proper material flow\n- Check if there's sufficient inventory of required items before attempting placement operations\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails if location is occupied or required item not in inventory.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- drill_status: EntityStatus (WORKING, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION)\n- inserter_status: EntityStatus (WORKING, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION)\n- furnace_status: EntityStatus (WORKING, NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- position: Position(x, y) - Coordinates for entity placement\n- direction: Direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) - Entity orientation\n- inventory: Inventory({'item': count}) - Contains item counts"}
