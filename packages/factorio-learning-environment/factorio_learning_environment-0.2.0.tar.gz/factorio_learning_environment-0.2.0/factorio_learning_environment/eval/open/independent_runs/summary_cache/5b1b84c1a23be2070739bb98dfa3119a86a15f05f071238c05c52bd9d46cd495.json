{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Connected Pipe Network spanning multiple positions, e.g., (-48.5, -121.5) to (-57.5, -114.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, e.g., (-61.5, -110.5), (-57.5, -111.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) fueled with coal and producing iron plates\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) fueled with coal and producing copper plates\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) fueled with coal\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) intended to transfer items from the furnace to the chest but not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science packs but no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items or insert them into entities. For example, the error \"Not enough materials to craft Automation Science Packs\" indicates a lack of required materials.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items\n- Verify that the target entity is present and can accept the item before attempting to insert. The error \"Could not find a nearby entity that can accept copper-plate\" suggests that the intended recipient is either missing or incompatible.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers and mining drills to prevent interruptions. The boiler and burner mining drill are out of fuel, which halts their operations.\n\n### Errors Due to Electrical Connection Issues\n- Ensure that all electrical components, such as inserters, are connected to a power network. The inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) is not receiving electricity, which prevents it from functioning.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage\n- Regularly empty storage entities like chests to prevent overflow. The burner mining drill's chest is full, stopping further mining operations.\n\nBy addressing these errors, you can enhance the efficiency and productivity of your operations in the game."}
