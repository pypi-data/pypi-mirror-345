{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore, currently containing 768 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is fueled with coal and currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. If placement fails, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest and the drop position aligns with the furnace. Misalignment will prevent the transfer of items.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to ensure continuous operation. Lack of fuel will halt the transfer process.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify the setup of inserters and ensure that the furnace is correctly aligned to receive ingredients from the inserter."}
