Previous attempts involved fluid_system IDs [22812, 22855, 22898, 22941, 22984, 23027, 23070, 23113] and [23156, 23199, 23242, 23285, 23328, 23371, 23414, 23457]. Recent steps attempted [23500, 23543, 23586, 23629, 23672, 23715, 23758, 23801] with no working PipeGroup found. Ensure that the active PipeGroup is consistently referenced across the steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump.\n\n\u2022 Fixed Delay Stabilization Limitations:\n  - Relying on a fixed 10-second delay for pipeline stabilization does not guarantee that the network is ready. Integrate dynamic readiness checks before reattempting connection operations."}
