{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Smelting System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or unsuitable tiles\n- Ensure there is enough space for the entity and that the tile is not occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Always check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary resources before attempting to insert items into machines or entities.\n\n### Errors in inserter alignment and functionality\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure that the inserter's drop and pickup positions are correctly set to facilitate the intended transfer of resources."}
