{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -66.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items to the chest.\n\n### Belt Groups\n- Belt Group 1: Connects from (x=-25.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-23.5, y=-65.5), direction RIGHT.\n- Belt Group 2: Connects from (x=-24.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-64.5), direction RIGHT.\n- Belt Group 3: Connects from (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-56.5), direction UP, and continues from (x=-17.5, y=-57.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-59.5), direction UP.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that all entities involved in belt connections are properly initialized and not None. Check for correct attributes like 'tile_dimensions' before attempting to connect belts."}
