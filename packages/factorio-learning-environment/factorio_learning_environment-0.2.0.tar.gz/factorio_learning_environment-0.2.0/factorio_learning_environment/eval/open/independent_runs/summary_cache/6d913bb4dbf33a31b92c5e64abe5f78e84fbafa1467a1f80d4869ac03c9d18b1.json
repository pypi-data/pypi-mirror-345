{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Location**: Position (41.0, y=-82.0)\n- **Entities**:\n  - Burner Mining Drill at Position (41.0, y=-82.0)\n  - Stone Furnace at Position (43.0, y=-82.0)\n  - Iron Chests at Positions (41.5, y=-80.5), (42.5, y=-80.5), (44.5, y=-80.5), (45.5, y=-80.5), (47.5, y=-80.5), (49.5, y=-80.5)\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (41.5, y=-79.5)\n  - Burner Inserters at Positions (43.5, y=-80.5), (41.5, y=-78.5)\n- **Use-Case**: This facility is used for mining coal and storing it in various chests. The burner inserters are used to transfer coal between chests and the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\n- **Location**: Position (-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Entities**:\n  - Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Stone Furnaces at Positions (-13.0, y=-48.0), (-11.0, y=-48.0), (-9.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Iron Chests at Positions (-18.5, y=-48.5), (-16.5, y=-48.5), (-15.5, y=-48.5), (-13.5, y=-49.5), (-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Wooden Chests at Positions (-14.5, y=-48.5), (-12.5, y=-49.5), (-9.5, y=-49.5)\n  - Burner Inserters at Positions (-11.5, y=-49.5), (-10.5, y=-49.5), (-8.5, y=-49.5), (-7.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Use-Case**: This facility is used for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. The furnaces are fueled by coal, and the iron plates are stored in chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution\n- **Entities**:\n  - Wooden Chests at Positions (-11.5, y=-45.5), (-10.5, y=-45.5)\n  - Burner Inserters at Positions (-12.5, y=-44.5), (-10.5, y=-44.5), (-8.5, y=-44.5)\n- **Use-Case**: This setup is used for storing and distributing iron plates. The burner inserters are responsible for moving iron plates between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Items\n- **Issue**: Inserters at positions (-12.5, y=-44.5), (-10.5, y=-44.5), and (-8.5, y=-44.5) are consistently waiting for items.\n- **Tip**: Ensure that the upstream supply of items is consistent and sufficient to keep the inserters operational.\n\n### Full Chests Blocking Operations\n- **Issue**: Chests at drop positions are full, preventing mining drills from continuing operations.\n- **Tip**: Regularly clear out full chests to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n### Furnace Output Blockage\n- **Issue**: Furnaces are experiencing blocked outputs due to full inventories.\n- **Tip**: Ensure that there is sufficient space in the destination inventory for furnace outputs to prevent blockages.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- **Issue**: Some furnaces have warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Tip**: Ensure a steady supply of raw materials to the furnaces to maintain continuous production."}
