{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) storing iron plates and iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -52.5), (-2.5, -52.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), and (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron plates and iron ore.\n- Iron Chests at positions (-3.5, -52.5) and (-6.5, -50.5) storing iron plates and iron ore.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel. Currently, these furnaces have no ingredients to smelt and are holding iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Due to Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills are supplied with sufficient fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage Chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty storage chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full chests.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that stone furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials to continue smelting operations.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or important variables have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
