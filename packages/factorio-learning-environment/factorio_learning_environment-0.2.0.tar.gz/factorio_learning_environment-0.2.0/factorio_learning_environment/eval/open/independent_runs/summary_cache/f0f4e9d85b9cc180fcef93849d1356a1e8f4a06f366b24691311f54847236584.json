{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position(x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position(x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input for smelting iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position(x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position(x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input for smelting iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position(x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position(x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input for smelting iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at position(x=4.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position(x=4.0, y=-60.0) fueled by coal, mining iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position(x=4.5, y=-58.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions ranging from (x=5.5, y=-60.5) to (x=9.5, y=-60.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage Chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), and (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions ranging from (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Ensure that the storage chests at the drop position of mining drills are not full to continue mining operations. Regularly empty or upgrade the storage capacity to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients (iron ore) to maintain production. Regularly check and refill the input inventory to avoid production halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore: int` - Represents the amount of iron ore available in inventory and storage.\n- `iron_plate: int` - Represents the amount of iron plates available in inventory and storage.\n- `coal: int` - Represents the amount of coal available for fueling furnaces and mining drills.\n- `wood: int` - Represents the amount of wood available in inventory."}
