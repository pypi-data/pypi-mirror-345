{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron and Copper Processing Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0) to (12.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Processing Line:**\n  - Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) supplied with iron ore.\n  - Burner inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from furnace to chest at position (2.5, 0.5).\n  - Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) storing processed iron plates.\n  - Burner inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) moving items from chest to transport belt.\n  - Transport belt from position (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) moving items along the line.\n  - Burner inserter at position (6.5, 0.5) moving items from transport belt to chest at position (7.5, 0.5).\n  - Chest at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n  - Burner inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring items from chest to furnace at position (10.0, 0.0).\n  - Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) supplied with copper ore.\n  - Burner inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) transferring items from furnace to chest at position (12.5, 0.5).\n  - Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Transport belt connecting mining drill to chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that the source and destination entities for inserters are correctly positioned and available. For example, the inserter at position (6.5, 0.5) is waiting for source items because the expected wooden chest at position (5.5, 0.5) is not found.\n\n### Errors with Chest Operations\n- Verify that the chests are not full and have the correct items for extraction. The agent encountered issues extracting items from chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (41.5, -83.5), and (42.5, -83.5).\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Blockages\n- Regularly check and clear blockages on transport belts to ensure smooth item flow. The agent faced blockages at positions (4.5, 0.5) and (9.5, 0.5).\n\n### Errors with Resource Supply\n- Ensure that the furnaces and inserters are adequately supplied with the necessary resources, such as coal for fuel and ores for processing. The agent encountered issues with supplying inserters and furnaces due to missing resources.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended entity. The agent faced issues when attempting to place entities on occupied tiles."}
