{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map as per the execution logs. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving to positions\n- Ensure that the pathfinding system can calculate a valid path to the desired position. Errors like \"Could not get path from x=199.5 y=199.5 to x=400.5 y=400.0\" indicate that the path is not feasible. Verify that the target position is within the map's navigable area.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Before attempting to place an entity, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at x=400.0 y=400.0\" suggest that the tile may be obstructed or invalid for the entity type.\n- Ensure that the placement coordinates are within the bounds of the buildable area. Attempting to place entities outside of these bounds will result in placement failures.\n\n### Errors related to string indices\n- When handling data structures, ensure that indices are used correctly. Errors like \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" suggest that there might be an incorrect handling of data types. Verify that the correct data types are being used for operations involving indices."}
