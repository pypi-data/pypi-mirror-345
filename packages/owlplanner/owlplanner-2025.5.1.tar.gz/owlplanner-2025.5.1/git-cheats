# Restore older version as HEAD
git checkout <thursday good commit hash>
git checkout -b fix-branch
git cherry-pick <another good commit hash>

(repeat cherry pick for each commit you want)
Now you have a branch with just the commits you want. You can merge it back into master like this:

git merge --strategy=ours master
git checkout master
git merge fix-branch
