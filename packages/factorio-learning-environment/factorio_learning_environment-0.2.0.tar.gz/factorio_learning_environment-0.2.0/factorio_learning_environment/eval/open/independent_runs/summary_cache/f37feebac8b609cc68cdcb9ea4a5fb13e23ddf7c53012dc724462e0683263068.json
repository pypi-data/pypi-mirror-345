{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (not specified, but connected to the offshore pump)\n- Steam engine at position (not specified, but connected to the boiler)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a furnace at position (0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a furnace at position (5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (not specified) and inserter that puts into assembling machine (position not specified)\n- Beltgroup (position not specified) that connects the furnace at position (not specified) to assembling machine at position (not specified)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electricity connections\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the electric network. Check for obstructions that may prevent connections.\n\n### Errors when using undefined entities\n- Make sure that all entities are properly defined before use. If an entity is not recognized, check for typos or ensure that the necessary modules or libraries are imported correctly.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions or placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes. Check the surrounding area for other entities that may interfere with the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Verify that the target tile is free from obstructions."}
