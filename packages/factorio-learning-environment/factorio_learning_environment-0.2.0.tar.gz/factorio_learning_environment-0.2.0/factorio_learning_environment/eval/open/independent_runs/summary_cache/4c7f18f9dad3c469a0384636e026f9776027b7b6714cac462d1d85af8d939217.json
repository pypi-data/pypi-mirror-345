{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently has a warning for \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) with warnings for \"out of fuel\" and \"output blocked by item on the ground\". It extracts copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates. Currently has warnings for \"out of fuel\" and \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\".\n\n### Errors due to output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or a clear path for the output of a mining drill to prevent the warning \"output blocked by item on the ground\".\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like furnaces and mining drills to avoid warnings such as \"out of fuel\".\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used for inserting items into entities. Ensure the item is available in inventory before calling this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `stone_furnace`: Represents the stone furnace entity used for smelting ores.\n- `burner_mining_drill`: Represents the mining drill entity used for extracting ores."}
