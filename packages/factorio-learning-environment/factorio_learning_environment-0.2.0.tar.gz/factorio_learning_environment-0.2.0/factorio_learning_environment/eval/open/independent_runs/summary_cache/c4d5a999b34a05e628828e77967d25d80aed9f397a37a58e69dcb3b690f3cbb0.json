{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 21.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) with status `EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT`\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status `EntityStatus.WORKING`\n- Pipe-group at position (-12.5, 21.5) with status `EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT`\n- Electricity-group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715) with status `EntityStatus.NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK`\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone-furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with status `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Obstructed Positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities like steam engines, boilers, offshore pumps, and electric poles is clear of obstructions before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Electric Poles\n- Verify that electric poles are placed correctly and are within range to connect to each other to establish a functional electric network.\n\n### Errors in Using the `pickup_entity` API\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that if the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be `None`. Conversely, if the second argument is a Position object, ensure the first argument is not an Entity object.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel and Ingredients\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel or ingredients, such as boilers and stone furnaces, are provided with the necessary resources to function properly."}
