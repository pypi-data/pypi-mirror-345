{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer Station at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is frequently repositioned and refueled to ensure proper alignment and operation.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues with the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the chest and furnace respectively. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning properly, as seen with the repeated repositioning of the inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5).\n\n### Errors when Refueling Inserters\n- Verify that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel inserters. An error occurred when trying to insert coal into an inserter without having coal available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Placement\n- Avoid placing an inserter in a position already occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts, as encountered when attempting to place a burner-inserter next to an occupied position.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly configured to transfer items to the furnace. The furnace is not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or configuration issues with the inserter."}
