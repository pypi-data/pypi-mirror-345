Use `False` for boolean values\n### Could not get Prototype.BurnerInserter at position\n- The agent tried to get an entity at a position where it does not exist. Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n### Failed to craft item because couldnt craft a required sub-ingredient\n- The agent attempted to craft an item (iron-gear-wheel) without having the necessary ingredients (iron-plate). Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item.\n### Could not extract\n- The agent attempted to extract an item from an entity, but the extraction failed. This could be due to various reasons, such as the entity not containing the item, the agent not being close enough to the entity, or the entity's inventory being full. Ensure the entity contains the item, the agent is close enough, and there is space in the agent's inventory before attempting to extract.\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant variables:\n- Prototype.IronPlate: type = Prototype\n- Prototype.BurnerInserter: type = Prototype\n```"}
