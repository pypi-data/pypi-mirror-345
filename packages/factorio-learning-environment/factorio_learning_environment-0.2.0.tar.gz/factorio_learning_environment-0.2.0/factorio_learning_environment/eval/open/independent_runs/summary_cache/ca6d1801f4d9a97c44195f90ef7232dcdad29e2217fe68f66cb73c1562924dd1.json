{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) which is currently working. It has a fuel inventory of 4 units of coal, a source inventory of iron ore, and produces iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) which is out of fuel and has its output blocked by an item on the ground. It is connected to:\n  - Transport Belt at position (43.5, -82.5) moving in the RIGHT direction.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) which is waiting for source items and has a full chest warning. It is connected to:\n    - Transport Belt at position (43.5, -80.5) moving in the DOWN direction.\n    - Transport Belt at position (43.5, -81.5) moving in the UP direction.\n- BeltGroup connecting various belts, with inputs and outputs defined, but currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Wooden Chests\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing a wooden chest is not obstructed by other entities or terrain features before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when Extending Transport Belts\n- Verify that the path for extending transport belts is clear and that there is sufficient space for the extension.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel and Output Blockages\n- Regularly check the fuel status of mining drills and ensure that their outputs are not blocked by items on the ground. Implement sink entities to accept outputs from drills.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to pick up and drop items and that connected chests or containers have available space to prevent blockages."}
