# list your desired tasks here, use the name specified during task creation to reference it
# you may add "tags" to tasks e.g. "task_alias_one+subset?0_05+confuse?0_1" shrinks the task to 5 percent of
# training samples and afterward replaces 10 percent of the labels by random assignments

# Available tags are:
# identity -> does not change task, not necessary to be added for individual tasks, only necessary for tagging.variants
# nested -> nests the task, shifting validation split to test data and re-distributing the remaining splits into train+val
# (these tags are more for internal use, it is straightforward to implement additional tags, see the "mml-tags" plugin)

# Note: keywords are separated with a '+' and following args are separated by a '?'. Any task name may never
# incorporate a ' '. A tagged task thus generally looks like task_alias+tag1?value1?value2+tag2+tag3?value1fortag3...

task_list:
  - 'abc'
  - '123'
  - 'foo'

# a pivot task is one of the tasks provided above (or False for no task) and has a special role in some schedules
# the pivot task may be modified via keywords directly, this will automatically replace one non-modified version in
# the tasklist above
pivot:
  name: False
  tags: '+confuse?0_1'

# convenience methods for tagging all tasks at once (all) or/and create variants (variants) so multiple differently
# tagged versions of each task, use '+identity' to keep an unmodified variant
tagging:
  all: '+subset?0_05+confuse?0_1'
  variants:
    - '+identity'
    - '+subset?0_05'
    - '+confuse?0_1'
