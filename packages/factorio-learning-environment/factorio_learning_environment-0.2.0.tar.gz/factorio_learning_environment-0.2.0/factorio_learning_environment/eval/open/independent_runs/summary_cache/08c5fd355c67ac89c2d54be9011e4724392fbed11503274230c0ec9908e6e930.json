{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\n- **Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, -49.5):** Contains iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest at Position (-10.5, -49.5):** Receives iron ore and coal from other chests.\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\n- **Wooden Chest at Position (54.5, -78.5):** Contains coal.\n- **Wooden Chest at Position (-10.5, -49.5):** Receives coal from the chest at (54.5, -78.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production\n- **Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0):** Produces iron plates from iron ore. Currently has an inventory of 98 iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. The stone furnace at position (-14, -49) is full, causing repeated failures when trying to insert coal.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron ore in the chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n  - `coal_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal in the chest at (54.5, -78.5).\n  - `target_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of the target chest at (-10.5, -49.5).\n  - `stone_furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron plates in the stone furnace at (-14.0, -49.0)."}
