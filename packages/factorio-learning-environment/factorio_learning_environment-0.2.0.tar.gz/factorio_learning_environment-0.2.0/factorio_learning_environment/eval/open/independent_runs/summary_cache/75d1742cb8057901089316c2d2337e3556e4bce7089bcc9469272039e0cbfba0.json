{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0) and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5) connected via pipes. The steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5) is not connected to the boiler due to distance issues.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### Lab at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a lab (position 5.0, 5.0) that is currently not powered.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the distance between the offshore pump and the steam engine is within the maximum pipe connection distance. If the distance exceeds the limit, consider adding intermediate pipes or repositioning the entities.\n  \n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the intended position.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
