Monitor the first furnace as it continues to process its remaining iron ore.\n2. Once both furnaces have finished processing, we should gather more iron ore to maintain production.\n3. With our accumulated iron plates, we can plan for crafting additional entities to expand our factory operations.\n\nLet's continue to wait for the first furnace to finish processing its remaining iron ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the first furnace to finish processing\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration as needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-78]"}
