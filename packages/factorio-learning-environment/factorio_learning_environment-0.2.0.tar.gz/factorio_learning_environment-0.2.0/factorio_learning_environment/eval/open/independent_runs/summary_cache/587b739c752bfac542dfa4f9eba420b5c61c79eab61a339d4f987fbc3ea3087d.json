There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (39998 units)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure the target position is free before placing entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts. Clear any obstructing items or entities first.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables in scripts\n- Verify that all variables are defined before use. In the script, 'ore_furnace' was not defined, resulting in a NameError. Ensure variable names are correctly referenced and initialized.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
