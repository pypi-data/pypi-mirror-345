{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(x=10.5, y=10.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position x=10.5, y=10.5), boiler(position x=-6.0, y=24.5), and offshore pump(position x=-9.5, y=24.5) connected by pipe groups.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=43.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill(position x=43.0, y=-84.0) and a furnace at position(x=40.0, y=-82.0)\n- Burner mining drill(position x=-15.0, y=-50.0) and a furnace at position(x=40.0, y=-82.0) are not directly connected, but are part of the same mining operation\n- Multiple furnaces at positions(x=45.0, y=-83.0), (x=42.0, y=-81.0), (x=45.0, y=-80.0), and (x=40.0, y=-79.0) with corresponding wooden chests\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill(position x=43.0, y=-84.0) and a furnace at position(x=40.0, y=-82.0)\n- Assembling machine is not present in the provided logs, but inserter(position x=3.5, y=0.5) and wooden chest(position x=2.5, y=0.5) are part of the factory\n- Belt group is not explicitly mentioned, but pipe groups connect the offshore pump to the boiler\n\n### Lab at position(x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of a lab with input {'automation-science-pack': 67} and two burners inserter(position x=3.5, y=0.5) and (position x=0.5, y=3.5) with corresponding wooden chests\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target position is empty before placing an entity\n- Move closer to the target position if it is too far away to place the entity\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Need more than one waypoint to connect entities\n\n### Errors when using furnaces\n- Furnaces need ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure the furnace has fuel to operate\n\n### Errors when using boilers\n- Boilers need to be connected to a fluid system\n- Ensure the boiler has fuel to operate\n\n### Errors when using inserter\n- Inserter needs source items to operate\n- Ensure the inserter has fuel to operate\n\n### Errors when using offshore pump\n- Offshore pump needs to be connected to a pipe group\n- Ensure the offshore pump is working correctly\n\n### Errors when using steam engine\n- Steam engine needs input liquid to operate\n- Ensure the steam engine is connected to a pipe group"}
