This error occurred when attempting to pick up entities using a non-callable object.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. This can be due to empty inventories or incorrect configurations."}
