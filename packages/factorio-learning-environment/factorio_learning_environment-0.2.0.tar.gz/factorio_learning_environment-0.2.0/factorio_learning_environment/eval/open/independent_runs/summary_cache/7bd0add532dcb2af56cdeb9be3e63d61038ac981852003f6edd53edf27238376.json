{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with fuel inventory containing 9 coal, working status, and drop position at (41.5, -80.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with fuel inventory containing 1 coal, working status, and furnace source inventory containing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory containing 9 coal, working status, and drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) with normal status and empty inventory.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with no fuel, status indicating no fuel and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) with normal status and empty inventory.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Sufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of furnaces and mining drills to ensure continuous operation. The copper furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) ran out of fuel, causing it to stop working.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure the source inventory has the required items before invoking this function to avoid errors.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity, which requires careful management of its fuel and input resources.\n  - `coal` (int): Represents the quantity of coal available in the inventory, crucial for fueling mining drills and furnaces.\n  - `iron_ore` (int): Represents the quantity of iron ore in the inventory, used as input for the iron furnace."}
