{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) used for storing iron plates and other materials.\n- Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5) for transferring items between the furnace and the chest.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups connecting various positions:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (45.5, -82.5) to (48.5, -79.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (43.5, -80.5) to (63.5, -50.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (42.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -46.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (44.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -54.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (49.5, -80.5) to (60.5, -69.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (49.5, -78.5) to (58.5, -69.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (50.5, -79.5) to (59.5, -70.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (59.5, -68.5) to (67.5, -54.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that chests have enough space before attempting to store items. Consider using larger storage solutions or distributing items across multiple chests to prevent inventory overflow.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Wood is a raw resource and must be gathered before crafting wooden chests. Ensure you have the necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items.\n\n### Extraction and Supply Errors\n- Ensure that there are available resources in your inventory before attempting to supply furnaces or extract items. Maintain a steady supply of necessary resources like iron ore to keep production facilities operational.\n\n### Output Blockage Errors\n- Regularly clear output blockages in production facilities to maintain efficiency. Ensure that there is a clear path for output items to be stored or transported.\n\n### Harvesting Errors\n- Ensure that your inventory has enough space before attempting to harvest resources. Consider clearing out unnecessary items or expanding your inventory capacity.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'stone-furnace', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
