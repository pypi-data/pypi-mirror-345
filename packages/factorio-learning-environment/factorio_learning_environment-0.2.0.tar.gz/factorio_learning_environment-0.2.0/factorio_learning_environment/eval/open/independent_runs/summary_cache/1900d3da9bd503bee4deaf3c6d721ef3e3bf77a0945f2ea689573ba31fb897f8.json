{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron and Copper Smelting Facility at Positions (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0)\n\nThese furnaces are used for smelting iron ore and copper ore into iron plates and copper plates, respectively. Coal is used as fuel for these furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### TypeError in Inventory Check\n- Ensure that all inventory checks return an integer value. The error indicates that the inventory check for iron plates returned a `NoneType`. Use `current_inventory.get(item, 0)` to avoid this issue.\n\n### AssertionError for Iron Gear Wheels\n- Verify that the required number of iron gear wheels is available in the inventory before attempting to craft items that require them. This error suggests insufficient iron gear wheels for crafting a lab.\n\n### Crafting Errors due to Missing Sub-Ingredients\n- Copper cables cannot be crafted directly from copper plates without a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace. Ensure that copper plates are smelted in a furnace and that a crafting machine is available for crafting copper cables.\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients for crafting complex items like labs and electronic circuits are available and processed correctly.\n\n### Repeated Crafting Errors for Copper Cables\n- Multiple attempts to craft copper cables failed due to the lack of copper plates. Ensure copper plates are available by smelting copper ore in the furnaces and that the furnaces are adequately fueled."}
