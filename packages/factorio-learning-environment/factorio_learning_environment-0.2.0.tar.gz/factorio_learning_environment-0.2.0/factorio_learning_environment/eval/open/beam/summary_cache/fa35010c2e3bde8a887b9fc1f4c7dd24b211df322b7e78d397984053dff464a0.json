{"content": "Ah, now I see the core issue - we don't have a stone furnace in our inventory to place! Let's check if we can craft one first.\n\n```python\n# First check our current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Check the recipe for stone furnace\nprint(\"Checking stone furnace recipe...\")\nrecipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nprint(f\"Stone furnace recipe: {recipe}\")\n\n# Try to craft a stone furnace\ntry:\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\n    print(\"Successfully crafted stone furnace\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to craft stone furnace: {e}\")\n\n# Check our updated inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# If we now have a furnace, continue with placement\nif 'stone-furnace' in inventory:\n    # Get reference to our drill\n    drill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\n    print(f\"Found drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n    # Place furnace next to drill\n    furnace_pos = Position(x=drill.position.x + 2, y=drill.position.y)\n    move_to(furnace_pos)\n    furnace = place_entity(\n        Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n        position=furnace_pos\n    )\n    print(f\"Placed furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n```\n\nThis will help us understand:\n1. What we currently have in our inventory\n2. What we need to craft a stone furnace\n3. Whether we can craft one with our current materials\n\nThen we can proceed with the smelting setup once we have the furnace.", "summary_range": "[1-2858]"}
