{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Ore Mining and Transportation:\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n  - Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n- Iron Smelting:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) feeding iron ore from a transport belt into the furnace.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing produced iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing extracted copper ore.\n- Transport Belt network facilitating the movement of copper ore.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Wooden Chests at various positions (e.g., (1.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5)) storing various resources like coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Multiple Belt Groups facilitating the movement of resources across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### NameError: Undefined Entity Reference\n- Ensure that all entity classes are correctly imported and defined before usage. For instance, replace undefined references like 'Chest' with the correct class or import statement.\n\n### AttributeError: Missing Attributes in Entity Objects\n- Verify that the entity objects have the necessary attributes before accessing them. For example, check that 'prototype_name' is a valid attribute for the entity in question.\n\n### General Debugging Tips\n- Regularly review and update the code to match the current API specifications and entity definitions.\n- Implement error handling to gracefully manage unexpected attribute or name errors, potentially logging these for further analysis."}
