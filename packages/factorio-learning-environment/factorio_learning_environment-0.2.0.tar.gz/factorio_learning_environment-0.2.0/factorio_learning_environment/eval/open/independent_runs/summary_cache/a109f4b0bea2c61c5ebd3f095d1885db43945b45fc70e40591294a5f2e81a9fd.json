{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace but is currently misaligned.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Errors\n- Ensure the inserter's pickup position is aligned with the chest and its drop position is aligned with the furnace. Repeated misalignment is causing the furnace to not receive iron ore.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the burner mining drill and burner inserter to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Always ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines or entities, as seen with the failed attempt to insert coal when none was available.\n\n### Low Coal Supply\n- Monitor coal levels and consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal to maintain continuous operation of fuel-dependent entities."}
