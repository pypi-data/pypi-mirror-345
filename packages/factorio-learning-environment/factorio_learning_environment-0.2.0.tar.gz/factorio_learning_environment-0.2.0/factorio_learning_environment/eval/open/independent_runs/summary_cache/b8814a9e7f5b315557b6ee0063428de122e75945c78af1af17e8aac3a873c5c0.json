{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (24.5, -7.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting various positions such as (20.5, -10.5), (21.5, -10.5), (22.5, -10.5), (24.5, -10.5), (20.5, -8.5), (20.5, -9.5), (24.5, -9.5), (20.5, -7.5), (20.5, -5.5), (23.5, -4.5), (22.5, -4.5), (24.5, -5.5), (24.5, -4.5), (19.5, -5.5), (18.5, -5.5), (19.5, -2.5), (20.5, -5.5), (22.5, -4.5), (19.5, -2.5), (19.5, -5.5), (18.5, -3.5), (22.5, -3.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) with fuel and copper plate production\n- Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) with fuel and copper plate production\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel and iron plate production\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at Position (unknown) with missing science packs and research in electronics\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) connected to the wooden chest and small electric poles at positions (-2.5, 0.5), (-2.5, 1.5), (-3.5, 2.5), (-2.5, 2.5)\n\n### Additional Offshore Pump\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5) connected to a pipe network at positions (4.5, -9.5) and (5.5, -9.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Specifically, avoid placing a pipe at Position (19.5, -2.5) where an entity already exists.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Connection\n- Ensure all entities that require electricity are connected to a power source. The steam engine and inserter are not receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure all fluid connections are properly established. The steam engine and boiler are not receiving input liquid, indicating a possible issue with the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Supply\n- Ensure that boilers and furnaces have a sufficient fuel supply to operate continuously. The boiler is out of fuel, which prevents it from functioning correctly."}
