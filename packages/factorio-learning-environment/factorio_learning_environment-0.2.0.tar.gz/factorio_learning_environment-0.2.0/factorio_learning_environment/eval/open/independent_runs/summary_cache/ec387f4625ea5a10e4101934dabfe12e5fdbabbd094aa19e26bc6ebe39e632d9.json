Drop unnecessary items or use storage solutions like chests to free up space.  \n\n- **Inefficient item dropping**:  \n  - The agent drops large quantities of items (e.g., coal, iron plates, iron ore) multiple times without resolving the underlying inventory issue.  \n  - **Tip**: Plan inventory usage more effectively. Drop only the minimum required items to free up space for crafting.  \n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions or variables have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
