{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-55\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Steam Power Generation at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=8.5)\nGenerates electricity using steam power. The boiler was refueled multiple times (Step 40, 45, 48, 52) and power is currently active.\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler at (x=-5.0, y=2.5) (Fueled with coal)\n- Steam Engine at (x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting pump to boiler (x=-8.5, y=-0.5) to (x=-5.5, y=0.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine (x=-3.5, y=3.5) to (x=-2.5, y=6.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at (x=0.5, y=8.5) connected to the Steam Engine.\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction and Processing (Attempted Coal Input for Plastic)\nExtracts crude oil, processes it into petroleum gas, and attempts to feed coal into a chemical plant for plastic bar production. Power is active, but the chemical plant lacks coal input due to failed belt automation.\nConsists of:\n- PumpJack at (x=17.5, y=40.5) extracting crude oil.\n- StorageTank at (x=25.5, y=43.5) storing crude oil.\n- OilRefinery at (x=30.5, y=63.5) processing crude oil into petroleum gas. (Status: WORKING in Step 55 log, previously intermittent FLUID\\_INGREDIENT\\_SHORTAGE)\n- StorageTank at (x=40.5, y=66.5) storing petroleum gas.\n- ChemicalPlant at (x=37.5, y=72.5) intended for plastic bar"}
