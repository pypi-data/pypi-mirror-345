{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is used to extract iron ore and is currently working with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), and several others used for storing extracted resources and processed materials. Notably, the chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains 159 iron ore.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates. The chest at (-5.5, -50.5) contains 702 iron ore and 1400 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). These furnaces are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Each furnace is currently working and contains iron ore and iron plates in their respective inventories.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory in Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing extracted resources and processed materials have enough capacity. Regularly check and empty chests to prevent overflow and halt in production.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- The mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full. Ensure that the output chests are regularly emptied to maintain continuous operation of the mining drill.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore_inventory: int` - Represents the amount of iron ore in storage, currently at 183 units.\n  - `iron_plate_inventory: int` - Represents the amount of iron plates in storage, currently at 5757 units.\n  - `coal_inventory: int` - Represents the amount of coal in storage, currently at 340 units."}
