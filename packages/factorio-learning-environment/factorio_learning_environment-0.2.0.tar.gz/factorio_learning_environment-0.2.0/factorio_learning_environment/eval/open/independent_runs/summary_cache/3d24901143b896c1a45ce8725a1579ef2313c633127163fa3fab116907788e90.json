{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-13.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-13.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) for material handling\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (0.5, 16.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5)\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (7.5, 10.5), (15.5, 2.5), (11.5, 6.5), etc.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the target location for pipe placement is clear and not obstructed by other entities. Adjust the position before attempting to place pipes.\n\n### Errors in Underground Pipe Placement\n- Verify that the target location for underground pipes is suitable and not obstructed. Consider alternative positions if placement fails.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connectivity Issues\n- Make sure that boilers and steam engines are properly connected to each other and to the water source. Check for any missing or misaligned connections.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source and receiving electricity. Check the connection to electric poles and ensure they are powered.\n\n### Fluid Connection Issues\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established and that there are no missing pipes or misaligned connections between boilers and steam engines."}
