{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n  - Warning: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: Contains iron ore (6 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, Stone Furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Warning: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure you are within the max distance (10 units) from the target position before placing entities. Move closer to the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with collisions\n- Check for nearby entities that might block placement. Consider increasing spacing, changing the direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors with inserter setup\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between the chest and the furnace. Ensure that the inserter has a clear path and is fueled to function properly.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory in the chest\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at the drop position to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full inventory.\n\n### Errors with insufficient fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of fuel (coal) for all entities that require it, such as inserters and furnaces, to ensure continuous operation."}
