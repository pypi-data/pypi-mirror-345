{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, y=-47.5) for storing processed iron plates\n- Two Burner Inserters at positions (-14.5, y=-46.5) and (-14.5, y=-45.5) for moving items between entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (43.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, y=-80.5) containing coal\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, y=-82.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, y=-80.5) for moving items between entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to missing items.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Check that the source entity has the necessary items for the inserter to transfer. If the source is empty or the inserter is not correctly positioned, it will wait indefinitely.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of storage space.\n\n### Furnaces with no ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Without ingredients, furnaces will not function and will display warnings."}
