{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Initial Iron Smelting Area at (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces used for initial iron plate production:\n- First furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Second furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Automated Iron Mining & Smelting System at (-18.0, -49.0) and (-15.0, -50.0)\nTwo complete mining setups:\n\nFirst Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -49.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-16.5, -47.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-15.5, -47.5)\n\nSecond Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-13.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-12.5, -48.5)\n\n### Copper Mining System at (-28.0, -61.0) and (-28.0, -63.0)\nTwo mining setups with inserters:\n\nFirst Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5, -62.5)\n\nSecond Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -63.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-27.5, -64.5)\n\n### Copper Smelting System at (-27.0, -56.0) and (-27.0, -53.0)\nTwo smelting lines with inserters and output storage:\n\nFirst Line:\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -56.0)\n- Input inserter at (-28.5, -55.5)\n- Output inserter at (-25.5, -55.5)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -55.5)\n\nSecond Line:\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -53.0)\n- Input inserter at (-28.5, -52.5)\n- Output inserter at (-25.5, -52.5)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -52.5)\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nPartial belt network connecting mining to smelting:\n- Belt group from mining area to smelting area with 17 belts\n- Secondary belt group with 3 belts near smelting area\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a location\n- Ensure player is within range (max 10 units) when placing entities\n- When placing entities next to each other, verify spacing and direction parameters\n\n### Transport Belt Issues\n- Ensure you have transport belts in inventory before attempting to place them\n- When connecting entities with belts, verify all intermediate positions are clear\n- Use proper belt group management functions for cleanup and modifications\n\n### Production Chain Blockages\n- Monitor \"waiting for space in destination\" warnings and ensure proper output handling\n- Place appropriate sink objects at drop positions when indicated by warnings\n- Verify entire production chain has proper spacing and connections\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in all burner entities\n- Ensure sufficient coal distribution to all active machines\n- Monitor input/output ratios to prevent backups\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Use correct entity prototypes when querying or manipulating entities\n- Handle entity attributes correctly (e.g., checking for 'belts' attribute existence)\n- Use proper error handling when picking up or placing entities\n\n### Entity Positioning\n- Pay attention to exact coordinates when placing interconnected entities\n- Use entity's drop_position property to determine correct placement\n- Consider entity dimensions when planning layout"}
