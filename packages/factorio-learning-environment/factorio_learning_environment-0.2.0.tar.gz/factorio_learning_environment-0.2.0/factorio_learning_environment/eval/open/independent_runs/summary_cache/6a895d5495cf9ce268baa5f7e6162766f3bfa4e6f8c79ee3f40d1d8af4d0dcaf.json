For example, 'Military' should be checked if it's a valid attribute.\n* Errors when researching a technology that is already researched:\n  - Check if a technology is already researched before attempting to research it again.\n* Errors when placing an entity too far away:\n  - Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n* Errors when an entity is not connected or has no input/output:\n  - Ensure that entities are properly connected and have the necessary inputs and outputs. For example, the steam engine was not connected and had no input liquid.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
