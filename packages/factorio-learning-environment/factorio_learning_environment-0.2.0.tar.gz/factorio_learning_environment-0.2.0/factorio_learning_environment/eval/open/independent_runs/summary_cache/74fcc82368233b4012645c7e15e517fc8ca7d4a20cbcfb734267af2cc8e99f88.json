{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for coal storage\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items between entities\n- Additional Iron Chests at positions (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for extended coal and iron plate storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Iron Chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-13.5, -49.5), and (-14.5, -47.5) for iron ore and plate storage\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have completed processing before attempting to extract items. Check the furnace status to confirm it is ready for extraction.\n\n### Errors when clearing drop chests\n- Verify that the chests contain the expected items before attempting to clear them. Ensure the correct chest is targeted and that it contains the items you intend to extract.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Check the current fuel status of entities before attempting to refuel to avoid unnecessary actions. Confirm that the entity requires additional fuel."}
