{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) fueled by coal and currently smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for ore collection.\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport belts and a burner inserter moving iron ore to a wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) waiting for source items to transfer into the chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Wooden chests at various positions (e.g., (-17.5, -69.5), (-20.5, -63.5), (1.5, 0.5)) storing various resources like copper plates, iron plates, coal, and iron ore.\n- Multiple belt groups facilitating transport of resources across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure that the source chest has the required resources before attempting to extract or insert items. This will prevent errors such as \"No Prototype.CopperPlate available in the source chest.\"\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entities for inserters have the necessary items to transfer. This will avoid the \"inserter waiting for source items\" warning.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. This will prevent the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning and ensure continuous production."}
