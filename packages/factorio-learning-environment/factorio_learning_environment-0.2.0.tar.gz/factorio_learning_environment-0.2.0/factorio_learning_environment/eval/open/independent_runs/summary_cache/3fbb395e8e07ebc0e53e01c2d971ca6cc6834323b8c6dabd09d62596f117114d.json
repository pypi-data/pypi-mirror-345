{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Smelting Setup at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- First furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Second furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal as fuel but currently have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n###Copper Mining Setup at position(-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0)\nCurrently not operational due to lack of fuel.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when trying to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Before attempting to place entities (burner mining drills, furnaces), ensure they are available in the inventory\n- If needed items are not in inventory, craft them first using required materials\n- Check inventory contents before placement attempts\n\n### Errors related to entity fuel status\n- Remember to fuel burner mining drills after placement\n- Add fuel (coal) to burner mining drills before expecting them to operate\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from player position\n- Maximum placement distance is 10 units from player position\n- Move closer to the target location before attempting to place entities\n- Calculate distance between current position and target position before placement\n\n### Errors when placing entities in invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is suitable for the entity being placed\n- Check if the drop position of mining drills is valid for furnace placement\n- Consider the tile dimensions of entities when planning placement positions"}
