{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) refueled with coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) receiving iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) waiting for source items to transfer to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) refueled with coal, mining iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) intended to smelt iron ore but currently lacks ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) waiting for source items to transfer to the furnace.\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5) currently empty.\n- Additional Stone Furnaces at positions (-11.0, -48.0) and (-9.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have items available for transfer. Check the inventory of the source entities to ensure they are not empty.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are used as drop positions for mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Furnaces with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to smelt. Check the supply chain leading to the furnaces to identify any bottlenecks or interruptions.\n\n### Efficient Use of Resources\n- Monitor the fuel levels in mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Refuel them as needed to prevent downtime."}
