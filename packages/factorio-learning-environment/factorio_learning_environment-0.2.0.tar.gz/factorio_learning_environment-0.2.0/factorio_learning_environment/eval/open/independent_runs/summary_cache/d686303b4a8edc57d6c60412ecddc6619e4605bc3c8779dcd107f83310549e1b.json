Regularly check the inventory of the wooden chest and refill as necessary.\n  \n- **Errors when using burner mining drill without fuel:**\n  - Always check the fuel status of the burner mining drill before attempting to use it. Make sure to insert fuel into the drill to avoid it becoming inactive.\n\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for items:**\n  - Ensure that the source entity (like a wooden chest) has sufficient items available for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting for source items, check the inventory of the source.\n\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for space in destination:**\n  - Make sure that the destination entity (like a furnace) has space available for the items being inserted. If the inserter is waiting for space, check the inventory of the destination.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined or invoked.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory: dict` - Inventory of the wooden chest.\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status: str` - Status of the burner mining drill.\n  - `stone_furnace_status: str` - Status of the stone furnace.\n  - `burner_inserter_status: str` - Status of the burner inserters."}
