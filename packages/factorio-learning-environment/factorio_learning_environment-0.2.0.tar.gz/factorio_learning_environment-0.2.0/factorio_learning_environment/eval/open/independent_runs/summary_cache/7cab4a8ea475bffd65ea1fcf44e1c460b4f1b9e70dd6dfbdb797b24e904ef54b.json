{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and connected to:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), currently out of fuel and connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storage.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into mining drills or furnaces. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Regularly check the status of furnaces to ensure they have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Furnaces with warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt\" indicate a need for input materials.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Monitor the fuel levels of mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel. Drills with warnings like \"out of fuel\" need to be refueled promptly to maintain production efficiency.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: This function is used to insert items into entities. It failed when there was insufficient coal in the inventory, indicating a need for inventory checks before execution.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity where coal is inserted.\n- `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity where coal is inserted."}
