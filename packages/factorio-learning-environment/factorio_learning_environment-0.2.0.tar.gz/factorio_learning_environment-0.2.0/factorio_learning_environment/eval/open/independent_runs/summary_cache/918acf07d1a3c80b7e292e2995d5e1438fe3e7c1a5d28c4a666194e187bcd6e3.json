The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully placed. As a result, there are no existing structures to report at this time.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place a Wooden Chest**: The agent attempted to place a wooden chest at various positions (e.g., x=30.0 y=30.0, x=40.5 y=-82.5, x=50.0 y=-90.0, x=0.0 y=0.0, x=100.0 y=-150.0). Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n  \n- **Cannot place a Transport Belt**: The agent attempted to place a transport belt at positions such as x=45.0 y=-85.0 and x=65.0 y=-105.0. Verify that the tile is free and the belt can be placed without obstruction.\n\n- **Cannot place a Stone Furnace**: The agent tried to place a stone furnace at x=5.0 y=5.0. Check that the location is clear and appropriate for a stone furnace.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Check for Occupied Tiles**: Before placing any entity, ensure that the tile is not already occupied by another entity or obstacle.\n- **Verify Placement Conditions**: Some entities have specific placement conditions. Make sure these conditions are met before attempting to place the entity.\n- **Review Inventory and Resources**: Ensure that you have the necessary resources and items in your inventory before attempting to place structures."}
