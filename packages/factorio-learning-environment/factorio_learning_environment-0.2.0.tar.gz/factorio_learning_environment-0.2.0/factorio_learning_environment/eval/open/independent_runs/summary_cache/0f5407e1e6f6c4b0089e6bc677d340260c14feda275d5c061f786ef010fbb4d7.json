{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully built on the map. The agent repeatedly attempted to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for Automation Science Pack research, but all placement and crafting attempts failed due to inventory shortages and sub-ingredient dependencies. No additional structures (such as furnaces or mining setups) were placed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API usage for entity retrieval:\n  - Correct calls to get_entities by removing unsupported keywords (e.g. do not use \u201cradius\u201d) and avoid using extra positional arguments. Verify the API signature before invocation.\n  \n\u2022 Lab placement and inventory checks:\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab at a given position, confirm that the Lab item is available in the inventory.\n  - Prevent iteration over a None value by checking that the result from get_entities (or similar calls) is a valid list\u2014default to an empty list if necessary.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting and resource dependency failures:\n  - Ensure that all required base ingredients and subcomponents (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available before attempting to craft a Lab.\n  - Verify that smelting operations produce sufficient quantities of base materials (e.g. iron and copper plates) to satisfy cascading recipe requirements.\n  - Reassess resource management and the production sequence to resolve missing ingredient issues prior to initiating Lab crafting."}
