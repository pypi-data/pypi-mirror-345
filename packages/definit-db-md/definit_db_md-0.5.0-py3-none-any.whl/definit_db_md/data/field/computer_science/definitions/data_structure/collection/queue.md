# queue

Queue is a [data structure](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/foundamental/data_structure.md) providing first-in-first-out (FIFO) semantics.

Serves as a [collection](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/collection.md) of elements with two main [operations](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/foundamental/operation.md):

- Enqueue, which adda an element to the rear of the queue, and
- Dequeue, which removes an element from the front.

Additionally, a peek [operation](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/foundamental/operation.md) can, without modifying the queue, returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.
