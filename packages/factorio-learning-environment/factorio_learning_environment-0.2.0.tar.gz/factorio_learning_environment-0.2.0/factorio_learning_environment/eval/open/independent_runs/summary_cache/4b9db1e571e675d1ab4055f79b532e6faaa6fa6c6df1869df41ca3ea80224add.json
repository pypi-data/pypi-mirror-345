{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-44.5, -123.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-45.5, -124.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -123.0)\n- Pipe at Position (-46.5, -122.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Furnace Setup\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Unpowered Lab\n- Lab with automation science pack input, status NO_POWER\n\n### Steam Engine Setup\n- Steam Engine at Position (8.5, 36.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups at various positions with status EMPTY\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, voltage 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to a water source. Check the connections between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure there are no gaps or misalignments.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected and that there are no missing segments in the fluid transport system.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Make sure that inserters are within the range of an active power pole and that the power network is operational.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Connect the steam engine to the power network to ensure it can generate electricity. Check for any missing connections or misaligned poles.\n\n### Lab and Other Entities Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional electricity network. Check for disconnected poles or insufficient power generation."}
