{"content": "I see we have several issues to address:\n\n1. The mining drill at (-15.0, 23.0) has a full chest at its output\n2. The mining drill at (-11.0, 25.0) has no fuel\n3. There's a blocked inserter at (-11.5, 27.5)\n\nLet's fix these one by one:\n\n```python\n# First, let's add fuel to the empty mining drill\nmove_to(Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0))\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0), quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to mining drill\")\n\n# Now let's clear the blocked chest by adding another inserter to move items out\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.5, y=21.5))\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=Position(x=-14.5, y=21.5),\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\n\nif inserter:\n    print(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n    # Add fuel to the new inserter\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Add a transport belt to receive items from the inserter\nmove_to(Position(x=-13.5, y=21.5))\nbelt = place_entity(\n    Prototype.TransportBelt,\n    position=Position(x=-13.5, y=21.5),\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n    exact=True\n)\n\nif belt:\n    print(f\"Placed transport belt at {belt.position}\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Current entities: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Add fuel to the empty mining drill\n2. Add an inserter to move items out of the full chest\n3. Connect the inserter to a transport belt to move items away", "summary_range": "[1-624]"}
