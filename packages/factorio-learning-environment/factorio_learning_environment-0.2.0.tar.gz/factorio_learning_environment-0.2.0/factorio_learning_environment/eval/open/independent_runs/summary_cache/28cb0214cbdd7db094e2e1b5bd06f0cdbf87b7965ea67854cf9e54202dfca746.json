{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe group connecting various components, including positions (-5.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Multiple small electric poles connecting the network, including positions (-8.5, 20.5), (-8.5, 19.5), (-8.5, 18.5), (-8.5, 17.5), (-8.5, 16.5), (-6.5, 16.5), (-1.5, 16.5), (0.5, 16.5), and (0.5, 21.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required raw materials and sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, gather wood and copper plates before crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have small electric poles in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Electric Network\n- Make sure all components are properly connected within the electric network to avoid issues with the electricity group not being plugged in.\n\n### Errors in Fueling Boilers\n- Ensure that the boiler has fuel to operate effectively. Insert coal or another fuel source as necessary.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Products from Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace contains the product you wish to extract before attempting extraction."}
