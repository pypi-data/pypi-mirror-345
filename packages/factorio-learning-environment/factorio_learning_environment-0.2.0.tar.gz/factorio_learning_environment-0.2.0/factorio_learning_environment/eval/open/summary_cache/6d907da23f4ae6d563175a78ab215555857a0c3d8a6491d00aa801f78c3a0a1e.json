{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore with intermittent output inventory fullness.\n- Wooden chests at positions (21.5, 75.5), (21.5, 77.5), and (19.5, 75.5) used for staged storage of iron plates; one chest at (19.5, 75.5) was removed and later replaced to clear output blockage.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and storage of iron plates with improved fuel management and partial resolution of output blockage by chest repositioning.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal and operational.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and working, with input inventory containing iron plates and output inventory containing iron gear wheels.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n\nThis structure is actively producing iron gear wheels with sufficient iron plate input and functioning inserters, though output chest remains empty indicating possible extraction issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Output chest extraction errors for assembled items\n- Failed extraction of iron gear wheels from output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) due to chest being empty.\n- Ensure that assembled items are successfully deposited into the output chest by output inserters.\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions and that output chest is accessible and not full.\n- Monitor assembling machine output inventory and output chest inventory to confirm item flow.\n\n### Output blockage and inventory fullness in smelting structure\n- Persistent output blockage warning at electric mining drill (17.5, 72.5) caused by furnace output belt or chest being full.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Removal and replacement of wooden chest at (19.5, 75.5) helped clear blockage temporarily.\n- To prevent blockage, ensure output chests and belts have sufficient capacity and are not full.\n- Consider extending or adding additional storage or belts downstream.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) occasionally report waiting for source items when input chests are empty.\n- Maintain steady supply of input materials in chests to avoid inserter idle states.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous repeated failures placing small electric poles near steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to occupied tiles remain unaddressed.\n- Always verify tile occupancy before placement and adjust placement parameters or positions to avoid conflicts.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps."}
