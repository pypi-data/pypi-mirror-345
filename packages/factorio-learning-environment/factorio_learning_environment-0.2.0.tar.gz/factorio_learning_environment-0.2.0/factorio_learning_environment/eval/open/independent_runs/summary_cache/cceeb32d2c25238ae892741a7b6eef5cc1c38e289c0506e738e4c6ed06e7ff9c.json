{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). It is currently working and has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=4.5, y=-58.5), and several others, some of which are full of iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0). The furnace at (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) has a warning for no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. This will prevent errors like \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors from Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting due to lack of storage space.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item is available in the inventory before calling this function to avoid insertion errors.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_to_insert: int` - Represents the quantity of iron ore intended for insertion into furnaces.\n  - `furnace: Entity` - Represents the furnace entity being interacted with for item insertion."}
