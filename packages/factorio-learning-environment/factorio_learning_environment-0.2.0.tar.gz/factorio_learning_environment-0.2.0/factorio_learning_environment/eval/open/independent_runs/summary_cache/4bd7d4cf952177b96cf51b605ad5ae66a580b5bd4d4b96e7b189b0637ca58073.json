{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working and has a warning due to the chest at the drop position being full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). All are working and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5). Some chests are full of iron plates, indicating a need for better inventory management or expanded storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Inventory Warnings\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting due to full inventory warnings.\n\n### Efficient Resource Management\n- Consider expanding storage capacity or improving logistics to handle the large quantities of iron plates being produced, as several chests are full.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron ore in the inventory.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron plates in the inventory.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal in the inventory.\n\nThe report reflects the current state of the agent's structures and provides guidance on improving efficiency and avoiding errors."}
