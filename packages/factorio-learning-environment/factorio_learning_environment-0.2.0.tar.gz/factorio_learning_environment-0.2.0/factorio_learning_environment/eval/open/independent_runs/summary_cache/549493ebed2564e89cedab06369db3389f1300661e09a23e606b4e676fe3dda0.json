{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nThere are currently no structures on the map. The agent has not successfully placed any entities or created any structures based on the provided execution logs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is buildable before attempting to place an entity. The logs indicate multiple attempts to place entities like Stone Furnaces and Wooden Chests on non-buildable positions such as (x=21.0, y=21.0) and (x=25.0, y=25.0).\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is not occupied by another entity or restricted for building before placing an entity. This includes attempts to place Wooden Chests and Transport Belts at various positions like (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=45.0, y=-85.0).\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that necessary resources are available before attempting to operate or supply entities. Logs indicate issues such as \"No coal available to supply to the single Furnace or Furnace not placed.\"\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Double-check the environment settings and build restrictions to ensure that placement actions are permissible. This includes checking for global build restrictions and ensuring environmental settings are responsive.\n\nThese tips should help mitigate the errors encountered during the execution steps and assist in successful entity placement and structure creation in future steps."}
