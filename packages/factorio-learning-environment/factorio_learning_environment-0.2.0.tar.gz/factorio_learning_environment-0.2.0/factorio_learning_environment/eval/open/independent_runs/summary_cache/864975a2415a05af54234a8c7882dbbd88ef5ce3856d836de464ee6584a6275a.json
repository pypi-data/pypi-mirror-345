{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe at position (-47.5, -122.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (-39.5, -116.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with a fuel inventory of coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with a fuel inventory of coal\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a fuel inventory of coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, status: no power\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-47.5, -122.5) with water, status: full output\n- Several PipeGroups at various positions, all with status: empty\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with multiple small electric poles, voltage: 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Retrieving Non-Existent Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors like \"No entity of type pipe found at the specified position.\"\n\n### Errors Related to Unconnected Structures\n- Verify that all components of your structures are properly connected. For example, ensure that boilers and steam engines are connected to the power network and have input liquids to function correctly.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Check that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a power source. Ensure that the electricity network is functional and providing power to these entities."}
