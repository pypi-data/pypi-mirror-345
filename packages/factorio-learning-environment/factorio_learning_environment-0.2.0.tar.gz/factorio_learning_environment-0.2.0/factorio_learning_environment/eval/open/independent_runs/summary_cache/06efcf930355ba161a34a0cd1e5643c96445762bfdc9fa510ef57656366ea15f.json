{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position: x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Burner inserter (position: x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n- Burner inserter (position: x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n\n#### Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position: x=52.0, y=-79.0)\n- Burner inserter (position: x=53.5, y=-79.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=54.5, y=-79.5)\n- Burner inserter (position: x=55.5, y=-78.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=56.5, y=-78.5)\n\n#### Storage Area at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position: x=0.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=1.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=2.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=3.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=4.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=5.5, y=0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining Drill Not Working\n- Ensure the mining drill has sufficient fuel to operate. Add coal or other fuel sources to the drill's inventory.\n- Check if the output chest is full. Empty the chest at the drop position to allow the drill to continue mining.\n\n#### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Ensure all inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Add coal or other fuel sources to the inserter's inventory.\n\n#### Furnace No Ingredients\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Provide iron ore or other smeltable materials to the furnace.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to the items it needs to pick up. Place the required items in the source chest or adjust the inserter's position.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `drill`: Represents a burner mining drill entity.\n- `drill.status`: Represents the status of the mining drill (e.g., `EntityStatus.WORKING`).\n- `drill.position`: Represents the position of the mining drill (e.g., `x=-15.0, y=-50.0`)."}
