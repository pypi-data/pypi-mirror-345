{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production at (1,1) and (3,1)\nTwo stone furnaces have been placed and are actively smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n- Stone furnace at position (1,1) containing 23 coal as fuel, 1 iron ore as input, and 18 iron plates as output\n- Stone furnace at position (3,1) containing 23 coal as fuel, 1 iron ore as input, and 18 iron plates as output\n\n###Iron Ore Mining at (-15,-54)\nA burner mining drill has been placed to mine iron ore:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15,-54) facing downward\n- Currently not operational due to lack of fuel\n- Mining from an iron ore patch containing 40000 ore\n- Drop-off position at (-14.5,-52.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Error when trying to craft items requiring assembly or smelting\n- Items like iron plates and iron gear wheels cannot be directly crafted in inventory\n- These items require either a furnace (for smelting ore into plates) or an assembling machine (for crafting intermediate products like iron gear wheels)\n- Ensure you have the appropriate production structure (furnace/assembling machine) before attempting to craft these items\n\n### Error when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Check if you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it\n- Craft the required entity first if it's not available in inventory\n\n### Error when inserting fuel into entities\n- Ensure you have the required fuel type (coal) in your inventory before attempting to insert it into machines\n- Collect coal first before trying to fuel burner mining drills or furnaces"}
