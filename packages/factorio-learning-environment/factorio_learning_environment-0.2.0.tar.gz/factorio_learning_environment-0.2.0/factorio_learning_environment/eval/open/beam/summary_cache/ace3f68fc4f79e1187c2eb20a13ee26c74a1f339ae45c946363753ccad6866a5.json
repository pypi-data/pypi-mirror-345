{"content": "Ah, now I see the complete picture! We need:\n1. Stone (which we gathered)\n2. Iron ore (which we don't have yet)\n3.

Make sure the drill is fueled and producing iron ore\n2. Collect the iron ore from the ground\n3. Then proceed with the furnace placement and smelting\n\nThe key insight was that we need to ensure the drill is actually producing iron ore before we can use it in the furnace.", "summary_range": "[1-3440]"}
