{"content": "Ah, I see the core issue now. We can't craft a burner inserter because we need iron-gear-wheels which require a crafting machine. Let's try a different approach using the transport belts we already have in our inventory:\n\n```python\n# Get references to our entities\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Drill position: {drill.position}\")\nprint(f\"Drill drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\n\n# Move to the drill's drop position\nmove_to(drill.drop_position)\nprint(f\"Moved to drop position\")\n\n# Place a transport belt at the drop position\nbelt = place_entity(\n    Prototype.TransportBelt,\n    position=drill.drop_position\n)\nprint(f\"Placed transport belt at {belt.position}\")\n\n# Rotate belt to point towards where we want items to go\nrotate_entity(belt, Direction.DOWN)\nprint(\"Rotated belt\")\n\n# Add fuel to drill if needed\nif drill.status == EntityStatus.NO_FUEL:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n\n# Place chest at end of belt\nchest_position = Position(\n    x=drill.drop_position.x,\n    y=drill.drop_position.y + 1\n)\nmove_to(chest_position)\nprint(f\"Moved to chest position\")\n\nchest = place_entity(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    position=chest_position\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at {chest.position}\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Belt position: {belt.position}\")\nprint(f\"Chest position: {chest.position}\")\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis approach uses transport belts (which we already have) instead of trying to craft inserters. The belt should move items from the drill to the chest. Let's see if this works better.", "summary_range": "[1-2826]"}
