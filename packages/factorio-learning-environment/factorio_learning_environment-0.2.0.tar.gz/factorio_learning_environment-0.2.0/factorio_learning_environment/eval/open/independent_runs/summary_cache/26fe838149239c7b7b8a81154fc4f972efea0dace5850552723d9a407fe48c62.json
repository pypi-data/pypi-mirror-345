Verify the target\u2019s type before initiating a connection.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Errors:\n  \u2013 If placement fails due to the target being too far (e.g., distance exceeding the maximum allowed), move closer to the intended position prior to placement.\n  \u2013 Confirm that the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting placement to avoid missing-item errors.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Errors:\n  \u2013 Ensure all variables (for example, the intended target entity such as \u201ctarget_chest\u201d) are defined and correctly referenced to prevent NameError issues."}
