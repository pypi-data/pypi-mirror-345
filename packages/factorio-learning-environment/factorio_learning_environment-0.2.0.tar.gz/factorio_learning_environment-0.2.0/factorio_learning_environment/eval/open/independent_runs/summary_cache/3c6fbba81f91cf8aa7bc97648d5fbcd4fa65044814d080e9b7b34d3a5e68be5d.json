{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest with an inventory containing 30 coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill which is currently working and has been fueled with coal.\n- Connected to a wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for resource drop-off.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace which currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x1) and a furnace (position y1).\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when extracting from the wooden chest with insufficient inventory**: \n  - Ensure that the wooden chest has enough items before attempting to extract. The inventory was empty after multiple extractions.\n\n- **Errors when the Burner Mining Drill has no fuel**: \n  - Always check the fuel status of the Burner Mining Drill before initiating extraction. The drill was reported as having no fuel multiple times.\n\n- **Errors when the Furnace has no ingredients**: \n  - Make sure to supply the Furnace with the necessary ingredients to operate. The furnace was reported as having no ingredients multiple times.\n\n- **Warnings about the chest at drop position being full**: \n  - Regularly empty the wooden chest to prevent the Burner Mining Drill from stopping due to a full inventory.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined**: \n  - None reported.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: str\n  - `furnace_status`: str\n  - `final_inventory`: dict"}
