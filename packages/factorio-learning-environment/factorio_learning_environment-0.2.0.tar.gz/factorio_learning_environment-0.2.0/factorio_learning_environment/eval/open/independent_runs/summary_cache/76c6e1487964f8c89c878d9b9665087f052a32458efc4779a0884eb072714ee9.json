Always ensure the connection is made to a valid inserter (one that feeds items into the intended entity) rather than directly to a steam engine.\n\u2022 When placing an entity such as a wooden chest, errors due to excessive distance have occurred. Move closer to the intended target position before placing to remain within the maximum placement range.\n\u2022 If an entity placement fails because the item is missing from inventory, verify that the required item is available before attempting the placement.\n\u2022 Variable reference errors (e.g. \u201ctarget_chest is not defined\u201d) indicate that all identifiers must be correctly defined and referenced prior to use."}
