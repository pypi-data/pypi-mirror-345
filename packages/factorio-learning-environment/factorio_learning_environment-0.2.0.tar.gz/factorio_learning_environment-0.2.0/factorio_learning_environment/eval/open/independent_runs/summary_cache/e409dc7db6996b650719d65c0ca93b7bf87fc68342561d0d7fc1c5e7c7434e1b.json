{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo persistent structures have been successfully created on the map. Although multiple attempts were made to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), all efforts failed because the required Lab was not available in the inventory. Other retrieved entities\u2014such as the furnaces used for smelting iron and copper\u2014were utilized in production processes rather than established as constructed, stand\u2010alone structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval:\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, avoid supplying unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \"radius\") or an incorrect number of positional arguments. Always verify the function\u2019s signature.\n\u2022 Iterating over a None value:\n\u2003\u2013 Before iterating over results from get_entities, ensure the returned value is not None.\n\u2022 Lab placement failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required Lab item exists in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n\u2022 Failures in Lab crafting due to unavailable sub-ingredients:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that production chains for intermediate components (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are fully established and that all required resources are available prior to initiating Lab crafting."}
