{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered and working but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with frequent full source inventory warnings.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) serving as storage and input/output buffers for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, feeding chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) and newly placed pole at (17.5, 72.5) connected to power network.\n- Recent attempts to clear blockage by picking up transport belt and burner inserter at (19.5, 75.0) and (20.5, 75.5) respectively, but failed to replace transport belt due to occupied tile.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with improved power connectivity, though output belt blockage at furnace remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (0.5, 6.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), with output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine intermittently receives iron plates directly inserted but frequently reports ingredient shortage preventing crafting.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and inserter setup, but iron plate input remains inconsistent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output belt blockage at furnace output\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage and limiting mining drill throughput.\n- Attempts to clear blockage by picking up transport belt and burner inserter at (19.5, 75.0) and (20.5, 75.5) failed to replace the transport belt due to tile occupancy.\n- To resolve, ensure the output belt path is fully clear and free of entities before placing belts or inserters. Consider rearranging or extending belts to avoid collisions.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Failed placement of small electric pole near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) due to collision with mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) and possible water tiles.\n- Failed placement of transport belt at (19.5, 75.0) due to existing objects blocking placement.\n- To avoid these errors, always check tile occupancy and surroundings before placing entities. Adjust placement parameters such as spacing, direction, or reference position to find valid placement spots.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) remain fueled and operational, preventing stoppages.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to maintain smooth operation.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) frequently reports ingredient shortage due to insufficient iron plates.\n- Direct insertion of iron plates into assembler input occurs but input inventory often empties quickly, and output chest remains empty.\n- Ensure consistent and sufficient iron plate supply to the assembler input chest and maintain clear output paths to enable continuous crafting.\n\n"}
