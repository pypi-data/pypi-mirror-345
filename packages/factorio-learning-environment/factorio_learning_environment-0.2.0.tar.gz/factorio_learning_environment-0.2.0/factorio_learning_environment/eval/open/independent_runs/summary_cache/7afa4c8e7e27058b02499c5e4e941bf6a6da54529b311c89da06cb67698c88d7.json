{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is responsible for mining and transferring iron ore from the mining drill to a chest and then to a furnace for smelting.\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Neighbors: Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Resources: Iron ore (10,000 units available)\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (480 units)\n  - Status: Normal\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Neighbors: Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Status: Working (with warnings: out of fuel)\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Function: Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of iron ore, leading to a lack of smelting in the furnace.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the inserter and mining drill to ensure continuous operation. The inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) frequently runs out of fuel, which disrupts the transfer process.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in your inventory. An error occurred when trying to insert coal into an inserter without having coal in the inventory. Always ensure sufficient resources are available before performing such actions."}
