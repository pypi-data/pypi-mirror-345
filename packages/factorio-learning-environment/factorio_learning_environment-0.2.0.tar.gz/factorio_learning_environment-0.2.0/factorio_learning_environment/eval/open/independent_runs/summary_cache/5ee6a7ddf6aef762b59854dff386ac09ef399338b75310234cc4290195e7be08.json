{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) processing resources.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring resources to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the items you are trying to insert into a structure are present in your inventory. Check inventory levels before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills. This will prevent interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain and inserter operations to maintain a steady flow of resources."}
