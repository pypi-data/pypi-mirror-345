{"content": "The latest attempt to load stone into the active furnace has again produced unexpected results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace currently contains **3 pieces of stone** after the attempted insertion of **5 pieces**. This indicates a persistent issue with the furnace's ability to fully recognize and register all inputs.\n- The furnace is marked as **\"WORKING,\"** but it is not processing any materials, specifically the Copper Ore.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore available.**\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates available.**\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace continues to only recognize **3 pieces of stone** instead of the full **5 pieces.**\n- It remains fueled with **6 pieces of coal** but is unable to process any materials, particularly not smelting the Copper Ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract the Remaining Stone**: I will extract the **3 pieces of stone** currently in the furnace to clear its state.\n2. **Retry Loading the Stone**: After clearing the furnace, I will attempt to load **2 pieces of stone** back into it along with the **1 piece of Copper Ore.**\n3. **Monitor for Smelting Operation**: I'll check if the furnace can now properly process the Copper Ore.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the remaining stone from the active furnace. \n\n```python\n# Extract the remaining stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Extract the 3 pieces of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.\n```", "summary_range": "[1-414]"}
