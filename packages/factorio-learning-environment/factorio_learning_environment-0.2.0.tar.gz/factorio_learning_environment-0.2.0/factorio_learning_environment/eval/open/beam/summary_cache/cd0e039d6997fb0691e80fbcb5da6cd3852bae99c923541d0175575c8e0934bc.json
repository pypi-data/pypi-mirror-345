{"content": "I see the issue now. We need to gather wood first as it's a raw resource that can't be crafted.

Check our current inventory\n2. Look for nearby trees\n3. Move to and mine a tree to get wood\n4. Craft a wooden chest once we have wood\n5. Place the chest at the desired location\n\nLet me know if this works better!", "summary_range": "[1-2720]"}
