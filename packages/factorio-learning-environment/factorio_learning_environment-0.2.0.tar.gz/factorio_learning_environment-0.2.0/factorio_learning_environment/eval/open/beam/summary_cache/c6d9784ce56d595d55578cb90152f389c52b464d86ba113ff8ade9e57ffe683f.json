{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Currently has no ingredients to smelt\n  - Has produced iron plates, with 2 remaining in the furnace\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Operational and mining coal\n  - Drops mined coal at position (40.5, -83.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -83.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Positioned to collect mined coal\n  - Currently has no ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure that all required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace or wooden chest without having them in the inventory resulted in errors.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Process\n- Verify that all necessary raw materials are collected before crafting items. The agent encountered issues when trying to craft a stone furnace without gathering stone first.\n\n### Assertion Errors in Production\n- Monitor production outputs closely to ensure that the required quantities are met. The agent encountered multiple assertion errors due to insufficient iron plates being smelted.\n\n### Errors in Resource Collection\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is correctly positioned to collect resources from the mining drill. An assertion error indicated that the stone furnace was not collecting coal as expected."}
