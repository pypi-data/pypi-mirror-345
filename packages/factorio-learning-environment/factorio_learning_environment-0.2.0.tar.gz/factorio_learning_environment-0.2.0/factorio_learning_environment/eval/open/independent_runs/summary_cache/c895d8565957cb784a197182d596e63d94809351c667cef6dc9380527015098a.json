{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a Transport Belt at position (-25.5, -65.5).\n- Transport Belts at positions (-24.5, -65.5) and (-23.5, -64.5) leading to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) dropping iron ore into a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal and dropping it into a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items from the Wooden Chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when checking for entities at specific positions\n- Ensure that the position you are querying for an entity is correct and that the entity type is present at that position. For example, the error at position x=-21.5 y=-65.5 indicates no transport belt found; verify the position and entity type before querying."}
