  This is the datamodel for Schemasheets Configurations.

  Note that for most purposes you will likely not need to consult this.

  The key class is [ColumnSettings](ColumnSettings)

  Two controlled vocabularies are specified here:

  - [Cardinality](Cardinality) - terms and abbreviations that can be used for cardinality
  - [Shortcuts](Shortcuts) - specifies column configurations

classes:
  ColumnSettings:
    description: |-
      configuration for an individual column in a schema sheet.
      
      These settings are typically specified as YAML blocks beneath
      the relevant column header, for example:

      ```
      > class
      ```
        
    attributes:
      curie_prefix:
        description: >-
          CURIE prefix prepended to column value.
          This may be used for column that describe mapping or class/slot uri properties of the element.
          For example, with column settings `exact_mapping: {curie_prefix: dcterms}`,
          an element row with column value `contributor`, the value will be transformed to `dcterms:contributor`
          
      prefix:
        description: string to be prefixed onto the column value
      suffix:
        description: string to be suffixied onto the column value
      template:
        description: jinja templated format string
      vmap:
        description: |-
          Specifies a mapping for column values
        range: ValueMap
        multivalued: true
        inlined: true
      regular_expression_match:
        range: string
        description: |-
          A regular expression term, the match expression should be in parens
      inner_key:
        range: string
        description: |-
          for complex fields such as annotations that are modeled as dicts, this is used to specify which key in the dict the value should be applied to
      applies_to_class:
        description: |-
          if a value C is specified, then this column in the relevant row is interpreted as
          pertaining to C
        range: ElementReference
      applies_to_slot:
        range: ElementReference
      tag:
        range: string
      internal_separator:
        range: string
        description: |-
          What character should be used to pack multiple values for a single slot (like comments, aliases, etc.)
          Into one spreadsheet cell? Suggested value = |
