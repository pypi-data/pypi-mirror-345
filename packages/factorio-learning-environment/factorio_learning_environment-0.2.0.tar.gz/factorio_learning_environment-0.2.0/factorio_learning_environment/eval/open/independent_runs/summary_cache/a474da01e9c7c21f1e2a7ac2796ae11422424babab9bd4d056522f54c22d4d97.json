{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5) \n- Small electric pole at position (0.5, 1.5)\n\n### Lab at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (3.5, 0.5) which is currently not powered and requires 10 automation science packs to complete research.\n\n### Furnace group at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) which is currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new pole\n- Ensure that the first argument used for placing a new pole is a valid Prototype object. Review the API documentation to confirm the correct usage.\n\n### Errors when lab is not powered\n- Make sure to connect the lab to a power source using electric poles. Check the power grid to ensure that the lab is receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient ingredients for research\n- Ensure that you have the required ingredients, in this case, 10 automation science packs, in your inventory to complete the research. \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
