{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at x=-9.5, y=-0.5\nGenerates electricity using steam power. Currently not operational as the boiler is out of fuel and the steam engine is not connected to the power network.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Offshore Pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 (Status: WORKING)\n*   Boiler at x=-6.0 y=1.5 (Status: Out of Fuel)\n*   Steam Engine at x=1.5 y=3.5 (Status: Not Connected, No Input Liquid)\n*   PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler (x=-8.5, y=-0.5 to x=-6.5, y=-0.5)\n*   PipeGroup connecting Boiler to Steam Engine (x=-4.5, y=1.5 to x=-1.5, y=3.5)\n\n### Stone Mining, Smelting, and Wall Factory near x=-47.5, y=18.5\nMines stone using electric drills, smelts it into stone bricks in electric furnaces, and crafts stone walls in an assembling machine, storing them in a chest. The setup consists of two parallel mining/smelting lines feeding into a single assembler line. The entire setup is currently unpowered.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   **Line 1:**\n    *   Electric Mining Drill at x=-49.5 y=14.5\n    *   Inserter at x=-49.5 y=17.5 (Drill to Furnace)\n    *   Electric Furnace at x=-49.5 y=19.5\n    *   Inserter at x=-47.5 y=19.5 (Furnace 1 to Furnace 2 - intended for belt, currently misplaced logic)\n*   **Line 2:**\n    *   Electric Mining Drill at x=-45.5 y=14.5 (Output blocked)\n    *   Inserter"}
