{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled intermittently, sometimes out of fuel  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled intermittently, sometimes out of fuel  \n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5) moving items between drill, furnace, assembling machine, and chest; these inserters have experienced fuel shortages but have been refueled multiple times  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, still not receiving electricity despite attempts to connect power poles and add power sources  \n- Small electric poles at positions (21.5, 75.5), (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (19.5, 74.5) placed to provide electricity connections; poles connected to assembler but no energized power source present  \n- Attempts made to place steam engine and boiler to provide power, but no offshore pump available in inventory to complete the setup, preventing power generation  \n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and electric poles. The main production line is operational when fueled but halted due to assembler lacking power and inserters running out of fuel intermittently. Power generation infrastructure is incomplete due to missing offshore pump and lack of solar panels.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power  \n- Electric poles are connected but the assembler remains without power because there is no energized power source (steam engine or solar panels) connected to the network.  \n- Attempts to place steam engine and boiler failed to complete power setup due to missing offshore pump in inventory.  \n- To fix: Ensure all components for power generation (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are available in inventory before placement.  \n- Alternatively, acquire solar panels to provide power if steam power setup is not feasible.  \n- Verify power poles form a continuous network connected to an energized power source before expecting assembler to receive power.  \n\n### Errors due to burner inserters and furnaces running out of fuel  \n- Burner inserters and furnaces frequently run out of coal fuel, causing stoppages in item transfer and smelting.  \n- Insertions of coal into burner inserters sometimes fail due to insufficient coal in inventory at the time of insertion.  \n- To mitigate: Maintain a sufficient buffer of coal in inventory before attempting to refuel inserters and furnaces.  \n- Consider automating coal supply or switching to electric inserters once power is available to avoid fuel dependency.  \n\n### Errors inserting coal when inventory is empty or insufficient  \n- Multiple insertion attempts fail because the inventory lacks coal at the moment of insertion.  \n- Always check and ensure coal is present in inventory before attempting to insert fuel.  \n- Harvest coal proactively and maintain a buffer stock to prevent fuel starvation.  \n\n### Errors placing offshore pump without having it in inventory  \n- Attempts to place offshore pump fail because it is not present in inventory, preventing completion of steam power setup.  \n- Before placing complex structures requiring multiple components, verify all required items are in inventory.  \n- Plan resource gathering and crafting to ensure availability of all necessary parts for power infrastructure.  \n\n### Errors crafting steam engine due to missing iron plates  \n- Crafting steam engine fails because required iron plates cannot be crafted automatically (no crafting machine or furnace available for iron plates).  \n- Ensure iron plates are available in inventory or set up automated production of iron plates before attempting to craft steam engines.  \n\n### General placement and connection error tips (from previous report)  \n- Confirm target tiles are free before placing entities to avoid collisions.  \n- Use inserters between furnaces and belts rather than connecting belts directly to furnaces.  \n- Verify assembling machine recipes and power connections before starting production.  \n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
