{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at Position (x=-44.5, y=-124.0) fueled with coal, but not connected to input liquid.\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=-40.5, y=-113.5), not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various positions around the steam engine, but not effectively supplying power.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-15.0, y=-76.0) with an empty fuel inventory, connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-15.5, y=-77.5) containing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-19.0, y=-73.0) fueled with coal, but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) fueled with coal, but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) fueled with coal, but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserter at Position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to move items from the furnace to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=7.5, y=-61.5).\n\n### Pipe Network\nMultiple PipeGroups exist, all currently empty and not effectively connected to supply liquid to the necessary structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that all pipes are properly connected to the intended input and output points. Verify the presence and position of all necessary entities before attempting connections.\n\n### Errors when Using Non-existent Entities\n- Double-check the existence and position of entities before attempting to interact with them. This includes verifying that the offshore pump is correctly placed and accessible.\n\n### Errors with Unpowered Structures\n- Ensure that all structures requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. Verify the connectivity of small electric poles and ensure the electricity generator is operational.\n\n### Errors with Fuel and Ingredients\n- Regularly check that all mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel and ingredients. Ensure that chests are not full and can accept additional resources."}
