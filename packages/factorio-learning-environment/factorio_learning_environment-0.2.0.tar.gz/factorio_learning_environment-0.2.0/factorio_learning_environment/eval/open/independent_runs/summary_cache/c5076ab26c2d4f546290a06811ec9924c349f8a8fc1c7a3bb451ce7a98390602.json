{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 48-55)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (14.5, 8.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (14.5, 8.0) (status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n- Steam engine at (17.5, 8.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Small electric poles at (19.5, 9.5) and (17.5, 11.5)\n- Partial water pipe connection from offshore pumps\n\n### Secondary Boiler at position (14.5, 11.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (14.5, 11.0) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- No steam engine or proper connections\n\n### New Boiler at position (0.5, -2.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (0.5, -2.0) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- No steam engine or proper connections\n\n### Oil Processing Complex\nConsists of:\n- Oil refinery at (15.5, 15.5) (status: NO_POWER, recipe: BasicOilProcessing)\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) (status: NO_POWER)\n- Partial pipe network for crude oil (status: EMPTY)\n- Missing power connections throughout\n\n### Chemical Plant Complex at position (6.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chemical plant (status: NO_POWER, recipe: sulfur)\n- Storage tank at (3.5, 12.5)\n- Small electric poles at (8.5, 10.5), (8.5, 13.5), and (7.5, 14.5)\n- Missing petroleum gas input and power\n\n### Water Pipe Network\nConsists of:\n- Two offshore pumps at (-9.5, -0.5) and (-9.5, -2.5)\n- Extensive pipe network with multiple pipe groups:\n  - Working water pipes (status: FULL_OUTPUT) centered at (-8.5, -2.5)\n  - Empty pipe sections (status: EMPTY) throughout the map\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Issues\n- Repeated placement failures due to occupied tiles (-7.5, -2.5) and (13.5, 20.0)\n- Clear target areas before placement attempts\n- Verify terrain is suitable (not water or cliffs)\n\n### Fluid Connection Problems\n- Persistent offshore pump to boiler connection failures (positions: -9.5/-2.5 to 10.5/20.0)\n- Ensure proper alignment between pump output and boiler input\n- Verify no obstructions in pipe paths\n\n### Entity Retrieval Errors\n- Attempted to access non-existent steam engines\n- Implement existence checks before entity retrieval\n- Maintain inventory of placed entities\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Steam engines remain unconnected despite placement attempts\n- Verify proper spacing (2 tiles between boiler and engine)\n- Ensure all components face correct directions\n\n### Inventory Insertion Failures\n- Failed to insert coal into boilers\n- Verify target entity can accept fuel before insertion\n- Check burner inserter configurations\n\n### Persistent Issues from Previous Report\n- Placement distance problems (still occurring)\n- Fluid system management (still occurring)\n- Power grid connectivity (still occurring)\n\n### New Issues\n- Entity existence assumptions causing index errors\n- Implement defensive programming for entity access\n- Add validation for entity lists before access"}
