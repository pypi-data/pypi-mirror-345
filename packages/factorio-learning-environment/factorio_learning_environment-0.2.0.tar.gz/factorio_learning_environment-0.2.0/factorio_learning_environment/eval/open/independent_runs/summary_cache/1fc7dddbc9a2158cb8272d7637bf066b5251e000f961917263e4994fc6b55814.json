{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (24.0, -15.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest (23.5, -16.5) storing coal with 236 units\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Output chest (20.5, 21.5) storing 159 copper ore\n- Stone furnace (24.0, 20.0) for smelting\n- Input chest (22.5, 21.5) with 397 copper ore\n- Output chest (24.5, 17.5) storing 53 copper plates\n- Burner inserter (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n- Burner inserter (22.5, 20.5) moving items from input chest to furnace\n\n### Iron Processing Line at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-14.0, 23.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest (-14.5, 21.5) storing 103 iron ore\n- Two stone furnaces (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0) for smelting\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Ensure inserters are properly oriented to feed materials into furnaces. Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients\" despite available ore in nearby chests\n- Check that inserter pickup and drop positions align with input chests and furnace input positions\n\n### Resource Flow Optimization\n- Consider optimizing the placement of chests and inserters to minimize transport distance\n- Ensure proper spacing between components to allow for efficient material movement\n\n### Furnace Fuel Management\n- Monitor furnace fuel levels - one furnace showing \"furnace fuel source is full\" warning which may indicate inefficient fuel distribution\n- Consider implementing a more balanced fuel distribution system"}
