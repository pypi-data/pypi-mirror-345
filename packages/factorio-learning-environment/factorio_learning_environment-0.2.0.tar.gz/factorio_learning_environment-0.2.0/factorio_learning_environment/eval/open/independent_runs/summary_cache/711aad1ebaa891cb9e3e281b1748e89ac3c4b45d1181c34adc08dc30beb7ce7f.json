{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities like Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts, but none have been successfully placed due to errors in positioning or buildability checks.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the tile where you intend to place an entity is buildable. Check the terrain and any existing obstructions before attempting to place entities like Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, or Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Verify that the position is unoccupied before placing an entity. Attempting to place an entity where another entity exists or where the terrain does not allow can result in placement failure.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources available to supply to entities like Furnaces. If a Furnace is not placed, it cannot be supplied with resources like coal.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates before placing entities to ensure they are within the buildable area and not overlapping with other entities or terrain features that restrict placement."}
