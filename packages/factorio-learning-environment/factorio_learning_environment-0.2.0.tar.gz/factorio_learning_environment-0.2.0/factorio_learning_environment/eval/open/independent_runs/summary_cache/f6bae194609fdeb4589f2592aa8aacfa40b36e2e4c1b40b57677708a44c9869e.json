{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (1 unit)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Inventory: 30 units of iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Connected to transport belt and burner mining drill\n- **BeltGroup**\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction RIGHT\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction DOWN\n  - Status: Empty\n\n#### Iron Plate Production\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt, furnace result is full\n  - Inventory: 100 units of iron plate\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Connected to transport belt and stone furnace\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting items without available inventory:**\n  - Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates that there was no coal available to insert into the drill.\n\n- **Warnings related to full chests:**\n  - Regularly check and empty chests that are part of your production line to prevent blockages. The warning \"chest at drop position is full\" suggests that the mining operation is halted due to the full chest.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int) -> None`: Inserts specified quantity of an item into the target entity. Ensure the item is available in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory: dict[str, int]`: Tracks the current inventory of items, e.g., `{'wood': 2, 'coal': 5, 'stone': 5, 'iron-ore': 575, 'iron-plate': 922}`.\n  - `entities_on_map: list[Entity]`: Represents the entities currently placed on the map."}
