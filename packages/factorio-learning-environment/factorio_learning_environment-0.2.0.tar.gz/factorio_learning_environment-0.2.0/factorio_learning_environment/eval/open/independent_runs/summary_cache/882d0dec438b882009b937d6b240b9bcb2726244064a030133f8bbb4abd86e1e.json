{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Operation at (-14, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) collecting coal output\n\n###Iron Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) collecting iron ore output\n\n###Copper Processing Line at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) \n- Middle wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5) storing copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) storing copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving ore between input and middle chest\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving processed plates to output chest\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 22.5) attempting to feed furnace\n\n###Unused Furnace Setup\nTwo stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0) without active production\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Furnace Fuel Management Issues\n- Check furnace fuel capacity before attempting to insert more coal. The furnace at (24.0, 20.0) has reached its fuel limit of 50 items\n\n###Inserter Placement and Configuration Issues\n- Ensure inserters have valid pickup and drop locations with appropriate entities at both ends\n- The burner inserter at (22.5, 22.5) has no valid destination entity to drop items into\n- Configure inserter directions properly to establish working material flow between entities\n\n###Production Line Design\n- When setting up production lines, ensure complete end-to-end connectivity between all components\n- Verify that all inserters in the production chain have valid source and destination entities"}
