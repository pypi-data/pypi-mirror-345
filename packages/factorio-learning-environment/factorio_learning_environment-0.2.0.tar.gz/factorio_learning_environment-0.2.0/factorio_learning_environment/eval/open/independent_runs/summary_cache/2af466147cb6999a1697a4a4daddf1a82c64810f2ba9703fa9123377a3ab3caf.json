{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes forming PipeGroup (fluid system 38268 and 38272)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Inserter and Storage System at Position (6.5, -60.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -60.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups for fluid transport, including water and steam systems.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles forming an Electricity Group with various connection points.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Non-existent Entities\n- Ensure that the entity type and position are correct before attempting to interact with it. For example, the error \"Could not get Prototype.Lab at position x=6.5 y=-60.5\" indicates that there was no lab at the specified position. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity exists before calling functions on it.\n\n### Errors Related to Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full capacity. For instance, the warning \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -77.5) to continue mining\" suggests that the mining drill cannot operate efficiently until the chest is emptied.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. The warning \"no ingredients to smelt\" indicates that the furnace is inactive due to a lack of raw materials. Regularly supply furnaces with the required resources to maintain production efficiency."}
