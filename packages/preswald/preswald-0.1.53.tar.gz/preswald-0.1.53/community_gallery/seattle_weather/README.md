# Weather Condition Predictor App

## Dataset Source

The dataset used for this app is from Kaggle, and it contains weather data with the following columns:

- **precipitation**: Amount of precipitation recorded.
- **temp_max**: Maximum temperature recorded during the day.
- **temp_min**: Minimum temperature recorded during the day.
- **wind**: Wind speed recorded.

We use this data to predict the weather condition for each day, which can be one of the following:
- drizzle
- rain
- sun
- snow
- fog

## What the App Does

The app allows users to interact with the dataset and filter weather conditions based on high temperatures. Specifically, the app includes the following feature:

### 1. Filter High Temperatures

Users can filter and view the days where the maximum temperature (`temp_max`) is above a chosen threshold. This is done through an interactive slider that allows the user to adjust the temperature threshold.
