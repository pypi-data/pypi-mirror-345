{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0): Extracts coal and drops it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5): Stores extracted coal.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-47.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-47.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-45.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-16.5, y=-44.5): Transfers items between furnaces and chests.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5): Transfers items between furnaces and chests.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into furnaces without sufficient inventory\n- **Issue**: The agent repeatedly attempts to insert iron ore into furnaces without having enough iron ore in its inventory.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the agent has sufficient iron ore in its inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces. Check inventory levels before insertion commands.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into furnaces after inventory depletion\n- **Issue**: The agent continues to attempt inserting iron ore into furnaces even after its inventory is depleted, leading to repeated errors.\n- **Solution**: Implement a check to verify if the inventory has the required items before attempting insertion. If the inventory is empty, stop the insertion process and refill the inventory first.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into furnaces with no ingredients\n- **Issue**: The furnaces report warnings about having no ingredients to smelt, yet the agent continues to attempt insertion.\n- **Solution**: Monitor the status of furnaces and only insert items when the furnace is ready to accept new ingredients. Avoid inserting items into furnaces that are already full or have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from chests without sufficient items\n- **Issue**: The agent attempts to extract items from chests without ensuring there are enough items available.\n- **Solution**: Check the chest's inventory before attempting to extract items. If the chest is empty or does not have enough items, refill it or adjust the extraction logic accordingly."}
