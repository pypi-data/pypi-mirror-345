{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0), currently working with coal as fuel and iron ore as input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5), responsible for inserting items into the furnace, currently out of fuel and facing issues with blocked drop position.\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace to other entities, facilitating the movement of items.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -53.5), connected to a series of transport belts, currently out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n- Transport Belts from position (-16.5, -54.5) to (-14.5, -54.5), facilitating item movement in the right direction.\n- Additional BeltGroup with inputs and outputs facilitating item movement across different sections.\n\n### Additional Burner Inserter\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -52.5), currently out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Ensure there is a suitable position available before attempting to place a burner inserter. Check for obstructions or occupied tiles.\n\n### Attribute Errors with Position Object\n- When accessing attributes of a position object, ensure the attribute exists. For example, 'pickup_position' should be a valid attribute.\n\n### Errors with Crafting Items\n- Ensure all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For instance, iron plates require a furnace or crafting machine for production.\n\n### Fuel and Input Requirements for Furnaces\n- Regularly check and maintain fuel levels and input materials for furnaces to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Handling Entity Exceptions\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to interact with it to avoid exceptions."}
