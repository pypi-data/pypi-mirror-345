{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a warning indicating the output is blocked by an item on the ground. It is currently working and has a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. It has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt and is currently not producing due to lack of input materials. The furnace has a source inventory for input materials and a result inventory containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities or terrain that might block placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to a new location\n- Verify that the destination location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity there.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This avoids exceptions related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that there is a clear path and sufficient space for the transport belt to connect between the desired start and end positions. Avoid obstacles that might prevent belt placement.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Make sure there is a sink entity or clear path for the output of production entities like drills and furnaces to prevent blockages."}
