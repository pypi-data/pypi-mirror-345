{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chests**: \n  - Iron chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Burner mining drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) fueled by coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n  - Multiple wooden chests positioned at (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5) used for storage purposes.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing resources are not full to avoid interruptions in mining operations. Regularly check and empty chests at positions like (x=4.5, y=-58.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors with Insertions into Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnaces have sufficient space to accommodate new iron ore insertions. This ensures that the processing of iron ore into iron plates is not halted.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore_count: int` - Represents the count of iron ore in inventory.\n  - `iron_plate_count: int` - Represents the count of iron plates in inventory.\n  - `coal_count: int` - Represents the count of coal in inventory."}
