{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-14.5, 14.5)\nLatest attempt at building a power system consists of:\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 14.5) facing DOWN\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Electric pole at (-11.5, 14.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting these components\nCurrently not functioning properly as connections are not complete\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) with drop position (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0)\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) with drop position (-20.5, -71.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0)\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel\n\n### Smelting Area near Origin\nGroup of furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab at unspecified position with automation science packs loaded\nCurrently not functioning due to lack of power\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing steam engines, ensure there is sufficient clear space considering the entity's tile dimensions (3x5 tiles)\n- Check for existing objects or entities before attempting placement\n- Consider the orientation and connection points when placing power system components\n\n### Power System Connection Issues\n- Ensure proper fluid connections between offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Verify steam engine orientation matches the intended flow direction\n- Connect all components in the correct sequence: water source \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine \u2192 electric pole\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drills and furnaces need constant fuel supply to operate\n- Ensure proper spacing between mining drills and their target furnaces\n- Maintain fuel levels in all burner devices to prevent operation interruption\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Electric poles must be properly connected to form a complete power network\n- Ensure power consumers (like labs) are within range of electric poles"}
