{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory Interface at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n\u2022 This structure forms the production interface for copper cables. It gathers materials from an input chest and feeds them via an inserter into an assembling machine.\n\u2022 Consists of:\n\u2003\u2013 Cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n\u2003\u2013 Factory burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) (placed using direction RIGHT)\n\u2003\u2013 Assembling machine (assembling-machine-1) at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5)\n\n### Belt Depot Structure at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\n\u2022 This structure serves as an isolated depot for multi\u2010segment belt connections between the extraction system and factory interface.\n\u2022 Consists of:\n\u2003\u2013 Wooden chest (belt depot) at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\n\u2003\u2013 Transport belt segment at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) placed adjacent to the chest\n\u2003\u2013 Depot burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) (placed using direction UP) which facilitates item pickup from the depot\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 When connecting transport belts, do not target a Prototype.SteamEngine directly. Instead, attach an inserter that feeds into the steam engine so that the belt\u2019s endpoint is a valid target.\n\n\u2022 Wooden Chest Placement Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the target placement position is within the allowed distance by moving closer before placing.  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify the inventory contains the required wooden chest prior to placement to avoid \u201cno wooden_chest in inventory\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Reference  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all variables (for example, ensuring \u201ctarget_chest\u201d is defined) are correctly declared and referenced consistently to avoid NameError exceptions."}
