{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5), boiler (position not specified), and offshore pump (position not specified). The steam engine is currently not receiving coal due to nearby entities blocking the connection points.\n\n### Electric pole at position(28.598, 30.008)\nConsists of a single electric pole that is currently not functional due to an error in removing it.\n\n### Electric poles at positions(55.5, 50.5) and (55.5, 55.5)\nNewly placed electric poles that are intended to extend the electricity network but may face placement issues due to terrain constraints.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain obstacles (like water) before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Make sure that there is a nearby entity (like a chest or a transport belt) that can accept coal before trying to insert it into the steam engine.\n\n### Errors when removing blocking entities\n- Confirm that the entity you are trying to remove is indeed removable and does not have any attributes that prevent its removal. Check for any dependencies or connections that might cause issues.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
