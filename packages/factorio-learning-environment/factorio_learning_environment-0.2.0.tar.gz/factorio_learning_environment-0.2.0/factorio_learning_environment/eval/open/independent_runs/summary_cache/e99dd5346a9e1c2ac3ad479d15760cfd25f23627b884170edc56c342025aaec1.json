You can define it using `from base.base_model import BaseModel` and then `class Entity(BaseModel):`.\n\n### NameError: name 'BaseModel' is not defined\n- When defining a class that inherits from BaseModel, make sure that the BaseModel class is imported. You can import it using `from base.base_model import BaseModel`.\n\n### AssertionError\n- Assertion errors are raised when an assert statement fails. Check the conditions of your assert statements to ensure they are valid. In this case, the error occurred when trying to get a burner inserter at a specific position, indicating that the inserter might not exist at that location.\n\n### Burner Inserter does not exist\n- When trying to get an entity at a specific position, make sure that the entity exists at that location.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `safe_insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int)`:\n  - Failure: `NameError: name 'Entity' is not defined`.
