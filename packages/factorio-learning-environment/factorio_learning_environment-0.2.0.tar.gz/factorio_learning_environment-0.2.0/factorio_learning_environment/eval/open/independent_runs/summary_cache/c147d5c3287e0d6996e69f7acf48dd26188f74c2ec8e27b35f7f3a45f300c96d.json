{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position(17.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (18.0, 71.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (20.0, 71.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 73.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (20.0, 73.0)\n\n#### Electricity Generator at position(-6.0, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-7.5, 0.0)\n- Pipe group connecting boiler to steam engine at positions (-6.5, -1.5), (-7.5, -1.5), (-4.5, -1.5), (-5.5, -1.5), (-3.5, -0.5), (-3.5, -1.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-3.5, 2.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too close to other entities\n- Ensure that there is enough space between entities when placing them. For example, when placing a burner inserter next to a furnace, make sure there are no other entities occupying the space where the inserter will be placed.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on unplaceable terrain or occupied positions\n- Check the terrain and existing entities before placing a new entity. For instance, ensure that the target location is not water or already occupied by another entity.\n\n#### Common mistakes and their solutions\n- Increasing the spacing between entities can help avoid placement errors.\n- Changing the direction of entity placement can also resolve issues related to entity proximity.\n- Verifying the reference position for entity placement is crucial to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs.
