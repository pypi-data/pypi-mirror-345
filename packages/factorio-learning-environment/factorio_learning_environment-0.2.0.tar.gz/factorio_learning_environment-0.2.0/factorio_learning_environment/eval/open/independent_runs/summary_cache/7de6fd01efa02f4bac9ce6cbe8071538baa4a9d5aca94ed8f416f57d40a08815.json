Always interpose an inserter that supplies items into the steam engine rather than connecting directly.\n\u2013 For placement errors showing \u201ctarget position is too far,\u201d ensure the player moves within the maximum allowed distance before attempting placement.\n\u2013 When an item is reported missing in inventory (for example, no wooden chest found), verify that the inventory contains the required entity prior to placement.\n\u2013 To avoid NameError issues (such as an undefined variable for the target chest), confirm that all variables are correctly defined and referenced before use."}
