{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 19.5) - Now connected to water system (fluid_system 13850)\n- **Boiler** at (18.0, 22.5) - Fueled with coal (39 units), producing steam at 165\u00b0C but still no input liquid connection\n- **Steam engine** at (22.5, 22.5) - Still unconnected to power network despite adjacent poles\n- **New offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Added but not connected to any system\n\n### Oil Processing Complex (Updated)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Still unpowered despite adjacent poles\n- **Oil refinery** at (27.5, 40.5) - Now has crude oil in fluid box (200 units) but remains unpowered\n- **Extended pipe network** - New crude oil pipes (fluid_system 13849) connecting pumpjack area to refinery\n\n### Chemical Production Setup\n- **Chemical plant** at (37.5, 22.5) - Still unpowered with sulfur recipe set\n- **Storage tank** at (32.5, 22.5) - Now connected via pipe-to-ground but empty\n- **Wooden chest** added at (40.5, 22.5) - Empty output target\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Fluid Connection Issues (Critical)\n- **Blocked connection points** - Verify all connection points are clear before pipe routing (recurring refinery connection failures)\n- **Power verification** - Check power status before fluid transfer attempts (pumpjack/refinery power issues)\n- **Fluid presence validation** - Confirm source has fluid before connection (empty storage tank connections)\n- **Direction alignment** - Ensure pipe routing matches entity connection directions (chemical plant input mismatch)\n\n### Power System Deficiencies\n- **Critical component power** - Prioritize power connection for production chain elements (refinery/pumpjack)\n- **Network coverage gaps** - Verify power pole placement covers all buildings (steam engine isolation)\n- **Steam system validation** - Check water input before expecting steam output (boiler input issues)\n\n### System Validation Best Practices\n- **Pre-connection diagnostics** - Implement connection point verification routine\n- **Power audit** - Systematically check power network coverage\n- **Fluid system isolation** - Test subsystems independently before full integration\n- **Entity status monitoring** - Check warnings/status flags before operations\n\n### Connection Protocol\n- **Clearance checks** - Physically verify connection point accessibility\n- **Fluid type matching** - Validate compatible fluids between systems\n- **Distance limitations** - Respect maximum pipe run distances\n- **Subsystem testing** - Verify individual components before system integration\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `connect_fluid_system()` - Requires pre-validation for power/fluid presence\n- `verify_power_connection()` - Needs implementation of network coverage check\n\n### Variables\n- `steam_engine_pos` - Still unconnected despite multiple attempts\n- `refinery_pos` - Now has crude oil but power issue persists\n- `chemical_plant_pos` - Multiple connection attempts failed\n- `output_chest_pos` - Defined but remains unused"}
