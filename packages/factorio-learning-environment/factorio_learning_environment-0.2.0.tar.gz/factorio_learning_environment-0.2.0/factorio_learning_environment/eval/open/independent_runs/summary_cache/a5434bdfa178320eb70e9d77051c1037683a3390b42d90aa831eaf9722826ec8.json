{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, y=-48.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-6.5, y=-48.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transfer System at Position (-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-15.5, y=-48.5) and (-14.5, y=-48.5) for temporary storage of iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from chests to the furnace, currently out of fuel.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System at Position (-7.5, y=-47.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-7.5, y=-47.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Non-Existent Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to interact with exists at the specified position. For example, attempting to access a wooden chest at position (-11.5, y=-44.5) resulted in an error due to the absence of the entity.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Names\n- Verify that all entity names used in your scripts are correctly defined. The error \"name 'Chest' is not defined\" suggests a missing or incorrect definition.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity for the inserter is not empty and is capable of providing items. Multiple inserters are waiting for source items, indicating potential issues with the supply chain.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters has enough space to accommodate incoming items. This issue arises when the destination is full, blocking the inserter's operation."}
