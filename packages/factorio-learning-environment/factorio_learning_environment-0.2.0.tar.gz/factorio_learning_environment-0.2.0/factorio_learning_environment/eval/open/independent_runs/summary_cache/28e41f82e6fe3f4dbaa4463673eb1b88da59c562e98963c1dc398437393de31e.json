{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5)\n\nThis structure is used for mining coal and storing it in the chest for further use.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing furnaces in non-buildable positions\n- Ensure the target position is clear and buildable before attempting to place a furnace. Check for obstructions or invalid terrain.\n\n#### Errors when trying to get a non-existent entity\n- Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. Use appropriate checks or ensure the entity is placed correctly.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into non-existent or incompatible entities\n- Ensure the target entity exists and can accept the item being inserted. For example, a furnace must be present and operational to accept coal.\n\n#### Repeated placement errors\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to place entities in the same invalid position. Double-check the position and ensure it is suitable for the entity type.\n\n#### Errors when extracting or inserting items without proper entity checks\n- Always verify the presence and compatibility of the target entity before performing extraction or insertion operations. This prevents errors related to missing or incompatible entities."}
