{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-111\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation (Water -> Steam -> Electricity)\n*   **Purpose:** Generates electricity from water using coal as fuel. The automated coal fueling system is currently dismantled.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Offshore Pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 (Extracts water, Status: WORKING)\n    *   Boiler at x=-5.0 y=2.5 (Heats water to steam using coal, Status: NO\\_FUEL)\n    *   Steam Engine at x=0.5 y=6.5 (Generates electricity from steam, Status: NOT\\_CONNECTED)\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler (fluid\\_system=22274, fluid=water, status=FULL\\_OUTPUT)\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Boiler to Steam Engine (fluid\\_system=22281, status=EMPTY)\n    *   *Note: The previous automated fueling subsystem (chest, inserters at x=-3.5 y=7.5, x=-3.5 y=6.5, x=-3.5 y=8.5) was removed in step 109. Multiple attempts to build a new transport belt path from the coal mine to the boiler failed and were cleaned up.*\n\n### Coal Mine (Basic Electric)\n*   **Purpose:** Mines coal and buffers it into chests. Intended source for power generation fuel.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Electric Mining Drill at x=15.5 y=-0.5 (Status: NO\\_POWER)\n    *   Wooden Chest (Output Buffer 1) at x=15.5 y=1.5 (Inventory: {'coal': 281})\n    *   Inserter (Miner -> Chest 1) at x=15.5 y=2.5 (Status: NO\\_POWER)"}
