Let me correct it by properly checking the entity types:\n\n```python\n# Get all entities and find our working drill\nentities = get_entities()\nworking_drill = None\nfor entity in entities:\n    if (hasattr(entity, 'status') and \n        'mining-drill' in str(entity) and \n        entity.status == EntityStatus.WORKING):\n        working_drill = entity\n        break\n\nif working_drill:\n    move_to(working_drill.position)\n    print(f\"Found working drill at: {working_drill.position}\")\n    \n    # Place a line of transport belts from the drill to the furnace\n    belt_start = working_drill.drop_position\n    \n    # First belt at drill output\n    belt1 = place_entity(\n        Prototype.TransportBelt,\n        position=belt_start,\n        direction=Direction.DOWN\n    )\n    \n    if belt1:\n        print(f\"Placed first belt at: {belt1.position}\")\n        \n        # Add burner inserter next to belt\n        inserter = place_entity_next_to(\n            Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n            reference_position=belt1.position,\n            direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n            spacing=1\n        )\n        \n        if inserter:\n            # Fuel the inserter\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n            print(f\"Placed and fueled inserter at: {inserter.position}\")\n            \n            # Place furnace where inserter can reach\n            furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n                Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n                reference_position=inserter.position,\n                direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n                spacing=1\n            )\n            \n            if furnace:\n                insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=10)\n                print(f\"Placed and fueled furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Current entity status: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Correctly identify the working mining drill\n2. Place a transport belt at its output\n3. Add an inserter to move items from belt to furnace\n4. Place and fuel a new furnace\n5. Ensure everything is properly connected and fueled\n\nLet me know if you see any issues with the setup and I can help adjust it further.", "summary_range": "[1-298]"}
