{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: 60 units of iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Fuel: None\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Out of fuel\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Function: Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Fuel Management\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and fueled to transfer materials between entities. Regularly check and refuel inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests to prevent overflow. Ensure that the chest at the mining drill's drop position is emptied to avoid mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Ensure that the inserter is properly configured to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors in Handling Full Inventories\n- Monitor the inventory levels of entities like chests and furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
