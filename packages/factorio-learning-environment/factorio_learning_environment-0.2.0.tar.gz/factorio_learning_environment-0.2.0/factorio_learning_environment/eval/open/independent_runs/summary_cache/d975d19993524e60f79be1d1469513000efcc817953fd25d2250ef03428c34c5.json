{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (4 units)\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, Stone Furnace\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated checks indicate issues with the inserter setup, causing the furnace not to receive iron ore.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to refuel essential entities like the mining drill and inserter. Insufficient coal can halt operations.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at the drop position to prevent mining operations from stopping due to a full chest. Ensure the chest has enough capacity to store mined resources.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace is currently not receiving iron ore, which is required for smelting operations. Check the inserter and supply chain to resolve this issue."}
