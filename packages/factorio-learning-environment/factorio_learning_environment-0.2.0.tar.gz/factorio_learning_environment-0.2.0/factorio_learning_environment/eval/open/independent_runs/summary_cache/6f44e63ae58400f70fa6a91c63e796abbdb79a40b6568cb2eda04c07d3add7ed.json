{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0) with burner inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5) and (-14.5, -45.5).\n- Wooden chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5), and (-9.5, -43.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5).\n- A series of transport belts connecting the furnaces and chests, facilitating the movement of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (-11.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), and (-14.5, -43.5) for moving items between belts and chests.\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5).\n- Boiler at position (-9.5, 22.0) which is not yet connected to the offshore pump due to connection issues.\n- Multiple PipeGroups, including one with water at position (-2.5, 3.5) and others at various positions, indicating attempts to establish a fluid system.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity poles forming an electricity group with poles at positions such as (-9.5, 6.5), (-9.5, 10.5), and others, though currently with no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that the correct type of pipe (either Pipe or UndergroundPipe) is used and available in inventory before attempting to connect entities.\n- Confirm that the connection path between the offshore pump and boiler is clear and within the maximum allowable distance for the pipes used.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Verify that all required materials are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items like pipes.\n\n### Errors in Placing Underground Pipes\n- Move closer to the target position before placing entities to ensure they are within the maximum placement distance.\n- Avoid placing entities where their footprint would overlap with water or other obstacles.\n\n### Attribute Errors\n- Double-check the API documentation for correct attribute names, such as using 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround'."}
