{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area (0,0 to 6,4)\nConsists of four stone furnaces:\n- Furnace 1 at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 3 at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace 4 at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients but have coal as fuel.\n\n### Research Lab Setup (10.5, 0.5)\nSingle lab structure with automation science packs loaded. Currently working with power connection.\n\n### Power Generation System (around -9.5, 24.5)\nComplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipe network between components\n- Small electric poles connecting power to lab\nSystem is operational with water flowing through pipes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to craft items\n- Check if you have necessary raw materials before attempting complex crafting chains\n\n### Recipe Chain Errors\n- When crafting complex items, ensure all prerequisite items are craftable or available\n- Some items like wood cannot be crafted and must be gathered from the environment\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Verify you have the required item in inventory before attempting to place structures\n- Ensure proper spacing between buildings when setting up production lines\n\n### Power System Errors\n- Connect all machines requiring electricity to the power network using electric poles\n- Ensure boilers have fuel and are properly connected to water supply\n\n### Crafting System Understanding\n- Some items require specific buildings (like furnaces or assembling machines) and cannot be hand crafted\n- Check recipe requirements before attempting to craft items\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations directly on prototype attributes\n- Ensure proper type handling when working with game object properties"}
