{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace used for smelting iron ore by inserting coal and iron ore. The furnace is positioned at x=-15.0 y=-50.0.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Smelting Process Timeouts and Insufficient Production\n- If the furnace does not complete smelting the expected quantity (e.g., 10 iron plates) within the set time, verify that the furnace has been supplied with correct inputs and allow adequate processing time.\n- Ensure that the furnace inventory is checked only after sufficient time has elapsed for processing to complete, to avoid assertion errors regarding low production output."}
