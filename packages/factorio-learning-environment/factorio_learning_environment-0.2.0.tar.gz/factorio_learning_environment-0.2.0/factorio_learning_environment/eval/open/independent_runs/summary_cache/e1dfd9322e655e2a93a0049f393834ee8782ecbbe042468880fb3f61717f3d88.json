{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: Iron ore, Iron plates\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plates\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Operations\n- Ensure to maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel all entities like mining drills and inserters to keep them operational.\n\n### Furnace Not Producing Iron Plates\n- Verify that the furnace has both iron ore and fuel available for smelting. Ensure that the inserter is properly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly check and clear the chest at the drop position to prevent mining drills from halting due to full inventory.\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring resources between entities."}
