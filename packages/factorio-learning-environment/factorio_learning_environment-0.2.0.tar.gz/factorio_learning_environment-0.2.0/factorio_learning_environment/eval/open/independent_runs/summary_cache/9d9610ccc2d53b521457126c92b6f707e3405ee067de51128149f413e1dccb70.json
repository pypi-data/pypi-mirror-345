{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### First Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with a fuel inventory containing coal (18). The furnace is currently empty with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Second Furnace at position (2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (2, 0)) with a fuel inventory containing coal (6). The furnace is currently empty with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure the furnace has enough space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. The first furnace reached its inventory limit (18/50 items) multiple times, preventing the insertion of iron plates.\n- Check the available items in the furnace before attempting to extract. The second furnace had no iron plates available for extraction, resulting in repeated failure messages.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before attempting to extract items to avoid errors related to insufficient items.\n\n### General inventory management\n- Regularly monitor your inventory to avoid attempting to insert more items than can be accommodated in the target entity's inventory."}
