{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving to a position\n- Ensure that the indices used for positions are integers. Avoid using strings as indices when moving to a position.\n\n### Errors when defining building dimensions\n- When defining dimensions for building boxes, ensure that the width and height are integers. Avoid using non-integer types such as strings or ModelPrivateAttr objects.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Verify that there is a valid and buildable spot available before attempting to place entities like Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests. Ensure that the area is clear and suitable for the entity's size.\n- Consider adjusting the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if no viable place is found for placement.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check that the target position for placing entities is not already occupied or restricted.\n- Ensure that the placement logic accounts for the terrain and any existing entities that might obstruct the placement.\n\nThese tips should help mitigate the errors encountered during the execution steps and facilitate successful placement and construction of structures in the game."}
