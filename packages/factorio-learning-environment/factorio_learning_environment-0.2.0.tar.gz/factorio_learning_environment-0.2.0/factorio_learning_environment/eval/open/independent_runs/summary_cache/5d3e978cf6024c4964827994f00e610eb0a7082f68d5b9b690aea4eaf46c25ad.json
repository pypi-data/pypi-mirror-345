{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-7.0,22.5)\n- **Boiler** at (-7.0,22.5) - Fueled with coal, water input connected\n- **Steam engine** at (-3.5,22.5) - Producing 15,000 energy, fully operational\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Connected via 7 water pipes (fluid_system=3454)\n- **Steam pipe network** (fluid_system=3452) - 6 pipes connecting boiler to steam engine\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Operational, connected to power grid\n- **Storage tank** at (21.5,40.5) - Contains 29.58 crude oil\n- **Oil pipe network** (fluid_system=3458) - 3 pipes connecting pumpjack to storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid System Connection Issues\n1. **Connection validation failures** (occurred 3 times)\n   - Always verify:\n     - Correct entity orientation before connecting\n     - Clear path between connection points\n     - Matching fluid types between components\n\n2. **Entity placement distance errors**\n   - Failed to place pipe at (-5.5,22.5) due to distance\n   - Solution:\n     - Move within 10 tiles of build location\n     - Implement position verification before placement\n\n3. **Prototype reference errors**\n   - Attempted to use non-existent Prototype.Pumpjack\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify exact prototype names in API documentation\n     - Use Prototype.PumpJack for oil extraction\n\n4. **Attribute access errors** (occurred 2 times)\n   - Failed to access fluid_box[0] on storage tank\n   - Solution:\n     - Check container structure before access\n     - Use proper indexing for fluid containers\n\n5. **System verification gaps**\n   - Power connection to pumpjack not properly validated\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement complete system checks:\n       1. Power network integrity\n       2. Fluid connections\n       3. Entity status verification\n\n### System Optimization Tips\n1. **Current throughput exceeds targets**:\n   - Crude oil production at 838.56/60s (target: 250/60s)\n   - Consider adding storage buffers\n   - Implement production throttling if needed\n\n2. **Maintenance procedures**:\n   - Monitor pipe network integrity\n   - Maintain backup power during expansions\n   - Document all system connections\n\n### Previous Recommendations Still Valid\n1. Implement staged activation procedures\n2. Maintain construction blueprints\n3. Create isolation procedures for failures\n4. Document all system connections"}
