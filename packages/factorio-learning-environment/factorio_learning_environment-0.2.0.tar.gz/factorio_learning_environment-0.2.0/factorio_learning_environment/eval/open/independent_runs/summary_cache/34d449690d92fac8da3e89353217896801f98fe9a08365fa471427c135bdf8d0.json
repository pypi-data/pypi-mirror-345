Confirm and employ the active fluid system identifier (currently [27628]) before attempting a connection.\n\n\u2022 Inadequate Pipeline Readiness Verification:\n  - Relying solely on a fixed 10\u2011second delay for pipeline stabilization has repeatedly failed to yield a working connection. Integrate dynamic connectivity checks to ensure readiness prior to initiating connection attempts."}
