{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) with a status of working and an inventory containing coal as fuel and iron plates as output.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) with a status of working and an inventory containing coal as fuel. It is connected to the wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for resource extraction.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when extracting from a chest that is full**\n  - Ensure to empty the wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) before attempting to extract more coal, as it will prevent further extraction.\n\n- **Errors when inserting into a furnace that is already working**\n  - Verify that the furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) has enough capacity to accept more iron ore before inserting.\n\n- **Errors when inserting fuel into the Burner Mining Drill**\n  - Make sure the Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) has enough space in its inventory to accept coal before inserting.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined**: \n  - None specified in the execution logs.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus"}
