Regularly check and refill fuel sources to maintain continuous operation.\n  \n- **Errors when using inserters:**\n  - Monitor the status of inserters. If they are waiting for source items or space in destination, ensure that the corresponding inventories are managed properly to avoid bottlenecks.\n\n- **Errors related to ingredient availability:**\n  - Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate. If it shows \"NO_INGREDIENTS,\" check the supply chain to ensure that iron ore is being delivered.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item(entity, item)`: Successfully invoked to insert items into entities such as the Stone Furnace and Burner Mining Drills.\n  - `harvest_resource(resource, position)`: Successfully invoked to harvest coal from the coal patch.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `coal: int` - Amount of coal available.\n  - `iron_ore: int` - Amount of iron ore available.\n  - `iron_plate: int` - Amount of iron plates produced.\n  - `wood: int` - Amount of wood available.\n  - `iron_gear_wheel: int` - Amount of iron gear wheels produced."}
