{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** (position x=2.0, y=-63.0) - Extracts iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** (position x=4.0, y=-63.0) - Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** (position x=3.5, y=-61.5) - Transfers items between the mining drill and furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** (position x=2.5, y=-61.5) - Stores items temporarily.\n- **Wooden Chest** (position x=4.5, y=-61.5) - Stores smelted iron plates.\n\n#### Copper Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** (position x=-28.0, y=-61.0) - Extracts copper ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** (position x=-26.0, y=-61.0) - Smelts copper ore into copper plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** (position x=-27.5, y=-62.5) - Transfers items between the mining drill and furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** (position x=-28.5, y=-62.5) - Stores items temporarily.\n- **Wooden Chest** (position x=-27.5, y=-59.5) - Stores smelted copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a chest\n- Ensure the chest contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n- Verify that the chest is accessible and not blocked by other entities.\n\n#### Errors when mining due to full chests\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue operating.\n- Ensure there is sufficient storage capacity for mined resources.\n\n#### Errors when smelting due to lack of ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore, copper ore) to avoid interruptions in smelting.\n- Check that inserters are correctly transferring items from mining drills to furnaces.\n\n#### Errors when smelting due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that furnaces and mining drills are supplied with sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) to maintain continuous operation.\n- Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **extract_item(Prototype.CopperOre, chest, quantity=10)**: Attempts to extract copper ore from a chest. Fails if the chest does not contain the specified item or if the chest is inaccessible.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **extracted_copper_ore**: Variable intended to store extracted copper ore. Type: `Item`.\n- **chest**: Variable representing the chest entity. Type: `Entity`."}
