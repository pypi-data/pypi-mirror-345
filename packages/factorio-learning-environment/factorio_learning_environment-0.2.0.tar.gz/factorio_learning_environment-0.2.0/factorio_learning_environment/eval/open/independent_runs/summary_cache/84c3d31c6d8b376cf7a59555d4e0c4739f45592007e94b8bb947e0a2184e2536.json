Verify the inventory of the source entity.\n- Ensure there is a nearby entity that can accept items from the inserter. Check the placement of inserters and their target entities.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Confirm that the target chest or entity has available items before attempting extraction. Regularly check and manage inventories to prevent extraction errors.\n\n### Errors with blocked transport belts\n- Regularly clear blockages on transport belts to ensure smooth operation. Check for any items that may be causing the blockage and remove them.\n\n### Errors with full chests\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent them from becoming full. Regularly empty chests to maintain continuous operation of connected entities like mining drills.\n\n### Errors with inventory management\n- Ensure that there is enough space in your inventory before attempting to harvest or extract items. Manage your inventory to prevent it from becoming full."}
