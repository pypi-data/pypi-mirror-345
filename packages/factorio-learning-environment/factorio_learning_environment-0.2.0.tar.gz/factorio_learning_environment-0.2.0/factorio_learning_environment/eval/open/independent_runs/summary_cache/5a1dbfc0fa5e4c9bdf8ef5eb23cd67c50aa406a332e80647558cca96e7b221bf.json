{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 26.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-3.5, 26.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (35.5, 27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and attempting to connect to the steam engine.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace at Position (10.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at Position (13.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at Position (16.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and producing iron plates.\n- Multiple wooden chests at Positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5).\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Lab at Position (unknown)\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack but currently has no power.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups at various positions, some of which are empty and others are part of the fluid system.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Check for any placement blockages that might prevent the connection between the boiler and steam engine. Ensure there is a clear path for the pipes to connect the two entities.\n\n### Errors due to no pipe in inventory\n- Ensure you have enough pipes in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors due to existing objects in the way\n- Verify that the target location for placing pipes or other entities is clear of any existing objects or terrain that might block placement.\n\n### Errors with incorrect use of API\n- Ensure that the API functions are called with the correct parameters and that the entities exist at the specified positions."}
