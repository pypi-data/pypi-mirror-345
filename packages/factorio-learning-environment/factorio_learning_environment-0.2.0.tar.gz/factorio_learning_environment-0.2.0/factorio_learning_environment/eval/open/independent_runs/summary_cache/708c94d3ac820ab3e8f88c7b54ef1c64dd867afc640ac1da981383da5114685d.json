{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new composite structures have been successfully established on the map. Multiple recovery attempts to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) have failed due to inventory shortages and unmet crafting prerequisites. Although the logs reference interactions with furnace entities\u2014one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used for iron smelting and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper smelting\u2014these were retrieved from the existing game environment rather than constructed by the agent. As a result, no new connected production or research facilities are present.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Consistency \u2013 When using get_entities(), ensure that the function is invoked with the correct signature. Avoid unsupported keywords (for example, do not pass \u2018radius\u2019 if it isn\u2019t supported) and verify that the number and type of arguments match the API expectations.\n\u2022 Lab Placement Verification \u2013 Always confirm that a Lab item is available in the inventory before attempting placement at (0.5, 2.5). This prevents errors due to missing components when trying to place new structures.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Requirements \u2013 Before crafting a Lab, check that all necessary sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available or can be produced with the existing setup. Address deficiencies by ensuring intermediate products (like iron-plates and copper-plates) can be processed through a functioning smelting or crafting chain.\n\u2022 Handling None Returns \u2013 Implement proper null checks when iterating over results from functions like get_entities() to avoid TypeErrors from attempting to iterate over a NoneType."}
