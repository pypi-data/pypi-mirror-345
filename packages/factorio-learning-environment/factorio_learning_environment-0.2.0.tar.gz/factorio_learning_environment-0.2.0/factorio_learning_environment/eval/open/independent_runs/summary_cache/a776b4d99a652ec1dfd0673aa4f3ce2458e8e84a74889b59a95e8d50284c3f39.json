{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Connected by pipes forming a water and steam system\n- Small electric pole (position x=0.5, y=8.5) connected to steam engine\n\nThe power generation system is currently not fully operational as the boiler is out of fuel despite having coal added earlier, and the steam engine is not properly connected to a power network.\n\n### Stone Mining Operation at position (-64.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-64.5, y=12.5)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-64.5, y=14.5) for collecting stone\n- Transport belt (position x=-64.5, y=15.5)\n- Connected to electricity network\n\nThe mining operation is extracting stone but currently has issues with power supply. The chest is collecting stone but is reported as full, limiting mining operations.\n\n### Stone Furnace Array at position (-41.0, 21.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 (position x=-41.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace 2 (position x=-36.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace 3 (position x=-31.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace 4 (position x=-26.0, y=21.0)\n\nAll furnaces have coal as fuel but are not receiving any ingredients to smelt. There were attempts to connect the stone mining operation to these furnaces with transport belts, but the connection was not successfully established.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of multiple small electric poles forming an electricity group (id=33789) with poles at various positions including:\n- (x=-15.5, y=28.5)\n- (x=-13.5, y=26.5)\n- (x=-47.5, y=26.5)\n- And many others\n\nThe electricity network has a voltage of 13500 but appears to be not properly connected to all structures that require power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is already occupied by another entity\n- When placing inserters near chests or other structures, ensure there's enough space around the target entity\n- Example: Attempting to place a burner inserter at (-64.5, 14.5) failed because a chest was already there\n\n### Errors when placing entities on unsuitable terrain\n- Verify that the terrain at the target location is suitable for the entity you're trying to place\n- Some entities cannot be placed on water or other special terrain types\n- Example: Attempting to place a stone furnace at (-21.0, 21.0) failed due to unsuitable terrain (water)\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that belt segments you're trying to connect form a valid path\n- Belt connections need to be in straight lines or proper curves\n- Example: Failed to connect transport belts from (-54.5, 16.5) to (-54.5, 19.0) due to invalid path\n\n### Errors when placing mining drills\n- Check for existing objects in the area before placing mining drills as they require a 3x3 space\n- Example: Could not place electric mining drill at (-61.5, 12.5) due to an existing object\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Ensure all electrical devices are properly connected to the power network via electric poles\n- The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network despite having a pole nearby\n- Electric mining drill is not receiving electricity despite the presence of an electricity network\n\n### Resource management issues\n- The boiler is out of fuel despite coal being added earlier, suggesting the coal may have been consumed\n- The stone chest at the mining drill is reported as full, limiting mining operations"}
