{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0) with pipes connecting various positions\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups connecting various fluid systems across different positions, such as:\n- PipeGroup at position (-48.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-46.5, -120.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, such as (31.5, -3.5) and (29.5, -0.5), providing electrical connections\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located at an unspecified position\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Ensure that the required item is available in the inventory before attempting to place it. In this case, the burner mining drill was not in the inventory, causing a placement error.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in entities like boilers and furnaces to ensure they are operational. The boiler is out of fuel, which can halt electricity generation.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The stone furnaces are currently lacking ingredients, preventing them from producing outputs.\n\n### Errors Due to No Input Liquid\n- Verify that all connections to the steam engine are properly configured to allow fluid flow. The steam engine is not receiving input liquid, which affects its functionality."}
