{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with output blocked due to lack of a sink entity.\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5) aligned with a Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -81.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -81.5) containing coal.\n- Additional Burner Inserters and Transport Belts configured to move resources between entities.\n\n### Storage and Handling System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) and Iron Chest at position (42.5, -80.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserters positioned to manage the transfer of items between chests and belts.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups and standalone belts:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs facilitating the movement of resources across different sections.\n- Several belts connecting various positions, ensuring the flow of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter and Chest\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with the target chests to facilitate proper item transfer.\n\n### AttributeError in BeltGroup Object\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup object has the correct attributes defined before accessing them. Review the object definition for completeness.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Distance\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles."}
