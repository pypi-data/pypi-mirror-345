To resolve this, always insert an intermediary (such as an inserter that accepts items into the target entity) rather than connecting a belt directly to a steam engine.\n\n\u2022 Wooden Chest Placement Issues\n\u2003A placement error occurred because the target position (3.5, 15.5) was too far from the player\u2019s current position, and later because no wooden chest was available in the inventory. Ensure that the player moves within the maximum placement distance and that the required item is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Error\n\u2003A NameError for \u2018target_chest\u2019 was raised due to an undefined variable. Verify that all variable names are declared correctly and consistently referenced throughout the code."}
