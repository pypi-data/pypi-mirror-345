{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate and Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 11 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Current inventory: 3 copper plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 7 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Current inventory: 4 copper plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (4.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 2 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Current inventory: 3 copper plates\n\n### Research Facility at Position (8.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (8.5, 0.5)\n  - Input: 10 automation science packs\n  - Status: No power\n  - Research: Automation\n\n### Power Infrastructure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n  - Status: Not connected\n  - Warnings: No fluid present in connections\n- Small Electric Pole at positions (5.5, 1.5) and (4.5, 1.5)\n  - Voltage: 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Missing Stone Furnace\n- Ensure to gather necessary resources, such as stone, before attempting to craft a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Iron Plates\n- Verify that the stone furnace contains iron plates before attempting to extract them.\n- Ensure that the extraction quantity does not exceed the available amount in the furnace.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Ingredients\n- Regularly check the furnace's inventory to ensure it has the required ingredients for smelting.\n- Maintain a steady supply of iron ore to keep the furnace operational.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is available in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n\n### Errors Due to Locked Recipes\n- Research the necessary technologies to unlock crafting recipes, such as the automation technology for assembling machines.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Verify that the items you wish to insert are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure.\n\n### Errors When Crafting Copper Cables\n- Ensure that you have the required copper plates available in your inventory or furnaces before attempting to craft copper cables.\n\n### Errors When Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before placing a small electric pole. If obstructed, try a different position.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Specify the type of connection you want to make when connecting entities, such as using a transport belt for item transport.\n\n### Errors When Placing Offshore Pump\n- Ensure the offshore pump is placed adjacent to a water source and is available in your inventory before placement.\n\n### Errors When Crafting Boiler\n- Gather the necessary raw resources, such as stone, to craft a stone furnace, which is a prerequisite for crafting a boiler.\n\n### Errors When Placing Boiler\n- Ensure the boiler's footprint does not overlap with water or other entities. Choose a suitable location for placement."}
