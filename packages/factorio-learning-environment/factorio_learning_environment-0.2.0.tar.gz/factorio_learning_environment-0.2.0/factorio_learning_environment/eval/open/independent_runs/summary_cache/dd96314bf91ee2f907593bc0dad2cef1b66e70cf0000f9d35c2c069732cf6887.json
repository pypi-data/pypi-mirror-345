{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 80-87)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (14.5, 8.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (14.5, 8.0) (status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n- Steam engine at (17.5, 8.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Small electric poles at (19.5, 9.5) and (17.5, 11.5)\n- Partial water pipe connection from offshore pumps\n\n### Secondary Boiler at position (14.5, 11.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (14.5, 11.0) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- No steam engine or proper connections\n\n### New Boiler at position (2.5, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (2.5, 0.0) (status: NOT_CONNECTED, warnings: out of fuel, no input liquid)\n- Connection points at (0.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5)\n- Steam output point at (2.5, -1.5)\n\n### Oil Processing Complex\nConsists of:\n- Oil refinery at (15.5, 15.5) (status: NO_POWER, recipe: BasicOilProcessing)\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) (status: NO_POWER)\n- Partial pipe network for crude oil (status: EMPTY)\n- Storage tank at (10.5, 15.5)\n- Missing power connections throughout\n\n### Chemical Plant Complex at position (6.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chemical plant (status: NO_POWER, recipe: sulfur)\n- Small electric poles at (8.5, 10.5), (8.5, 13.5), and (7.5, 14.5)\n- Missing petroleum gas input and power\n\n### Water Pipe Network\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -2.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Extensive pipe network with multiple pipe groups:\n  - Working water pipes (status: FULL_OUTPUT) centered at (-8.5, -2.5)\n  - Empty pipe sections (status: EMPTY) throughout the map\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Pipe Placement Issues\n- Repeated attempts to place pipes on occupied tiles (-8.5,-2.5), (1.0,-1.0), (1.0,-0.5) (steps 80, 83, 86, 87)\n- Verify tile is clear before placing pipes\n- Implement collision detection for pipe placement\n\n### Fluid System Connection Issues\n- Failed pumpjack-to-refinery connection due to empty source (step 82)\n- Verify fluid presence before attempting connections\n- Ensure proper pipe routing between fluid entities\n\n### Placement Distance Errors\n- Attempted to place boiler too far from player position (step 85)\n- Move within placement range (10 tiles) before attempting placement\n\n### Persistent Issues from Previous Reports\n- Placement on occupied tiles (still occurring)\n- Power grid connectivity (still occurring)\n- Connection point index errors (still occurring)\n- Fluid system validation (still occurring)"}
