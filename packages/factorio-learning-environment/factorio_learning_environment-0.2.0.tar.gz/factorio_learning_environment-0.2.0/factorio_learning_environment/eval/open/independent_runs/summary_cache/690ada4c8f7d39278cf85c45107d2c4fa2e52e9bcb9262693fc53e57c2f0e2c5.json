{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities and facilitating steam and water flow\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) with iron plate output\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) with iron plate output\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) for copper cable production\n- Inserter at Position (7.5, 5.5) supplying copper plates\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) storing iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Mining at Position (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (19.5, 18.5) storing copper ore\n\n### Storage Facility at Position (-3.5, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 2.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) transferring items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For instance, the error \"Could not place wooden-chest at (8.5, 0.5), No wooden_chest in inventory\" indicates a missing item in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in production\n- Regularly check and ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for production processes. The assembling machine had a warning for missing copper plates needed for copper cable production.\n\n### Errors when using inserters without source items\n- Verify that the source items are available for inserters to function correctly. Inserters waiting for source items indicate a need to supply the required materials."}
