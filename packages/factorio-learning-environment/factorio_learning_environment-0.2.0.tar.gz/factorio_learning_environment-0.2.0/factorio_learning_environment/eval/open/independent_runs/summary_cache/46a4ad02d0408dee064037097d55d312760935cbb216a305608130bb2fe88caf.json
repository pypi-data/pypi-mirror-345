{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Water Supply System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5), storage tank (position x=-6.5, y=-0.5) and pipes connecting them (PipeGroup at position x=-8.5, y=-0.5). The water supply system is attempted to be connected to the boiler (position x=21.5, y=44.0) through a complex network of pipes.\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction System at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of pumpjack (position x=17.5, y=40.5), crude oil storage tank (position x=21.5, y=40.5) and pipes connecting them (PipeGroup at position x=18.5, y=38.5). The crude oil storage tank is connected to the oil refinery through pipes (PipeGroup at position x=11.5, y=33.5).\n\n### Electricity Generation System at position(21.5, 44.0)\nConsists of boiler (position x=21.5, y=44.0), steam engine (position x=25.5, y=46.5) and pipes attempted to be connected between boiler and steam engine (PipeGroup). The steam engine is connected to the pumpjack and oil refinery through power poles (ElectricityGroup id=81070).\n\n### Oil Refinery at position(29.5, 39.5)\nConsists of oil refinery (position x=29.5, y=39.5) connected to the crude oil storage tank through pipes and to the steam engine through power poles.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or unplaceable positions\n- Ensure the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity. (Step 3)\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure entities are properly aligned and positioned to be connected with pipes. Clear potential blockages before attempting to connect entities. (Step 5, Step 6, Step 11, Step 16, Step 21, Step 23, Step 26, Step 27, Step 29, Step 30, Step 33, Step 36, Step 37, Step 40, Step 41, Step 42, Step 44, Step 45, Step 48, Step 49, Step 51, Step 52, Step 53, Step 54, Step 55, Step 56, Step 61, Step 62, Step 63)\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of entities\n- Ensure the entity has an inventory before attempting to inspect it. (Step 9, Step 18, Step 22, Step 32)\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of entities\n- Ensure the attribute exists for the entity before attempting to access it. (Step 10)\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without fluid in the source entity\n- Ensure the source entity has fluid in it before attempting to connect it to another entity. (Step 8, Step 16, Step 21, Step 26, Step 27, Step 29, Step 30, Step 33, Step 36, Step 37, Step 40, Step 41, Step 42, Step 44, Step 45, Step 48, Step 49, Step 51, Step 52, Step 53, Step 54, Step 55, Step 61, Step 62, Step 63)\n\n### Errors when clearing pipes\n- Ensure the argument passed to clear pipes is an Entity or Prototype object. (Step 15, Step 29, Step 30, Step 36)\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before using them. (Step 28, Step 43, Step 59)\n\n### Errors when entities are not receiving electricity\n- Ensure entities that require electricity are connected to a power source. (Step 42, Step 46, Step 47, Step 48, Step 49, Step 51, Step 52, Step 53, Step 54, Step 55, Step 61, Step 62, Step 63)\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Function signature: `connect_entities_with_pipes(entity1, entity2)`\n- Description: Attempts to connect two entities with pipes.\n- Invocation summary: \n  - Success: When entities are properly aligned and have available connections.\n  - Failure: When entities are not properly aligned or have blocked connections.\n\n### Variables:\n- `entity1`: Entity object to be connected.\n- `entity2`: Entity object to be connected.\n- `pipe`: Pipe entity used for connection.\n\nNo other utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
