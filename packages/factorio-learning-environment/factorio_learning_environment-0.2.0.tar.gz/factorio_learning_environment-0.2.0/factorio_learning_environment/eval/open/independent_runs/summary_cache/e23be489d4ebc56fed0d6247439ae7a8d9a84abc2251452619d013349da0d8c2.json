Verify the start and end positions of the pipes before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Check for any existing entities that might block the placement.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter."}
