Use proper attribute access rather than invoking center() if it is a property.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Connection Failures\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the boiler\u2019s connection points and the steam engine\u2019s connection points are aligned and unobstructed.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that no interfering entities block the pipe path; clear or reposition such obstructions before attempting pipe connections.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure sufficient pipe components and compatible connection parameters are available to complete the integration.\n\n\u2022 Buildable Area and Repositioning Errors\n\u2003\u2013 Validate candidate positions for buildability before finalizing repositioning. Errors such as \u201cCandidate position not buildable\u201d and \u201cNo buildable candidate positions found near desired center\u201d indicate that the selected positions are obstructed.\n\u2003\u2013 When automated candidate scans in the immediate (\u00b11 tile) search range fail, consider an extended search but be prepared to abort if no valid buildable area is found.\n\u2003\u2013 In manual repositioning, pre\u2010check candidate positions for buildability to avoid aborting the routine."}
