{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) and a Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) for transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) and a Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for processing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) for transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Additional Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that there is sufficient inventory of the item you are trying to insert. For example, before inserting iron ore into a furnace, verify that your inventory contains enough iron ore.\n\n### Errors when mining with full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests at mining drill drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full chests. For example, empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
