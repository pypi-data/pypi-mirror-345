{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5), containing 681 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5), containing 722 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-83.5), containing 450 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=44.5, y=-83.5), containing 411 units of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5), transferring coal from the chest at (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to the chest at (x=40.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0), currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0), currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5), containing stone bricks, wood, coal, and stone.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=62.5, y=-53.5), containing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=62.5, y=-52.5), containing coal.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- Transport Belt starting at position (x=43.5, y=-81.5), intended to receive coal from an inserter.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to craft large quantities of items. Consider moving excess items to storage chests to free up inventory slots.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Ensure that you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position when placing entities. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place the entity.\n- Verify that the target location is suitable for placement and is not obstructed by other entities or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water).\n\n### Connection Errors\n- When connecting transport belts to furnaces, use an inserter to input items into the furnace rather than attempting to connect belts directly.\n\n### Resource Availability Errors\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. Craft or acquire the necessary items if they are not available.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- `craft_item`: Function used to craft items, requires sufficient inventory space to succeed.\n- `place_entity`: Function used to place entities on the map, requires proximity to the target position and availability of the entity in the inventory.\n- `connect_entities`: Function used to connect entities, requires appropriate intermediate entities (e.g., inserters) for certain connections.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- `crafted_gears`: List of crafted iron gear wheels.\n- `belt_start_position`: Starting position for placing transport belts.\n- `inserter_1_position`: Position for placing the first burner inserter.\n- `alternative_inserter_1_position`: Alternative position for placing the first burner inserter."}
