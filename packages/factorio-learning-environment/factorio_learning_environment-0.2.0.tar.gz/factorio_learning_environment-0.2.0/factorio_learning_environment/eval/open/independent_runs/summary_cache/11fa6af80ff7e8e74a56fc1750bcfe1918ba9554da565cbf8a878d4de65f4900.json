{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at Position(x=-26.0, y=-61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-26.0, y=-61.0) with fuel and iron ore being smelted into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-27.5, y=-62.5) transferring items between the chest and the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-28.5, y=-62.5) storing coal and other items.\n\n#### Copper and Iron Mining Setup at Position(x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0) mining copper and iron ore, currently out of fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-27.5, y=-59.5) storing mined iron and copper ore.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at Position(x=4.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) with fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) transferring items between the chest and the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) storing iron ore.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at Position(x=6.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) with fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at Position(x=8.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=8.0, y=-63.0) with no fuel and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting copper ore from a chest\n- Ensure the chest contains the required item (copper ore) and is accessible before attempting extraction.\n\n#### Errors when crafting iron plates without a crafting machine or furnace\n- Use a furnace or crafting machine to smelt or craft items like iron plates. Direct crafting is not possible for these items.\n\n#### Errors with mining drills running out of fuel\n- Ensure mining drills are fueled with coal or other fuel sources to continue operation.\n\n#### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) for smelting.\n\n#### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure inserters have access to items to transfer, either from a chest or another source.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **extract_item(Prototype, entity, quantity)**: Used to extract items from entities like chests. Fails if the item is unavailable or the entity is inaccessible.\n- **craft_item(Prototype, quantity)**: Used to craft items. Fails if the recipe requires a crafting machine or furnace.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **extracted_copper_ore**: Variable intended to store extracted copper ore, but extraction failed multiple times.\n- **crafted_plates**: Variable intended to store crafted iron plates, but crafting failed due to lack of a furnace."}
