{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) [Status: WORKING]\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) [Status: NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Steam engine at position (-13.5, 23.5) [Status: NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Multiple pipe groups at various positions, including:\n  - Pipe group at (-9.5, 23.5) [Status: FULL_OUTPUT]\n  - Pipe groups at (-10.5, 22.5), (-10.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-5.5, 16.5), (-5.5, 24.5), (-4.5, 16.5), and (-4.5, 24.5) [Status: EMPTY]\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) [Status: NO_INGREDIENTS]\n\n### Electricity Group at Position (-3.67, 20.21)\n- Electricity group at position (-3.67, 20.21) [Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK]\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing entity at the target position before placing a pipe. Clear any existing entities if necessary.\n- Verify that there is sufficient inventory of pipes before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Avoid attempting to connect pipes over water or other obstacles. Select a clear path for pipe connections.\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and within connection range to establish a valid connection.\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory\n- Regularly check inventory levels to ensure necessary items are available for construction and placement tasks.\n\n### Errors with Unconnected Entities\n- Ensure all components of the electricity generator are properly connected to each other and to the electric network to function correctly."}
