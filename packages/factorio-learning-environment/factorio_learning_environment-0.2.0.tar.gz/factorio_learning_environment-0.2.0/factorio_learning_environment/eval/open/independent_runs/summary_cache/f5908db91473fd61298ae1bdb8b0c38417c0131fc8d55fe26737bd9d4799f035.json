{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=53.5, y=-80.5) receiving coal from the drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) transferring coal from the first chest to the second chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-78.5) storing coal transferred by the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-76.5) prepared to transfer coal from the second chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting System at Position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) receiving iron ore from the drill.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-48.5) prepared to transfer items (currently waiting for source items).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) prepared to transfer items (currently waiting for source items).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) available for storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from halting due to full chests. The chest at position (-11.5, y=-49.5) frequently becomes full, stopping the mining drill.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that inserters have a continuous supply of items to transfer. The inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) is waiting for source items, which indicates a disruption in the supply chain.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
