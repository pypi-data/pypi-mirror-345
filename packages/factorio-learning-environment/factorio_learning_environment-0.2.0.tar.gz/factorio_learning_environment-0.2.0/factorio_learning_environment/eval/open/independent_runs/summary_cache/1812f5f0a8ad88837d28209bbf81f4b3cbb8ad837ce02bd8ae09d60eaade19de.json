{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 5), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 4), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 10), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: \n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0), fueled by coal, currently working but with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing resources have enough capacity. Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Efficient Resource Allocation\n- Distribute resources evenly among furnaces to maintain a balanced production rate and prevent any single furnace from running out of input materials prematurely.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore: int` - Total iron ore in inventory: 143\n- `iron_plate: int` - Total iron plates in inventory: 5498\n- `coal: int` - Total coal in inventory: 470\n- `wood: int` - Total wood in inventory: 10\n- `iron_gear_wheel: int` - Total iron gear wheels in inventory: 4"}
