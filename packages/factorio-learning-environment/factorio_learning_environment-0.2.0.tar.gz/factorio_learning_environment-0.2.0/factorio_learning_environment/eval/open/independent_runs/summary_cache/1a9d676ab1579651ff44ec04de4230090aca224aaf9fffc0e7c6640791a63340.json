{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 3.0) with coal fuel (21 coal remaining)\n- Steam engine at position(1.5, 7.5)\n- Connected with pipe network between components\n- Currently operational and producing power\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Line at Position(18.5, 73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position(18.5, 73.5) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position(19.0, 77.0) with coal fuel (50 coal remaining)\n- Assembling machine 2 at position(24.5, 77.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Wooden chest at position(22.5, 77.5) for input storage\n- Wooden chest at position(27.5, 77.5) for output storage (currently contains 170 iron gear wheels)\n- Inserter at position(26.5, 77.5) to move finished gear wheels to chest\n- Small electric poles connecting all electrical components\n- Currently operational, producing iron gear wheels when iron plates are available\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position(34.5-38.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two electric mining drills at positions(34.5, 70.5) and (38.5, 70.5) mining iron ore\n- Transport belts at positions(34.5, 72.5) and (38.5, 72.5) at drill outputs\n- Underground belt system connecting the two mining drills (entry at 35.5, 72.5 and exit at 37.5, 72.5)\n- Belt group from position(38.5, 72.5) to position(38.5, 75.5) for iron ore transport\n- Stone furnace at position(39.0, 77.0) with coal fuel (48 coal remaining)\n- Inserter at position(40.5, 77.5) moving iron plates from furnace to belt\n- Transport belt line from position(41.5, 77.5) to position(49.5, 77.5) for iron plate transport\n- Small electric poles connecting all electrical components\n- Currently partially operational, mining iron ore and transporting iron plates\n\n### Manual Iron Smelting Station at Position(30.0, 77.0) and Position(33.0, 77.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position(30.0, 77.0) with coal fuel (16 coal remaining)\n- Stone furnace at position(33.0, 77.0) with coal fuel (8 coal remaining)\n- Currently operational but waiting for iron ore input\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces; use inserters as intermediaries\n- When creating belt paths, ensure there's a valid path between start and end positions\n- Check that belt placement positions are clear of obstacles\n- When connecting distant belt segments, use underground belts or ensure a continuous path\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to place new ones at the same position\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Verify the target location is clear before placing entities\n- Some areas may be unplaceable due to water or other terrain features\n- Check for existing entities that might block placement\n- When repositioning components, ensure you have a clear understanding of the required space\n- Use the error message to identify exactly what's blocking placement\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Ensure inserters are properly aligned with input/output positions\n- Check that inserter pickup and drop positions match with the intended source and target entities\n- Pay attention to inserter direction when placing\n- Verify there's enough space around the inserter for proper operation\n- Try alternative directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) if the initial placement fails\n\n### Errors with entity connections\n- When using `connect_entities()`, ensure there's a valid path between the entities\n- For distant connections, create intermediate connection points\n- Ensure the connection type is appropriate for the entities being connected\n- For belt connections, create a continuous path of adjacent belts\n\n### Factory design considerations\n- When building production lines, ensure proper spacing between components\n- Plan the layout to accommodate all required connections between entities\n-"}
