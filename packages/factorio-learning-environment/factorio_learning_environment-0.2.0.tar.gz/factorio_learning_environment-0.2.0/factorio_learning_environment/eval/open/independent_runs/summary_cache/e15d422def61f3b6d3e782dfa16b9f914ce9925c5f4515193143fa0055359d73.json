{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) collecting iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the target location before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent placement errors such as those encountered when trying to place a wooden chest at (-14.5, -47.5).\n\n### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to interact with it. This will avoid errors like trying to get a wooden chest that does not exist at the specified position.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources in inventory\n- Ensure that the necessary resources are available in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. This will prevent errors when trying to insert coal into an inserter without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when entities are not functioning due to lack of fuel or resources\n- Regularly refuel entities such as mining drills and inserters to maintain their operation. Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt, as indicated by the error where the furnace was not receiving iron ore."}
