{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-48, -47)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5), used for storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0), fueled with coal, converting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - At position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - At position (-8.5, -47.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to the output chest.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - At position (-7.5, -47.5), serving as an output chest for iron plates.\n  - At position (-6.5, -47.5), additional storage for iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters with insufficient resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for space in destination\n- Regularly monitor and clear the output chests to ensure inserters have space to deposit items.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) have sufficient items for the inserters to transfer. Regularly refuel and restock these entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Always keep a sufficient supply of fuel (e.g., coal) in your inventory to refuel mining drills, furnaces, and inserters as needed."}
