{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore extraction and storage.\n\n### Copper and Iron Ore Processing at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) for processing copper and iron ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the stone furnace, facilitating the movement of resources.\n\n### Iron Plate Production and Storage at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storage of produced iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Inserter and Chest at Position (-20.5, -65.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) with a pickup position at (-21.5, -65.5) and a drop position at (-19.5, -65.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) for storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Entity Retrieval\n- Ensure that the target entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors such as \"No entity of type stone-furnace found at the specified position.\"\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Make sure the inserter has a valid sink entity to accept its output to avoid being blocked by items on the ground.\n- Ensure inserters are adequately fueled to maintain operational status.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing entities."}
