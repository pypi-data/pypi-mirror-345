{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production at position(16, 71)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position (16.0, 71.0)) \n- Stone furnace (position (16.0, 73.0))\n- Burner inserter (position (16.5, 75.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (16.5, 69.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (17.5, 74.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (16.5, 74.5))\n- BeltGroup (positions (16.5, 68.5) to (16.5, 76.5))\n\n### Iron gear wheel production at position(19.5, 74.5)\nConsists of following entities\n- Assembling machine 2 (position (19.5, 74.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (17.5, 74.5)) that takes iron plates from the wooden chest and puts them into the assembling machine\n- Small electric pole (position (17.5, 73.5)) that powers the assembling machine\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-9.5, -0.5) and (-5.5, 6.0) and (-0.5, 10.5)\nConsists of following entities\n- Offshore pump (position (-9.5, -0.5))\n- Boiler (position (-5.5, 6.0))\n- Steam engine (position (-0.5, 10.5))\n- PipeGroup (positions (-8.5, -0.5) to (-7.5, 6.5)) that connects offshore pump to boiler\n- PipeGroup (positions (-4.5, 4.5) to (-0.5, 7.5)) that connects boiler to steam engine\n- Small electric pole (position (1.5, 11.5)) that powers the steam engine\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n  - Ensure that there are no obstacles between the entities and that the connection points are not blocked. For example, connecting an offshore pump to a boiler.\n* Errors when placing entities at a position that is already occupied\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. For example, placing a pipe at position (-8.5, -0.5) when there is already a boiler at position (-8.0, -0.5).\n* Errors when entities are not connected to a power network\n  - Ensure that entities that require power are connected to a power network. The assembling machine at position (19.5, 74.5) is receiving electricity now.\n* Errors when furnace result is full\n  - Ensure that the furnace result is extracted before it becomes full to avoid production halt. The furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) has a full result inventory.\n* Errors when output is blocked by items on the ground\n  - Ensure that there is a clear path for output. The burner inserter at position (16.5, 69.5) and the burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) have their output blocked by items on the ground.\n* Errors when attempting to insert items into a full inventory\n  - Ensure that the inventory is not full before attempting to insert items. \n* Errors due to incorrect prototype names\n  - Ensure that the prototype names used are correct. \n* Errors when there are no ingredients to smelt\n  - Ensure that there are ingredients to smelt in the furnace. The furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) had no ingredients to smelt initially.\n* Errors when placing a pipe or underground pipe at a position occupied by another entity\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a pipe or underground pipe.\n* Errors when mining drill is out of fuel\n  - Ensure that the mining drill has fuel to continue operating. The burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) was out of fuel.\n* Errors when boiler or steam engine is out of fuel\n  - Ensure that the boiler or steam engine has fuel to continue operating. The boiler at position (-5.5, 6.0) and the burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) were out of fuel.\n* Errors when attempting to access non-existent entities\n  - Ensure that entities exist before attempting to access them. For example, attempting to get a steam engine at a position where it does not exist.\n* Errors when attempting to insert non-existent items into an entity\n  - Ensure that the items to be inserted exist in the inventory. For example, attempting to insert coal into a boiler when there is no coal in the inventory.\n\n### NAMES"}
