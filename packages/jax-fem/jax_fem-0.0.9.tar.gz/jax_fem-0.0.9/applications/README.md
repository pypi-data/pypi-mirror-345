# Instructions

This folder contains more advanced JAX-FEM examples (mostly without documentation). For more elementary and tutorial purpose examples, please visit [tutorial](https://github.com/tianjuxue/jax-fem/tree/main/demos) for more information.

TODO (if there is certain interest):

1. Mass lumping explicit dynamics
1. RVE mechanics (solve for fluctuation field)
