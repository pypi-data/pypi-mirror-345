{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of four stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) \n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have coal fuel but currently have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) connected via pipes, currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipe network carrying water from pump to boiler\n- Connected pipe network for steam from boiler to engine\n- Small electric pole at (6.5, 24.5) distributing power\n\n### Research Lab at (10.5, 0.5)\n- Lab building with 2 automation science packs loaded\n- Connected to power network but currently has no power\n- Researching automation technology\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nNetwork of small electric poles connecting power generation to the lab:\n- Poles at positions: (8.5,10.5), (8.5,14.5), (8.5,2.5), (8.5,6.5), (6.5,24.5), (8.5,18.5)\nCurrent voltage: 496909\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting crafting operations\n- Check inventory for required fuel (coal) before attempting to insert into furnaces\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Cannot place entities without having them in inventory first (e.g. offshore pump placement failed)\n- Verify you have crafted required items before attempting placement\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Errors\n- Some items like copper plates and iron plates require furnace smelting, cannot be directly crafted\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered, not crafted\n- Verify all recipe ingredients are available before attempting to craft items\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations directly on prototype attributes\n- Ensure entities are properly connected before attempting fluid transfers\n- Make sure to have required items in inventory when attempting to connect entities with pipes\n\n### Power System Errors\n- Ensure complete power system chain (fuel \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine \u2192 electric poles \u2192 consumers)\n- Add fuel to boilers to generate power\n- Connect all power-consuming entities to the electricity network via electric poles"}
