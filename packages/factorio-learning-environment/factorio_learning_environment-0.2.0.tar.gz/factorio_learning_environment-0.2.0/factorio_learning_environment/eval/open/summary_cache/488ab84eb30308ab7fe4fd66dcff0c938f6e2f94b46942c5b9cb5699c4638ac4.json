{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), facing down, currently out of fuel\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0), facing up, currently out of fuel and without ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5), used to collect iron plates\n- Burner inserter initially placed at position (18.5, 73.5) to move iron plates from furnace to chest, later picked up\n\nThis structure is intended to extract iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and collect the plates in the chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters due to occupied tiles or inventory shortages\n- When placing an inserter next to the furnace at (16.0, 73.0), the wooden chest at (17.5, 73.0) blocked placement. To fix this, increase spacing, change placement direction, or adjust reference position to avoid overlapping existing entities.\n- Attempts to place burner inserters at the drill drop position (16.5, 72.5) and next to the drill failed because the required inserters were not available in inventory. Ensure sufficient inserters are in inventory before placement.\n- Similarly, placing a regular inserter at (16.5, 72.5) failed due to lack of inserters in inventory. Maintain adequate inserter stock or craft more before placement.\n\n### Fuel and ingredient management errors\n- The furnace and burner mining drill repeatedly ran out of fuel, causing them to stop working. Consistently insert coal into these entities to keep them operational.\n- The furnace reported no ingredients to smelt despite the drill working, indicating a possible issue with ore transfer or extraction.\n\n### Extraction and variable usage errors\n- Extraction attempts at the drill drop position (16.5, 72.5) failed because no valid iron ore entity was found at that position. Verify correct drop positions and ensure the drill is properly fueled and working.\n- A NameError occurred due to use of an undefined variable `extracted_ore`. Define and assign this variable properly before using it in conditional statements.\n\n### Crafting errors due to missing sub-ingredients and machines\n- Crafting burner inserters failed because iron plates, a required sub-ingredient, cannot be crafted without a crafting machine or furnace. Ensure iron plates are available or set up automated smelting before crafting burner inserters.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent so far."}
