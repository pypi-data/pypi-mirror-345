{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x)\nConsists of steam engine (position x1), boiler (position y), and offshore pump (position z)\n\n### Electric pole placements\n- Electric pole placed at (53.5, 49.5)\n- Electric pole placed at (53.5, 54.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that cannot be traversed (e.g., water). Check the positions before placing.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Ensure that the steam engine is nearby and accessible for coal insertion. If there are no nearby entities that can accept coal, reposition or clear the area.\n\n### Errors related to terrain checks\n- Verify that the specified location for terrain checks is valid and that the expected resources (e.g., water) are present in that area. If the resource is not available, consider relocating the structure or checking other locations."}
