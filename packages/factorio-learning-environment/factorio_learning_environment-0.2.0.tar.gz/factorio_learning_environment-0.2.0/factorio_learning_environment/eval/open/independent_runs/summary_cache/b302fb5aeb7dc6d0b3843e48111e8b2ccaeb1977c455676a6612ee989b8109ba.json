{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal fuel, status: No ingredients to smelt.\n  - Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with coal fuel, status: No ingredients to smelt.\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=1.5), picking up from position (x=0.5, y=1.5) and dropping at position (x=2.5, y=1.5).\n  - Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=1.5), picking up from position (x=2.5, y=1.5) and dropping at position (x=4.5, y=1.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### NameError: Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, the variable `first_chest` was not defined before being referenced. Double-check variable names and ensure they are initialized.\n\n### Exception: No Entity Found at Specified Position\n- Verify the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting to interact with them. This error occurred when trying to access a wooden chest that was not present at the specified location.\n\n### Exception: No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate. This can be resolved by checking inventories and ensuring raw materials are available for smelting.\n\n### Exception: Could Not Insert Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are present in the inventory. This error was encountered when trying to insert iron ore without having any in the inventory.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency and reduce the occurrence of runtime issues."}
