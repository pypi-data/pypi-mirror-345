{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production (Position 0,0 and 2,0)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing iron plates:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0) with coal fuel (24) and no ingredients\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) with coal fuel (25) and no ingredients\nBoth furnaces are idle due to lack of ingredients\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position 4,4 and 6,4)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing copper plates:\n- Furnace 3 at (4,4) with coal fuel (28) and no ingredients\n- Furnace 4 at (6,4) with coal fuel (28) and no ingredients\nBoth furnaces are idle due to lack of ingredients\n\n### Power Generation System (Position -7.5, 18.5)\nComplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Steam engine at (-7.5, 18.5), working status, containing 200 steam at 165\u00b0\n- Boiler at (-7.5, 22.0), working with 4 coal, containing water (199.99) and steam (199.93)\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5), working status, containing water (99.93)\n- Connected pipe groups:\n  - Steam pipes at (-7.5, 15.5)\n  - Empty pipes at (-7.5, 20.5)\n  - Water pipes at (-8.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple poles covering areas from (-2.5,7.5) to (7.5,21.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Lab Placement Errors\n- Multiple failed attempts to place lab at different coordinates due to [processing] error\n- Ensure the target location is clear of other entities before placing lab\n- Verify you have lab in inventory before attempting to place it\n- Check if the placement area is within buildable terrain\n\n### Resource and Inventory Management\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler to prevent fuel depletion\n- Keep track of wood supply for crafting electric poles\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before crafting (especially for complex items like labs)\n\n### Entity Access Errors\n- Verify entity existence at specified coordinates before attempting to access\n- When accessing lab entity, ensure proper position coordinates are used\n- Use proper error handling when entities are not found at expected locations\n\n### Crafting Prerequisites\n- Check inventory for all required materials before starting crafting chains\n- For small electric poles, ensure sufficient wood and copper cables\n- When crafting labs, verify all components (transport belts, iron gear wheels, electronic circuits) are available\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Ensure small electric poles are available in inventory before attempting connections\n- Verify connection points are within range of existing power network\n- Keep track of power pole placement to maintain continuous network coverage"}
