{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Production Line at (-73.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron ore:\n- First stone furnace at position (3.0, -73.0)\n- Second stone furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational, containing coal as fuel and have iron plates as output. Each furnace currently has:\n- 23 coal units as fuel\n- 13 iron plates as output\nCurrently waiting for new ingredients to smelt\n\n###Copper Mining Setup at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (-21.0, -73.0) targeting copper ore deposit\nCurrently operational with 24 coal units as fuel but output is blocked due to missing output entity\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Errors when attempting to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Always check if required entity is in inventory before attempting to place it\n- Craft required entities first if they're not available in inventory\n\n###Errors when operating mining equipment without fuel\n- Ensure you have necessary fuel (coal) in inventory before attempting to insert it into mining equipment\n- Mining equipment needs fuel to operate, check fuel requirements before placing mining equipment\n\n###Errors when placing entities in invalid locations\n- Check if the target location is valid for entity placement\n- Ensure there are no items on the ground blocking the placement\n- Verify the space requirements for the entity being placed\n\n###Resource Management Tips\n- Keep track of essential resources like coal in inventory\n- Plan ahead to ensure you have all necessary materials (fuel, ingredients) before starting new construction\n- When setting up mining operations, always ensure there's a destination entity (like a chest or furnace) at the drop position before starting the mining drill"}
