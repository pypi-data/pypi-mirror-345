{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler (position -13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5)\n- Small electric poles (positions -19.5, 22.5 and -15.5, 19.5)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position -17.5, 23.5)\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting the electricity generator and offshore pump:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=33738, position -18.5, 16.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=33741, position -12.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=33742, position -8.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=33744, position -10.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=33745, position -7.5, 23.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure you are placing the small electric pole in a valid position that is not obstructed by other entities.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory\n- Correct the usage of the `inspect_inventory` function to only provide the necessary arguments. Ensure the first argument is an Entity or Position object instead of a Prototype object.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that all necessary connections are established before attempting to use the lab or other entities that require power or resources."}
