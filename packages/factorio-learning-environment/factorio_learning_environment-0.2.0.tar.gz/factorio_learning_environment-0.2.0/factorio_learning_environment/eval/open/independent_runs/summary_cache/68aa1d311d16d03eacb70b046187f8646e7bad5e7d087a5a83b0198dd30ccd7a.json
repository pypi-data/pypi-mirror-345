Reposition and align the inserter if necessary.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure you have sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel an entity. Check your inventory to confirm the availability of fuel resources.\n\n### Errors with furnace operation\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly transferring resources to the furnace."}
