{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)  \n- **Wooden chest** at position (41.5, -80.5)  \n\nThis setup is used for mining coal and storing it in the chest for further use.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in non-buildable positions\n- Ensure the target position is buildable before attempting to place entities like transport belts, burner mining drills, or wooden chests.  \n- Use the `is_buildable` check to verify the tile before placement.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into non-existent or incorrect entities\n- Verify the entity exists and is correctly referenced before inserting items like coal.  \n- Ensure the entity can accept the item being inserted (e.g., burner mining drills accept coal, but other entities may not).\n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Define variables like `transport_belt` before using them in conditional statements or operations.  \n- Initialize all variables properly to avoid `NameError` exceptions.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to get non-existent entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it using `get_entity`.  \n- Double-check the entity type and position for accuracy.\n\n#### Repeated errors in placing burner mining drills and chests\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to place entities in the same non-buildable positions.  \n- Identify alternative buildable locations nearby for placement."}
