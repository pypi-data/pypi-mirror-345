{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (x, y) [exact position not specified]\n- Steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0) [currently not found]\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x1, y1) [exact position not specified]\n- Furnace at position (y1, y2) [exact position not specified]\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (z1) [exact position not specified]\n- Inserter at position (a) that puts into assembling machine [exact position not specified]\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace to the assembling machine [exact position not specified]\n\n### Additional Structures\n- Stone furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\n- Lab at position (6.5, 1.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (8.5, 1.5)\n- Another stone furnace at position (10.0, 1.0)\n- Additional wooden chests at positions (3.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 5.5)\n- Pipe group with fluid systems [exact positions not specified]\n- Electricity group with poles [exact positions not specified]\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing small-electric-pole is clear of any blocking entities or terrain issues (e.g., water). Check the coordinates before placing.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to retrieve (e.g., steam engine) exists at the specified position. If the entity is not found, check the coordinates and ensure it has not been removed or misplaced.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities in the target tile.\n\n### Repeated Errors\n- The same errors regarding electric pole placement and steam engine retrieval have occurred multiple times. Consistently verify locations and clear any obstructions before attempting to place or retrieve entities."}
