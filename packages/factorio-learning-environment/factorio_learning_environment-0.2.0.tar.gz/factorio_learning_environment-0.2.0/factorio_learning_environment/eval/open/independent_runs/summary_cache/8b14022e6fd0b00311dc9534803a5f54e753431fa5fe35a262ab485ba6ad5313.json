{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 13) and output (iron-plate: 64).\n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 18) and output (iron-plate: 62).\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 24) and output (iron-plate: 62).\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0) with fuel (coal: 9), connected to a wooden chest at (4.5, -58.5) for iron ore collection.\n\n### Storage Chests\n- Wooden chests at various positions for storing iron plates and other resources:\n  - Position (-14.5, -50.5) to (-6.5, -50.5) with varying contents.\n  - Iron chests at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory in Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for collecting resources from drills or furnaces have enough space to accommodate incoming items. Regularly check and empty chests to prevent overflow and halt in production.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly supply furnaces with necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to maintain continuous production. Monitor the input inventory of furnaces to avoid production stoppages due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int, current count 27\n- `iron_plate`: int, current count 4208\n- `coal`: int, current count 20\n- `wood`: int, current count 10\n- `iron_gear_wheel`: int, current count 4\n\nThis report summarizes the current state of structures and provides guidance on mitigating errors observed in the recent execution steps."}
