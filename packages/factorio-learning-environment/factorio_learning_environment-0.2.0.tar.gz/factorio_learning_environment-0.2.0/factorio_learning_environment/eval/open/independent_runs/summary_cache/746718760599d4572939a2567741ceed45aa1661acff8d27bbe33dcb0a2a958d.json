{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction Structure at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator at position(-4.5, 0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5), boiler at position (-7.5, 0.0), steam engine at position (-4.5, 0.5) and a pipe group connecting them at positions [(-6.5, -2.5), (-4.5, -2.5), (-5.5, -2.5), (-6.5, -1.5)]\n\n### New Electricity Generator at position(-8.5, 11.0)\nConsists of boiler at position (-8.5, 11.0)\n\n### Power Distribution Structure\nConsists of small electric poles at various positions including (-2.5, 1.5), (13.5, 17.5), (15.5, 19.5), (18.5, 36.5), (21.5, 35.5), (15.5, 36.5), (4.5, 38.5), (15.5, 39.5), (5.5, 46.5), (9.5, 46.5) connecting the steam engine to the pumpjack, oil refinery and chemical plant\n\n### Oil Processing Structure at position(7.5, 40.5)\nConsists of oil refinery at position (7.5, 40.5) and a pipe group connecting pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) to oil refinery at positions [(11.5, 39.5), (12.5, 39.5), (12.5, 38.5), ..., (9.5, 43.5), (10.5, 43.5), (10.5, 42.5)]\n\n### Chemical Plant Structure at position(7.5, 45.5)\nConsists of chemical plant at position (7.5, 45.5) and a pipe connecting oil refinery at (7.5, 40.5) to chemical plant at positions [(8.5, 43.5), (9.5, 43.5)]\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied or unplaceable positions:\n  - Ensure the target position is clear of other entities and is not part of unplaceable terrain (such as water) before attempting to place a new entity.\n* Errors when using non-existent or misplaced entities:\n  - Verify that the entity you are trying to use or connect to exists and is correctly positioned.\n* Errors when entities are not receiving power:\n  - Ensure that the entity is connected to a power source and that the power network is functioning correctly.\n* Errors due to undefined functions or variables:\n  - Ensure that all functions and variables are defined before they are used in the code. For example, 'new_pole' is not defined.\n* Errors when connecting entities with pipes:\n  - Ensure that the connection points of the entities are not blocked and are correctly aligned.\n* Errors when using incorrect arguments for functions:\n  - Check the function documentation to ensure the correct number and types of arguments are being passed. For example, the error in Step 40 and Step 46 suggests an incorrect argument was passed to a function.\n* Errors when setting recipes for entities:\n  - Ensure that the recipe is correctly defined and is valid for the entity. For example, 'plastic-bar' should be 'RecipeName.PlasticBar' or a valid recipe string.\n* Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler:\n  - Ensure that there is a valid path for the pipe between the offshore pump and the boiler. Check that there are no obstacles blocking the connection.\n* Repeated failure to connect offshore pump to boiler:\n  - Review the connection logic to ensure it correctly handles the positioning and connection points of the entities involved.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs.
