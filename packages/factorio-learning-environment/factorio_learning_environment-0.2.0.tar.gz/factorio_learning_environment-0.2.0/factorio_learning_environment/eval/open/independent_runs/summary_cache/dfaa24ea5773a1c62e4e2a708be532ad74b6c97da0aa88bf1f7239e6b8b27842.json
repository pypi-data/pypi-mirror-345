{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) storing iron ore temporarily.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) storing iron plates.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has space for the item being inserted. If the furnace is full or the item type is incorrect, the insertion will fail.\n- Example: At step 104, the agent attempted to insert iron ore into a furnace that was already full or not ready to accept the item.\n\n#### Errors with burner mining drills running out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills to avoid interruptions in resource extraction.\n- Example: The burner mining drill at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) frequently runs out of fuel, causing delays in iron ore production.\n\n#### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to the required items. If the source chest is empty, the inserter will remain idle.\n- Example: The burner inserter at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) often waits for iron ore to be available in the chest.\n\n#### Errors with furnaces lacking ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials to avoid idle time.\n- Example: The stone furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) is idle due to a lack of iron ore.\n\n#### General tips for avoiding errors\n- Regularly monitor the status of all structures to ensure they are functioning optimally.\n- Plan resource allocation and fuel management to prevent interruptions in production."}
