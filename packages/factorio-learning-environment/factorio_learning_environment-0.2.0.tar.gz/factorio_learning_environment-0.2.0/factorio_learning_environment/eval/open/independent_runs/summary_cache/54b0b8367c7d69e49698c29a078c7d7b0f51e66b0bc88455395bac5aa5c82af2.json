{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (z1) and inserter at position (a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position (y1) to the assembling machine at position (z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure that the target position is clear before attempting to place a pipe. In this case, a pipe could not be placed at (-6.5, 24.5) because an entity already exists at that position.\n\n### Errors when connecting structures\n- Verify that all connection points are available and not overlapping before attempting to connect structures like boilers and offshore pumps.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
