{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal fuel, working status, and connected to a Stone Furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with coal fuel, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with no fuel, currently not operational, and connected to a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with no fuel and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storing various items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Ensure that operations are completed within the expected time frame to avoid timeout errors. Consider optimizing the sequence of actions or checking for potential bottlenecks in the process.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel, which causes them to stop working.\n\n### Errors Related to Ingredient Management\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply them with the required ores to maintain continuous production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as stone furnaces, wood, coal, stone, iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates."}
