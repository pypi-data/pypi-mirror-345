{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is connected to the power network but has warnings indicating it is not receiving input liquid and has no fluid present in connections. The boiler is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) which is not receiving electricity and cannot create automation-science-pack due to missing resources: copper-plate and iron-gear-wheel.\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and processing copper-ore into iron-plate.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities. The pipe groups are part of the fluid system that includes the offshore pump and the boiler.\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of multiple small electric poles providing power to various entities, including the steam engine and the assembling machine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when setting recipes for entities\n- Ensure the entity you are trying to set a recipe for is valid and exists on the map. Verify that the furnace is placed correctly and is accessible.\n\n### Errors when inserting items from inventory\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. In this case, ensure you have coal available before trying to add it to the boiler.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
