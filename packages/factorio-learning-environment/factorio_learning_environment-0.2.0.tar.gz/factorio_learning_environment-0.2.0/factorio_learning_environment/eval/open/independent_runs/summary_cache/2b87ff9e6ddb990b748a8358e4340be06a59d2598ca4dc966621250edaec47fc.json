{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -84.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing 650 units of coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing 238 units of copper ore.\n- Transport Belt system connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt, producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt system.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing 280 units of iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt system.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, producing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to wooden chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the transport system to verify that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters are correctly positioned and have access to source items. Ensure that the transport belts or chests they are drawing from contain the necessary items.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drills Output Blocked\n- Ensure that mining drills have a clear output path and that there is a sink entity (e.g., chest or transport belt) to accept the output. Remove any items blocking the output path.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt System\n- Regularly check and adjust the transport belt system to ensure that items are moving correctly between entities. Ensure that belts are connected and oriented in the correct direction."}
