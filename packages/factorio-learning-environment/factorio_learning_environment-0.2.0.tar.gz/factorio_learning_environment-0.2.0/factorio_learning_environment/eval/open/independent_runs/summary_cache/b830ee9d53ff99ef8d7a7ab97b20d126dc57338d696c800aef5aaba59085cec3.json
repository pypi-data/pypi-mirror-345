{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Pipes connecting the boiler to the steam engine, with specific pipe placements at positions such as (6.5, 27.5), (11.5, 28.5), (13.5, 28.5), (14.5, 28.5), (15.5, 28.5), and (16.5, 28.5)\n- Electricity network connected with poles at various positions, including (12.5, 34.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -82.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) and another at (41.5, -83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) with a pickup position at (53.5, -83.5) and drop position at (55.5, -83.5)\n- Additional wooden chest at position (56.5, -83.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Science Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently without power\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of:\n- Belt system transporting coal, with belts positioned from (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5) and other connected belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure the target location for placing pipes is clear of existing objects or unplaceable terrain such as water. Consider adjusting the position or clearing the area before attempting to place a pipe.\n\n### Errors with electricity network connections\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity network, such as poles and connections, are properly established to maintain a consistent power supply to all necessary structures.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move closer to the target entity from which you want to extract items before attempting the extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement by verifying that the tile is not already occupied by another entity."}
