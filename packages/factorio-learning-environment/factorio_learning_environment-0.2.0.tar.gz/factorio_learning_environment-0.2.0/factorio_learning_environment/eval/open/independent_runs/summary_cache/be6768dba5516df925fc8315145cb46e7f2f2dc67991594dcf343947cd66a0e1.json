{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position(x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to wooden chests at positions (x=52.5, y=-84.5) and (x=54.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position(x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to wooden chests at positions (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) and (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position(x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and a burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) which is linked to a wooden chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore processing and storage.\n\n### Copper Processing Facility at Positions(x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=5.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=5.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Multiple wooden chests surrounding the furnaces for copper ore storage.\n\n### Belt System for Material Transport\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=1.5, y=1.5) to (x=3.5, y=1.5) and (x=3.5, y=2.5) to (x=5.5, y=2.5) for transporting materials between processing units.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Drop Position\n- Ensure that the drop position of the inserter matches the position of the intended receiving entity (e.g., a chest) to avoid misalignment errors.\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Function Usage\n- Avoid treating objects as callable functions. Ensure that you are using the correct method or function for the intended operation, such as using `pickup_entity` correctly with the appropriate parameters.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items and that the source is not blocked or empty to prevent the inserter from waiting indefinitely.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Ensure that there is adequate space or a receiving entity for the inserter's output to prevent blockage and ensure smooth operation."}
