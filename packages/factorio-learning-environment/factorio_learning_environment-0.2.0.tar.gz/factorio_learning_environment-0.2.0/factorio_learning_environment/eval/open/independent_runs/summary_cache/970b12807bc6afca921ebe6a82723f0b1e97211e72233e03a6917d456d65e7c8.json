{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5), boiler (position -34.5, 30.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The generator is intended to produce electricity through steam generated from the boiler.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups, including:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=60902, position=-24.5, -51.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=60903, fluid=water, position=-11.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=60904, position=-2.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=61060, position=-24.5, -51.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=61062, fluid=water, position=-12.5, 24.5)\n\n### Labs\nConsists of two labs (positions not specified) that are currently not connected to power.\n\n### Furnaces\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing or connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the location where you are trying to place a pipe does not overlap with water or any other entity. Check the coordinates carefully before placing. This error has occurred multiple times at positions (-10.5, 28.5), (-36.5, 30.0), and (-34.5, 32.0).\n\n### Errors with boiler connection\n- The boiler is currently not connected. Make sure to connect it to a valid water source and ensure that the pipes are correctly placed to avoid overlapping issues. The boiler status remains NOT_CONNECTED.\n\n### Errors with electricity connection\n- The steam engine is not connected to a power network. Verify the connections of small electric poles to ensure they are correctly placed to provide power.\n\n### Errors with lab power\n- The labs are currently showing no power. Ensure that they are connected to the electricity grid and that there are sufficient power sources available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This error has occurred when attempting to place pipes at positions that are too far away.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Always verify that the tile you are attempting to place an entity on is free and not occupied by another entity."}
