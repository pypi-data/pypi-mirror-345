{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) storing iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore and copper plate\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Multiple Wooden Chests storing copper ore at various positions (e.g., (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), etc.)\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests and belts\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace and chests\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) transferring items between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using the pickup_entity function\n- Ensure that the correct entity type is being called. The 'Chest' object is not callable, indicating a misuse of the API. Verify that the function and its parameters are correctly implemented.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations. For instance, the chest at position (52.5, -84.5) is full, causing the mining drill to stop.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Keep mining drills and inserters fueled to maintain continuous operation. The drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) and (-14.0, -53.0) are out of fuel, which can halt production.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) are lacking ingredients, which prevents them from producing copper plates."}
