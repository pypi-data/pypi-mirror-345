This can be mitigated by simplifying the code and logic, or by increasing the allowed execution time.\n\n### Errors when using get_entities\n- The agent is running into errors when using get_entities. This can be mitigated by ensuring that the agent is connected to the game and that the game is running.\n\nNAMESPACE\n- No new functions have been defined.\n- Important variables:\n  - player: Entity\n  - stone: Entity\n```"}
