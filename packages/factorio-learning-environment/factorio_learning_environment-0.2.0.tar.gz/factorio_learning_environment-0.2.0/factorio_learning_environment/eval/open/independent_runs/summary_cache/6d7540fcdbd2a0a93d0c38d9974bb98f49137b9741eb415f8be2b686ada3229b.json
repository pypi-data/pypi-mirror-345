{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Warning: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Contains iron ore (10 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Warning: Out of fuel\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (15 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient fuel\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces.\n\n### Errors when the chest is full\n- Regularly check and clear the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent the drill from stopping due to a full chest.\n\n### Errors when inserters are out of fuel\n- Make sure inserters are refueled timely to maintain continuous operation in transferring items between entities.\n\n### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has a continuous supply of raw materials (iron ore) to maintain production of iron plates."}
