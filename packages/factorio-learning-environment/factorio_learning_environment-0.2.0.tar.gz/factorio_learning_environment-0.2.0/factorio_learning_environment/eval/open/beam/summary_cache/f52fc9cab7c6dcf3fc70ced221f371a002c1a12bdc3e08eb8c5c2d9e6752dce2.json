{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has once again not resulted in the expected outcome:\n\n### New Active Furnace Status:\n- The furnace now contains **3 pieces of stone**, indicating that the attempt to load stone was only partially successful.\n- The status of the furnace is still **\"WORKING\"**, but it is not processing the Copper Ore.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the new one)\n  - 9 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace currently lacks sufficient stone to fully initiate smelting for the Copper Ore. \n- It may be retaining state information from previous operations, impacting its ability to accept and process new materials correctly.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Remaining Stone**: I will extract the current stone from the active furnace to reset it.\n2. **Reinsert Required Materials**: After extraction, I will attempt to insert **5 pieces of stone** and **1 piece of Copper Ore** back into the furnace.\n3. **Verify Processing Activation**: Finally, I will check whether the furnace begins its smelting operation after loading the materials.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the current materials from the active furnace, specifically the stone. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Attempt to extract the current pieces of stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, new_active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Attempting to extract current pieces of stone\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nnew_active_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"New Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {new_active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-408]"}
