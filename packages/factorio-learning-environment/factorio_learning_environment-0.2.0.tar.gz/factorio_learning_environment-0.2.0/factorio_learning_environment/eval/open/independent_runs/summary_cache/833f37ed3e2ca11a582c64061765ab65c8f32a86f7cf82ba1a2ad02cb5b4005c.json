{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. In multiple steps the agent attempted to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but all such attempts failed. No operational building or connected assembly of entities is present as a result of these actions.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors \u2013 Calls to get_entities() have been made incorrectly. In one case a keyword ('radius') was passed unexpectedly, and in another call extra positional arguments were provided. Verify the function\u2019s signature and adjust the call to use only the accepted parameters.\n\u2022 NoneType Handling \u2013 Iteration over the result of get_entities() led to a TypeError when a None value was returned. Always check that the fetched entity list is not None (or substitute an empty list) before iterating.\n\u2022 Lab Placement Issues \u2013 Repeated failures to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) are due to the Lab not being present in inventory. Ensure that a Lab is available (or successfully crafted) before attempting its placement.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Shortages \u2013 Attempts to craft a Lab have failed because required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) were missing. Verify that the production chain is supplying all necessary components in sufficient quantities before initiating Lab crafting."}
