"""aztec_tool.enums
==================

Enum helpers used across *aztec-tool*.

The module defines three small enumerations:

* **ReadingDirection** - internal state-machine for the data spiral walk
* **AztecType** - compact vs full symbols
* **AztecTableType** - character tables used by the high-level decoder
