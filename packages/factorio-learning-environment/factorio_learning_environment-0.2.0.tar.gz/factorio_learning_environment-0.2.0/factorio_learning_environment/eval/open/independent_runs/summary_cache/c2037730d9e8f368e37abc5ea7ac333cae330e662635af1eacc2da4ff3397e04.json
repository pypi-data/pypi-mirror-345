Double-check the position and the type of entity before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters with Blocked Outputs\n- Make sure there is a valid destination for the inserter's output. Check for any items blocking the path or ensure there is a sink entity to accept the output.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity has the required items for the inserter to operate. Ensure that the source is correctly connected and stocked with items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Check the tile for any existing entities that might obstruct placement."}
