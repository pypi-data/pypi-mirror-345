{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace 1 at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n- Stone Furnace 2 at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) transferring items between furnaces and wooden chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belts connecting furnaces and chests for item movement.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-7.0, y=23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5).\n- Boiler at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5) fueled by coal.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) supplying water.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items.\n- Transport Belts for moving mined iron ore to furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters without source items\n- Ensure that the source entity for inserters has items available for transfer to avoid idle inserters.\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in your inventory to prevent operation failures.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accept items from inserters to avoid blocking the production line.\n\n### Errors due to inserters being out of fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner inserters to maintain continuous operation and avoid production halts."}
