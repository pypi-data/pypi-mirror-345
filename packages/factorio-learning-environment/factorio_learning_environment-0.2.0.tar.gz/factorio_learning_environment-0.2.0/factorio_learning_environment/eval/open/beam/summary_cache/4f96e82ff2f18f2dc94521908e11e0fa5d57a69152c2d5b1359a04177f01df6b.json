{"content": "The error suggests that the `boiler` variable is not defined in the current scope. This might be due to a previous failure in placing the boiler or an oversight in variable assignment. Let's ensure the boiler is placed correctly and then proceed with the setup.\n\n### Steps to Correct the Setup:\n\n1. **Place the Boiler:**\n   - Ensure the boiler is placed correctly next to the offshore pump. If it hasn't been placed, do so now.\n\n2. **Place the Steam Engine:**\n   - Calculate the position for the steam engine relative to the boiler.\n\n3. **Connect the Power:**\n   - Use small electric poles to connect the steam engine to the assembling machine.\n\n### Code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Place the Boiler if not already placed\nboiler_position = Position(x=offshore_pump.position.x, y=offshore_pump.position.y - 2)\n\ntry:\n    boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position, direction=Direction.DOWN)\n    print(f\"Boiler placed at {boiler_position}.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Boiler placement error: {str(e)}\")\n\n# Step 2: Place the Steam Engine\nsteam_engine_position = Position(x=boiler_position.x, y=boiler_position.y - 2)\n\ntry:\n    steam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=steam_engine_position, direction=Direction.DOWN)\n    print(f\"Steam engine placed at {steam_engine_position}.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Steam engine placement error: {str(e)}\")\n\n# Step 3: Connect the Power\nsmall_poles = get_entities(entities={Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n\nif small_poles:\n    try:\n        for pole in small_poles:\n            if pole.energy == 0.0:  # Not transmitting power\n                connect_entities(steam_engine_position, pole.position)\n                connect_entities(pole.position, assembling_machine_position)\n        print(\"Connected poles to power grid.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Pole connection error: {str(e)}\")\n\n# Step 4: Verify Fuel Supply for the Boiler\nboiler_status = inspect_inventory(boiler)\ncoal_needed = 5 - boiler_status.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\nif coal_needed > 0:\n    move_to(nearest(Resource.Coal))\n    harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Coal), coal_needed)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, coal_needed)\n\n# Step 5: Ensure Assembling Machine Has Copper Plates\nif inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0) > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, assembling_machine_position, 1)\n\n# Step 6: Check Overall System State\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Inventory after adjustments: {final_inventory}\")\nupdated_entities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Updated entities on the map: {updated_entities}\")\n```\n\n### Summary:\n- Ensure the boiler and steam engine are placed correctly.\n- Use electric poles to connect the power system to the assembling machine.\n- Verify that the boiler has enough fuel and the assembling machine has the necessary resources.", "summary_range": "[1-146]"}
