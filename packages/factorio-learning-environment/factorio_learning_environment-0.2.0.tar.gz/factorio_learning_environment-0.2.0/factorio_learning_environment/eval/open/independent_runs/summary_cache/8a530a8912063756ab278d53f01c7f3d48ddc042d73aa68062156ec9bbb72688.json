{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0), extracting resources and connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5), storing coal and other resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5), transferring items from the chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5).\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5) and (x=1.5, y=0.5), storing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Belt Group** connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of coal across the facility.\n- **Belts** at positions (x=43.5, y=-84.5) to (x=45.5, y=-84.5) and (x=45.5, y=-85.5) to (x=47.5, y=-85.5), transporting coal to necessary locations.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure to manage inventory space effectively by transferring excess items to chests to avoid full inventory errors. This will prevent failed harvesting attempts due to lack of space.\n\n### Resource Insertion Errors\n- Before attempting to insert resources into a furnace or other entities, verify that the required resources are available in the inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Extraction and Transfer Errors\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining interruptions due to full chests. This will ensure continuous resource extraction and processing.\n\n### Resource Harvesting Errors\n- When harvesting resources, ensure there is sufficient space in the inventory to accommodate the harvested quantity to avoid failed harvesting attempts."}
