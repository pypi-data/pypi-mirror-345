{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace positioned at (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore by consuming coal and ore. This structure remains unchanged from previous reports.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Resource Retrieval Errors near Target Structures\n- Verify that the target location contains the required resource before attempting retrieval. If get_resource_patch returns an error (e.g., \u201cNo resource of type coal at the specified location\u201d), ensure to adjust the retrieval coordinates or confirm the presence of the resource patch first.\n  \n### Insufficient Fuel during Insertion\n- Check inventory for the required fuel (e.g., coal) before attempting insertion into a furnace to ensure uninterrupted smelting cycles.\n- Verify resource availability to avoid errors due to missing items.\n\n### Insufficient Production and Process Delays in Smelting\n- When the furnace produces fewer iron plates than expected, ensure that both fuel and ore are supplied adequately. Boost smelting by adding extra fuel (e.g., coal) when production is lagging.\n- Adjust production intervals to allow the furnace to complete its smelting cycle and monitor status warnings to prevent process timeouts."}
