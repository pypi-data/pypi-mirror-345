This conversion is critical for later attempts to craft lab components.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the furnace entity at Position(-27.0, -60.0) used for converting copper ore (harvested from a nearby patch at Position(-28.5, -61.5)) with coal into copper plates. The copper plates produced feed into the copper cable production needed for lab crafting.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n- Errors in get_entities() usage:\n  \u2022 Avoid passing unsupported parameters \u2013 one call used a keyword argument 'radius' while another passed three positional arguments even though the function takes none. Always verify the function\u2019s signature before invoking it.\n\n- Lab placement and iterable validation issues:\n  \u2022 Attempts to place a Lab failed because the required lab item was not in the inventory. Before placement, confirm that the entity exists in the inventory.\n  \u2022 Iterating over the result of get_entities without checking for a None value produced a TypeError. Ensure that when a function may return None, a fallback (such as an empty list) is used.\n\n- Lab crafting resource shortages:\n  \u2022 Lab crafting repeatedly failed due to missing sub-ingredients. One error indicated insufficient iron plates (needed to craft iron-gear-wheels) while another showed a shortage in copper-based components (copper plates needed for copper-cable, which in turn affect electronic-circuit production).\n  \u2022 To mitigate these issues, verify that all base resources and intermediate products are available and that the proper smelting or crafting facilities (such as the furnaces) are actively producing the needed items before initiating lab crafting."}
