{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) (drop position for mined iron ore)\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (5.5, -60.5) (additional storage)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0) currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of multiple **Wooden Chests** for storage purposes:\n- Chest at position (7.5, -60.5)\n- Chest at position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Chest at position (9.5, -60.5)\n- Chest at position (8.5, -60.5)\n- Chest at position (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Overflow Management\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position for the burner mining drill is regularly emptied to prevent mining stoppages. The current chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, which halts mining operations.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Management\n- Regularly supply the furnaces with ingredients to maintain continuous operation. The furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) is inactive due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
