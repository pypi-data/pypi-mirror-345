{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0) to (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) and Furnace at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -47.5) connecting both furnaces\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -46.5) for storing output\n- Transport Belt network connecting furnaces to the chest\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -44.5) storing iron plates\n- Iron Chest at Position (-11.5, -44.5) for additional storage\n- Transport Belt network from Position (-14.5, -45.5) to (-11.5, -44.5) for distribution\n- Multiple Burner Inserters facilitating movement between chests and belts\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network from Position (-8.5, 21.5) to (-9.5, 23.5) for water supply\n- Electricity network with poles distributed across various positions\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of items to move. Check the source inventory and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to maintain continuous energy production. Consider automating fuel supply to the boiler.\n\n### Lab with No Research in Progress\n- Assign research tasks to the lab to ensure continuous technological advancement."}
