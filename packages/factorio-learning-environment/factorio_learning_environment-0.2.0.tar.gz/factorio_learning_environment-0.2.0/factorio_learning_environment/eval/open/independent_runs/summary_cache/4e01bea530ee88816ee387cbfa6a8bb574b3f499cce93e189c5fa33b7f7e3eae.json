{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-6.0, 1.5) (contains 5 coal)\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 4.5)\n- Connected with pipes at (-8.5, -0.5), (-6.5, -0.5), (-7.5, -0.5), (-4.5, 1.5), (-4.5, 2.5), (-4.5, 3.5), (-4.5, 4.5)\n\n### Iron Production Facility at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore (status: WORKING)\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 72.5) containing 9 iron ore\n- Inserter at (16.5, 72.5) moving ore from chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (18.0, 73.0) (status: NO_FUEL, contains 13 iron ore)\n- Assembling machine 2 at (21.5, 74.5) set to produce iron gear wheels\n- Connected with small electric poles throughout the area\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement distance errors\n- Must move within 10 tiles of target position before placing entities (occurred 3 times)\n- When working with distant factories, first navigate to the location before attempting modifications\n\n### Furnace system issues\n- Furnaces require fuel (coal) to operate - ensure fuel is added (current furnace at (18.0, 73.0) has no fuel)\n- Output inserters must be placed on the opposite side from input inserters\n- Ensure proper spacing between furnace and output inserter (1 tile gap recommended)\n\n### Resource patch access errors\n- When accessing resource patches, use correct attributes (position instead of center)\n- Verify mining drill output area is clear before operation (drill was WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION)\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Verify power connection for all inserters before attempting belt connections\n- Ensure all electrical entities are within range of electric poles\n\n### Transport belt connection errors\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly from furnaces - must use an inserter as intermediary\n- When placing output inserters for furnaces, ensure they have clear drop positions not blocked by other entities\n\n### List attribute errors\n- When working with lists of entities, ensure proper attribute access (list has no position attribute)"}
