This script provides a command-line interface function, `cli_view_issue`, to retrieve and display information
about a specific Jira issue using a given Jira client object. It processes custom fields by replacing their keys with
corresponding names and formats the output for improved readability.

Key Features:
- The `cli_view_issue` function accepts a Jira client and a namespace of arguments, specifically the issue key to be
viewed.
- It handles various data types for issue fields, including dictionaries, lists, and multiline strings, ensuring a
user-friendly display.
- The function includes error handling for potential issues encountered while accessing Jira.

Exceptions:
- Raises `ViewIssueError` if there are issues with accessing or viewing the specified issue.

Note:
- The output is formatted in a table-like structure, displaying only the allowed keys for clarity.
