{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (-39.5, -116.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper plates in inventory\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with iron plates in inventory\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups spanning various positions, including:\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 10.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 23.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-5.5, 24.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles spanning multiple positions, including:\n  - Pole at Position (-0.5, 16.5)\n  - Pole at Position (-1.5, 17.5)\n  - Pole at Position (1.5, 16.5)\n  - Pole at Position (13.5, -16.5)\n  - Pole at Position (14.5, -17.5)\n  - Pole at Position (7.5, -15.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Boiler Connection Errors\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to a water source. Check that pipes are correctly placed and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler.\n\n### Pipe Placement Errors\n- Verify the presence and correct placement of pipes at positions where they are expected, such as (-47.5, -122.5) and (-46.5, -122.5). Ensure pipes are not missing or misplaced.\n\n### Power Connection Errors\n- Ensure all electrical entities like inserters and labs are connected to a powered electric pole network to avoid \"not receiving electricity\" warnings."}
