{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine at position -21.5, 25.5.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the second argument of the `insert_item` function is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Verify that you are referencing the correct entity when attempting to add items.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure that the positions you are trying to connect with pipes are valid and that the entities at those positions can be connected. Check for any obstacles or incorrect positioning that may prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target tile that may block placement."}
