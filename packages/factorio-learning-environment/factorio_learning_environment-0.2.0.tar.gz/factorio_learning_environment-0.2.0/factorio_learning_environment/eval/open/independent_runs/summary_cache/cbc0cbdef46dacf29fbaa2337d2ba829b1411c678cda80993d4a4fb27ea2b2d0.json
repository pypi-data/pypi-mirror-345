Ensure the active fluid_system ([34852]) associated with the boiler and offshore pump is used consistently for water supply.\n- Inflexible Pipeline Stabilization Strategy:\n  \u2022 The fixed 10-second wait period for pipeline stabilization causes unnecessary delays. Implement dynamic connectivity checks to proceed once stabilization is confirmed."}
