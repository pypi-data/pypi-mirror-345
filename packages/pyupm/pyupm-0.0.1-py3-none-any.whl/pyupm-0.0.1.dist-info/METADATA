UPM-Spatial-Interpolation
Python code and example data for Uncertainty Projected Mapping (UPM) as a spatial interpolation tool

The main code to generate UPM is UPM.py

There is also a simple flowchart (How to use the codes?.pdf) on how to use the codes. Please also find a file named The UPM story.pdf, which I created to provide an easy recap of UPM.
