{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Smelting Setup at Position (43.0, -79.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at (43.0, -79.0): Used for smelting iron ore.\n- **Coal Inserter** at (44.5, -78.5): Feeds coal into the furnace.\n- **Ore Inserter** at (43.5, -80.5): Feeds iron ore into the furnace.\n- **Output Chest** at (43.5, -76.5): Stores smelted iron plates.\n- **Output Inserter** at (43.5, -77.5): Moves iron plates from the furnace to the output chest.\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at (41.0, -86.0): Mines coal.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at (43.0, -86.0): Mines coal.\n- **Transport Belts**:\n  - Belt at (41.5, -84.5) to (41.5, -83.5): Transports coal.\n  - Belt at (42.5, -84.5) to (42.5, -83.5): Transports coal.\n  - Belt at (43.5, -84.5) to (43.5, -83.5): Transports coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at (41.5, -83.5): Moves coal from the belt to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (41.5, -82.5): Stores coal.\n\n#### Additional Structures\n- **Wooden Chest** at (41.5, -79.5): Empty storage.\n- **Stone Furnace** at (-13.0, -50.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors Related to Entity Placement\n1. **Placing entities too far away**:\n   - Ensure the player is within 10 tiles of the target position before placing entities like furnaces, chests, or belts.\n   - Example: Attempted to place a stone furnace at (41.0, -80.0) while the player was at (61.5, -54.5).\n\n2. **Placing entities in occupied tiles**:\n   - Check for existing entities at the target position before placing new ones.\n   - Example: Attempted to place a burner inserter next to a furnace at (43.0, -79.0), but a wooden chest was already present.\n\n3. **Insufficient inventory for crafting or placing**:\n   - Ensure the required items (e.g., stone for furnaces, wood for chests) are in the inventory before crafting or placing entities.\n   - Example: Attempted to craft a stone furnace without having stone in the inventory.\n\n#### Errors Related to Extraction and Inventory\n1. **Extracting items from invalid entities**:\n   - Ensure the target entity (e.g., transport belt) contains the desired item before attempting extraction.\n   - Example: Attempted to extract coal from a transport belt at (43.5, -84.5) that did not contain coal.\n\n2. **Blocked transport belts**:\n   - Clear blocked belts by placing inserters to drain items or removing the blockage.\n   - Example: A transport belt at (43.5, -84.5) was blocked, preventing mining drills from dropping coal.\n\n#### Errors Related to Crafting\n1. **Missing raw resources for crafting**:\n   - Gather raw resources (e.g., stone, wood) before attempting to craft items that require them.\n   - Example: Attempted to craft a wooden chest without having wood in the inventory.\n\n#### Errors Related to Entity Status\n1. **Inspect inventory errors**:\n   - Ensure the entity being inspected (e.g., transport belt) is valid and accessible.\n   - Example: Attempted to inspect the inventory of a transport belt at (43.5, -84.5) but encountered a nil value error.\n\n#### General Tips\n- Always check the player's position relative to the target entity before performing actions.\n- Verify the inventory for required items before crafting or placing entities.\n- Monitor entity statuses (e.g., blocked belts, waiting for items) to ensure smooth operation."}
