{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (x=42.0, y=-84.0) and (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-84.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-85.5) for coal collection.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for coal collection.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) and (x=5.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) and (x=5.0, y=-60.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup at Position (x=0.5, y=18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=0.5, y=18.5) for generating electricity.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-11.5, y=26.5) intended to supply water but currently not connected.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups across various positions, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=3.5) with 301 pipes.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-23.5, y=9.5) with 3 pipes.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=11.5) with 10 pipes.\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions, each with a different number of pipes.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of multiple ElectricityGroups with poles at various positions, including:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-42.5).\n- Additional ElectricityGroups with poles at various positions.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place pipes.\n- Check for existing objects at the target location that may obstruct pipe placement.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place them, such as pipes.\n\n### Code Errors\n- Ensure that all variables and classes are correctly defined and imported. For example, the `PipeGroup` class should be defined or correctly referenced.\n- Be cautious of attribute errors, such as attempting to access undefined attributes on objects.\n\n### Connection Issues\n- Ensure that all entities, such as the Offshore Pump and Steam Engine, are properly connected to their respective networks to avoid warnings like \"No fluid present in connections.\"\n\nBy addressing these errors and following the tips provided, the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations can be significantly improved."}
