{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine:\n  - PipeGroup (steam) connecting various positions including (x=9.5, y=15.5) to (x=17.5, y=15.5)\n  - PipeGroup (water) from offshore pump at (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to boiler at (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=33.5, y=24.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), and (x=21.5, y=27.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the connection path is clear and that all entities involved in the connection are correctly positioned and compatible. Check the alignment and type of pipes and underground pipes being used.\n\n### Errors in Refueling Boiler\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to ensure continuous operation of the boiler. Regularly check the fuel levels and refuel before depletion.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Boiler Fuel\n- Implement checks to verify fuel levels before attempting operations that require fuel. This will prevent assertion errors related to fuel shortages.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect two positions using specified prototypes. Ensure that the path is valid and entities are compatible.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of connected entities between specified positions.\n- `boiler_fuel_inventory`: Inventory object tracking fuel levels in the boiler. Ensure it is updated with current fuel levels to avoid errors."}
