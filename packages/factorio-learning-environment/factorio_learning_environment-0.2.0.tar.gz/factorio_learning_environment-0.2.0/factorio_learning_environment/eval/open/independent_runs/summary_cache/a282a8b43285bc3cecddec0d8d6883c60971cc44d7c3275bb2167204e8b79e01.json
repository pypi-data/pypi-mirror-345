{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-14.5, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-14.5, 20.0)\n- Boiler at position (-11.5, 20.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-4.5, 22.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 22.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n- Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Multiple Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), (-14.5, -43.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5), (-9.5, -43.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Belt Group connecting various components\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that the path between the offshore pump and the boiler is clear and that there are no blockages preventing the connection of pipes.\n\n### Errors Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Verify that there are no entities blocking the path between the boiler and the steam engine. Ensure that the pipes can be placed without obstruction.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that items are being transported correctly.\n\n### Furnace Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces are supplied with the required ingredients for smelting. Verify that the input belts or inserters are functioning and delivering the necessary materials.\n\n### General Placement and Connection Errors\n- Always verify that there is enough space and no obstructions before placing entities or attempting connections between them. Ensure that all necessary components are in place and correctly aligned."}
