{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Ore Smelting Facility at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (41.0, -82.0), a burner mining drill at position (43.0, -82.0), a burner inserter at position (43.5, -80.5), and three wooden chests at positions (44.5, -81.5), (45.5, -80.5), and (43.5, -79.5). The stone furnace is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The burner mining drill is used for mining coal or other resources. The burner inserter is used to insert items into the furnace or chests. The wooden chests are used for storing items.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when crafting items with missing sub-ingredients\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on unplaceable terrain\n- Avoid placing entities on water or other unplaceable terrain.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities with no available space\n- Ensure that the entity has available space before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors when crafting items with blocked output\n- Ensure that the entity has a clear path to output its products before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Errors when crafting items with missing raw resources\n- Gather the required raw resources before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with blocked output\n- Ensure that the entity has a clear path to output its products before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities with no items to insert\n- Ensure that you have the items to insert before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with no items in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient quantity\n- Ensure that you have sufficient quantity of items to insert before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n\n### Errors when drill output is blocked by items on the ground\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output of the drill, or clear the items on the ground that are blocking the output.\n\n### Errors when furnace has no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that the furnace has the required ingredients to smelt before attempting to smelt items."}
