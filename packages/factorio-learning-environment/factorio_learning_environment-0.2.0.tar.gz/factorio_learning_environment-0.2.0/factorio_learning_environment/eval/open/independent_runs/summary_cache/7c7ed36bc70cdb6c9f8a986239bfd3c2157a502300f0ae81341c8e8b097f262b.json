{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed for the extraction and smelting of iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore and is fueled by coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) used for temporary storage of extracted resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for storing finished iron plates and excess iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which moves iron plates from the furnace to the storage chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a mining drill without coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors When Inserters Are Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entities for inserters have the required items available to be moved. Inserters will wait indefinitely if the source is empty, leading to inefficiencies in the production line.\n\n### Errors When Furnaces Have No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Regularly check that furnaces have a sufficient supply of raw materials to maintain continuous production. This can be achieved by ensuring that inserters are functioning correctly and that there is a steady supply of ore."}
