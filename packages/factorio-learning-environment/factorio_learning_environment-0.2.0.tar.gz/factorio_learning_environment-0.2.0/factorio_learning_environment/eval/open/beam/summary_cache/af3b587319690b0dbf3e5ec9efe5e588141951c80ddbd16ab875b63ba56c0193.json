{"content": "I see the issue - there's already a stone furnace at that position. Let's analyze what we have and try to expand in a different direction.\n\n```python\n# First, let's see what entities are around us\nentities = get_entities(position=Position(x=0, y=0), radius=10)\nprint(f\"Current entities around us: {entities}\")\n\n# Try to place new furnace north of existing setup\nfurnace2 = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace, \n    reference_position=Position(x=0, y=0),\n    direction=Direction.NORTH,\n    spacing=2  # Increased spacing to avoid collision\n)\nprint(f\"Placed second furnace at: {furnace2.position}\")\n\n# Connect with transport belt\nbelt = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.TransportBelt,\n    reference_position=furnace2.position,\n    direction=Direction.SOUTH,\n    spacing=1\n)\nprint(f\"Placed transport belt at: {belt.position}\")\n\n# Add resources to new furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace2, quantity=5)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace2, quantity=10)\nprint(\"Added resources to second furnace\")\n\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Check status of both furnaces\nprint(f\"Second furnace status: {furnace2.status}\")\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. First checks what entities are already present\n2. Places new furnace in a different direction (NORTH)\n3. Uses increased spacing to avoid collisions\n4. Adds resources to the new furnace\n5. Checks status\n\nLet me know if this works better, and we can continue expanding the setup in working directions.", "summary_range": "[1-2538]"}
