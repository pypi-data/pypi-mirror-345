{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) connected to a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) transferring items from the Wooden Chest to a Stone Furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Additional Stone Furnaces at Positions (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) for further smelting capacity.\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (x=-12.5, y=-49.5) and (x=-9.5, y=-49.5) for storage of iron ore.\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Coal and Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=41.5, y=-80.5) connected to an Iron Chest.\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) containing coal.\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (x=40.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), and (x=43.5, y=-80.5) for transferring items between chests and a Stone Furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Additional Iron Chest at Position (x=45.5, y=-80.5) for storage.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (x=41.5, y=-78.5) and (x=41.5, y=-77.5) for moving items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Extracting Resources\n- Ensure proximity to the target entity before attempting to extract resources. The agent frequently failed to extract coal and iron-ore from chests due to being too far or incorrect positioning.\n\n### Errors When Transferring Items to Furnaces\n- Verify that the target furnace is accessible and has the necessary input slots available before attempting to transfer items. The agent repeatedly failed to transfer iron ore to furnaces due to extraction issues.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. The agent's inserters often waited for source items, indicating a lack of available resources or incorrect setup.\n\n### Full Chests Blocking Mining Operations\n- Regularly check and empty chests at mining drill drop positions to prevent mining operations from being halted due to full chests. The agent's mining drills were unable to continue mining because the chests were full."}
