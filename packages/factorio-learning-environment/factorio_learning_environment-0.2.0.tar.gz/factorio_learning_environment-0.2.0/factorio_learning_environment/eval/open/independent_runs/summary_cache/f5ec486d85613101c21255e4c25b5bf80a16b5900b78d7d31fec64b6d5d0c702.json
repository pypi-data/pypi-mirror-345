{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a status of 'out of fuel'.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status 'working'.\n\nConnected Entities:\n- Pipe to Ground at position (x=16.5, y=17.5).\n- Pipe at position (x=17.5, y=17.5).\n- Pipe network connecting various positions to facilitate fluid movement.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=14595) at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) with status 'empty'.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=14606) at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status 'full output', carrying water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 27325, consisting of poles at various positions (e.g., x=35.5, y=20.5; x=12.5, y=23.5; x=24.5, y=22.5) with voltage 0.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect (e.g., boiler to steam engine) are compatible and properly aligned. Check the positions and connection points before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure that all necessary resources (e.g., fuel for the boiler) are available and properly allocated to avoid operational interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Verify that fluid systems are correctly set up with appropriate input and output connections. Ensure that there are no blockages or missing connections that could prevent fluid flow.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect specified entities with pipes. Failed due to incompatible or misaligned entities.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: List of connected pipes, type: List[Entity].\n  - `boiler`: Entity representing the boiler, type: Entity.\n  - `steam_engine`: Entity representing the steam engine, type: Entity.\n  - `offshore_pump`: Entity representing the offshore pump, type: Entity."}
