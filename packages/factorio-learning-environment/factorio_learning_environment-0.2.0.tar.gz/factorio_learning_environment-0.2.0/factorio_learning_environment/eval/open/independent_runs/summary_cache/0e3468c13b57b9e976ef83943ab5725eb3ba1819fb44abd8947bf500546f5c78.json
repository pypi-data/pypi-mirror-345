{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a transport belt network and a wooden chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and another at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Transport belt network connecting the mining drill to the furnaces and chests.\n\n### Copper Ore Collection Site\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a transport belt network and a wooden chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) for ore collection.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transferring items from the furnace to the chest.\n- Transport belt network facilitating the movement of items between entities.\n\n### Coal Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple belt groups facilitating the movement of materials across various production sites, including:\n- BeltGroup from (x=-25.5, y=-70.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-65.5) facilitating ore movement.\n- BeltGroup from (x=-17.5, y=-62.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) facilitating item transfer between production sites.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items by checking the connected belts or chests for inventory.\n\n### AttributeError: 'BeltGroup' object has no attribute 'direction'\n- When accessing attributes of belt groups, ensure you are referencing valid attributes. Belt groups may not have a 'direction' attribute, so verify the correct usage of API attributes.\n\n### Errors Due to Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner entities like mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Refuel them as necessary to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt by checking the connected supply lines and inventory levels."}
