{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, -73.0) with 36 units of coal as fuel. It is currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with 10 units of coal as fuel. It is currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt. The furnace has produced 14 copper plates.\n\n### Lab at position (1.5, -68.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab at position (1.5, -68.5) connected to a power source but still lacks power. It is set up for research in automation.\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-45.5, -124.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-45.5, -124.5) connected to the boiler.\n- Boiler at position (-43.5, -123.0) with coal as fuel and connected to the offshore pump. It is now operational and producing steam.\n- Pipe group connecting the offshore pump and the boiler, consisting of pipes at positions (-45.5, -123.5) and (-45.5, -122.5).\n\n### Steam Engine at position (-39.5, -122.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Steam engine at position (-39.5, -122.5) placed next to the boiler but not operational due to connection issues with the power network and lack of input liquid.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at positions (1.5, -70.5), (4.5, -71.5), (6.5, -69.5), (5.5, -72.5), and (3.5, -68.5) with no voltage. This setup is intended to provide power but currently lacks connectivity to the lab.\n\n### Additional Pipe Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipe group at position (-43.5, -124.5) connecting the boiler to the steam engine, consisting of pipes at positions (-43.5, -124.5), (-42.5, -124.5), and (-42.5, -125.5).\n\n### Additional Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at positions (-39.5, -120.5), (-34.5, -117.5), (-32.5, -115.5), and (-36.5, -119.5) with no voltage. This setup is intended to connect the steam engine to the power network but is currently not operational.\n\n### New Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at positions (-29.5, -126.5), (-35.5, -128.5), (-27.5, -124.5), (-39.5, -124.5), (-38.5, -127.5), and (-31.5, -128.5) with no voltage. This setup is intended to connect various entities but is currently not operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace at position (4.5, -73.5) failed because there was no stone furnace in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all necessary materials before crafting an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, but the inventory had 0 stones, leading to an AssertionError. Always check material requirements against your current inventory.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect fuel insertion\n- Ensure that the correct amount of fuel is inserted into entities. An AssertionError occurred because the expected amount of coal to be inserted was 10, but the insertion did not meet the expected condition. Double-check the fuel requirements and insertion logic to avoid such errors. In step 6, an error was noted due to 0 coal being in the furnace when 10 was expected. Ensure accurate fuel management to prevent such discrepancies.\n- In step 16, an error occurred when attempting to insert coal into a furnace due to a lack of coal in the inventory. Always verify that you have the necessary fuel before attempting to insert it into a furnace.\n- In step 58, an error occurred due to attempting to insert coal into a boiler without having coal in the inventory. Ensure you have sufficient coal before attempting to refuel boilers or other entities.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.
