{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll create a report summarizing the existing structures and error tips.\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron/Copper Ore Processing Station at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61)\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5) containing iron and copper ore\n- Input inserter at (-26.5, -59.5) connecting chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -58)\n- Output inserter at (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in a row:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10, -59)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8, -59)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6, -59)\nConnected to:\n- Storage chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple inserters for material movement\n- Transport belt system connecting the components\n\n### Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nFour parallel smelting units, each consisting of:\n- Input chest at (x.5, -2.5) where x = 0,2,4,6\n- Input inserter at (x.5, -1.5)\n- Stone furnace at (x.0, 0.0)\n- Output inserter at (x.5, 1.5)\n- Output chest at (x.5, 2.5) containing iron plates\nAll units are connected by transport belts for material flow\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Placement Issues\n- Ensure inserters are placed with correct orientation between source and destination entities\n- Check that inserters have a valid pickup and drop-off position before placement\n\n### Entity Fuel Management\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - ensure consistent fuel supply to all burner entities\n- Keep coal supplied to all burner inserters and furnaces to maintain operation\n\n### Material Flow Issues\n- Several inserters are waiting for source items - ensure proper material flow through the production chain\n- Check that transport belts are properly connected and oriented to move materials in the intended direction\n\n### Space Management\n- Some inserters are blocked by items on the ground - ensure proper clearance and valid destination entities for inserter outputs\n- Verify that all entities in a production chain have proper spacing for inserter operation"}
