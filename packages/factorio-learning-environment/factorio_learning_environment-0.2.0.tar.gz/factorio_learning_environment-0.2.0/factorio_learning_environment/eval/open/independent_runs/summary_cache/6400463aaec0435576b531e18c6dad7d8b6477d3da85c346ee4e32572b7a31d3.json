{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe groups connecting various positions: \n  - (-46.5, -122.5)\n  - (-36.5, -123.5)\n  - (-48.5, -112.5)\n  - (-37.5, -111.5)\n  - (-42.5, -109.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -76.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Laboratory Setup at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (6.5, -57.5)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Stone furnaces at positions (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden chests at positions (6.5, -59.5) and (-15.5, -77.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Boiler Placement\n- Ensure the area is clear and suitable for placing a boiler. Manual intervention may be required to find a suitable position.\n\n### Connection Failures Between Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine\n- Check for placement blockages and ensure pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n- Make sure there is a clear path for pipes to connect without obstruction.\n\n### Refueling Boiler Issues\n- Ensure there is a nearby entity capable of accepting coal for refueling. Verify the proximity and accessibility of coal to the boiler."}
