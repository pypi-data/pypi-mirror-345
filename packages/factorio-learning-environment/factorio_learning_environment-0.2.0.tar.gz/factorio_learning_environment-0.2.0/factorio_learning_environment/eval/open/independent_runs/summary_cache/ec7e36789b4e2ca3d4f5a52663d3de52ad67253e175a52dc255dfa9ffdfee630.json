{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\nConsists of the following interconnected production components:\n\u2022 Cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n\u2022 Factory burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) (placed using direction RIGHT)\n\u2022 Secondary burner inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5) (adjacent to the factory inserter)\n\u2022 Assembling machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5) that completes the copper-cable production interface\n\n### Extraction System at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n\u2022 Extraction system burner inserter at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5) with its drop position at Position(x=-3.5, y=28.5)\n  \n### Belt Depot at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\nDesigned as an isolated belt target for material routing, it consists of:\n\u2022 Wooden chest (belt depot) at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\n\u2022 Transport belt segment adjacent to the chest at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5)\n\u2022 Depot burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) (placed with direction UP; its pickup is positioned at the depot chest)\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)\nThis power-production module is composed of interconnected energy\u2010producing entities:\n\u2022 Steam engine (named \u201csteam-engine\u201d) at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)\n\u2022 Boiler at Position(x=-5.5, y=24.0)\n\u2022 Offshore pump at Position(x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Belt connection target errors\n\u2003\u2013 Transport belt connection failures repeatedly occur because the belt was attempted to be linked directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine object. Always verify that the target entity is an inserter (or similar valid input device) to properly receive items.\n\n\u2022 Placement proximity issues\n\u2003\u2013 An error when placing a wooden chest at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) was caused by the target being too far from the player\u2019s current position. Ensure the player moves within the allowed placement range before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Undefined reference in variable assignment\n\u2003\u2013 A NameError indicated the variable \u2018target_chest\u2019 was not defined when used to set a final target. Confirm that all entity reference variables are properly declared and assigned before use.\n\n\u2022 Inventory availability checks\n\u2003\u2013 An error stating \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d occurred during a placement attempt. Verify that the required item is present in the inventory before initiating any build action."}
