{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Copper plate mine at position(41, -82)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) and a furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position (39.5, -79.5)) that puts into furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position (41.5, -78.5)) connected to furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n-  Belt group that connects the furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) to the burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(60, -60)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Furnace (position (60.0, -60.0))\n\n### Electricity generator at position(117, -30)\nConsists of steam engine (position (117.5, -30.5)), boiler (position (111.5, -32.0)), and offshore pump (position (106.5, -32.5))\n-  Pipe group that connects the offshore pump at position (106.5, -32.5) to the boiler at position (111.5, -32.0)\n-  Pipe group that connects the boiler at position (111.5, -32.0) to the steam engine at position (117.5, -30.5)\n-  Electricity group with poles at positions (111.5, -30.5), (115.5, -30.5), (120.5, -26.5), (115.5, -32.5), (111.5, -27.5), and (112.5, -24.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n-  Ensure that the positions passed to the connect_entities function are integers, not floats.\n### Errors when accessing position attribute\n-  Ensure that the position object has a 'position' attribute before trying to access it. The correct attribute to access is 'x' and 'y' directly from the position object.\n### Errors when using get_entity function\n-  Ensure that the position passed to the get_entity function is a valid position object with 'x' and 'y' attributes.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   Important variables:\n    *   `offshore_pump`: OffshorePump entity\n    *   `boiler`: Boiler entity\n    *   `steam_engine`: SteamEngine entity\n    *   `burner_mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill entity\n    *   `furnace`: Furnace entity\n    *   `burner_inserter`: BurnerInserter entity\n    *   `pipe`: Pipe entity\n    *   `electricity_group`: ElectricityGroup entity\n    *   `belt_group`: BeltGroup entity\n*   Utility functions:\n    *   `connect_entities`: Function to connect entities with pipes\n    *   `get_entity`: Function to get an entity by its prototype and position\n    *   `get_position`: Function to get the position of an entity"}
