{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel but currently no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -50.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional wooden chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into full inventories\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. For example, the furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) was full when attempting to insert coal.\n\n### Warnings about full fuel sources\n- Regularly check and manage fuel levels in furnaces to prevent warnings about full fuel sources, as seen in the furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0).\n\n### Warnings about no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid idle time, as indicated by the furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0).\n\n### Warnings about full chests at drop positions\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests, as noted for the chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the target has enough capacity to avoid exceptions.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `furnace`: Represents a furnace entity where items are inserted.\n  - `inventory`: Represents the player's current inventory, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
