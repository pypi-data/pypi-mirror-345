{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at position (2.5, y=17.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n\u2013 Factory burner inserter placed at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) using direction RIGHT, which is interconnected with a burner inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5) and an assembling machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5)\n\n### Belt Depot at position (3.5, y=15.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Wooden chest serving as depot placed at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\n\u2013 Transport belt segment placed adjacent at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5)\n\u2013 Depot burner inserter located at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) using direction UP\n\n### Extraction System at position (\u20133.5, y=27.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Extraction system burner inserter located at Position(x=\u20133.5, y=27.5) with its drop position at Position(x=\u20133.5, y=28.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Connection Target Error \u2013 Transport Belt\n\u2003\u2013 When connecting transport belts, ensure the target entity is an inserter rather than a steam engine. The repeated failure to connect arises from attempting to attach belts directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine object.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range and Inventory Checks\n\u2003\u2013 When placing entities such as wooden chests, verify that the target position is within the allowed placement distance by moving closer to the position.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required item is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Variable Definition Consistency\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all referenced variables (for example, using the correct name for the target chest) are properly defined to avoid runtime NameErrors."}
