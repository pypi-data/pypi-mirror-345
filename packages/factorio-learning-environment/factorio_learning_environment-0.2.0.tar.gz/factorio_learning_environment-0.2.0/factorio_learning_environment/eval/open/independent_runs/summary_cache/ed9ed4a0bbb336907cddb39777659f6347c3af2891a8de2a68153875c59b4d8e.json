{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (5.5, 27.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the electricity network\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) connecting the furnace and chest\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (0.5, 30.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to various entities\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple PipeGroups connecting various entities, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (-14.5, 14.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-14.5, 17.5) with water\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 18.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-11.5, 19.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-7.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-3.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-5.5, 26.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (1.5, 29.5) with water\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 31.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (8.5, 34.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that the pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) and the boiler at position (5.5, 27.0).\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Too Far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Avoid placing entities where the footprint overlaps with water or other obstacles."}
