{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Water Pumping and Boiler System\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) is operational and connected to the boiler.\n- **Boiler** at position (-10.5, 21.0) is now functioning with a status of FULL_OUTPUT.\n- **Pipe Group** at position (-12.5, 21.5) is FULL_OUTPUT, indicating successful water flow from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing steam engines and electric poles\n- Ensure the target position is not obstructed before attempting to place steam engines or electric poles. Consider clearing obstructions or selecting alternative positions.\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles\n- Verify that electric poles are correctly placed and within range to connect to each other. Placement issues may prevent successful connections.\n\n### Errors related to entity statuses\n- Address the NO_INGREDIENTS status of the stone furnace by ensuring it has the necessary ingredients to operate.\n- For entities with NOT_CONNECTED status, ensure all necessary connections (e.g., pipes, electricity) are established for proper functionality.\n\n### Errors when using pipes and electricity groups\n- Ensure that electricity groups are plugged into the electric network to avoid NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK status.\n- Regularly check and clear any obstructions in pipe groups to maintain efficient flow and avoid EMPTY status."}
