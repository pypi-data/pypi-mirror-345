{"content": "The error indicates that there was an attempt to access the `PipeGroup` prototype, which is not directly accessible or may not exist in the context of the Factorio REPL environment. Let's focus on verifying and adjusting the connections using a different approach.\n\n### Steps to Ensure Proper Connection:\n\n1. **Verify Pipe Placement:**\n   - Ensure that the pipes are correctly placed between the Offshore Pump and the Boiler. The pipes should connect the output of the pump to the input of the boiler.\n\n2. **Check Boiler Orientation:**\n   - The boiler should be oriented such that its input connection aligns with the pipe coming from the Offshore Pump. If necessary, rotate the boiler to ensure alignment.\n\n3. **Re-evaluate the Connection:**\n   - Use the `connect_entities` function to explicitly connect the pump to the boiler if there are any gaps or misalignments.\n\n### Revised Code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Verify the current status of the boiler and pump\nprint(f\"Boiler Status: {boiler.status}, Offshore Pump Status: {offshore_pump.status}\")\n\n# Step 2: Ensure the boiler is correctly oriented and connected\nif boiler.status == EntityStatus.NO_INPUT_FLUID:\n    # Rotate the boiler to align with the pipe if needed\n    rotate_entity(boiler, Direction.DOWN)  # Adjust direction as necessary\n\n    # Reconnect the entities to ensure proper fluid flow\n    connect_entities(offshore_pump, boiler, Prototype.Pipe)\n    print(\"Attempted to reconnect Offshore Pump to Boiler.\")\n\n# Step 3: Confirm the connection and status\nprint(f\"Updated Boiler Status: {boiler.status}\")\n```\n\n### Tips for Successful Connection:\n\n- **Entity Alignment:** Ensure that entities are properly aligned. The boiler's input should directly face the pipe coming from the pump.\n- **Use of `connect_entities`:** This function helps in explicitly defining connections, which can resolve issues with misaligned pipes.\n- **Check Entity Status:** Regularly check the status of entities to diagnose issues. The status can provide clues about what might be wrong (e.g., \"NO_INPUT_FLUID\" suggests a connection issue).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to establish a successful connection between the Offshore Pump and the Boiler, allowing water to flow and the boiler to function correctly.", "summary_range": "[1-362]"}
