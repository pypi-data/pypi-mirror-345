Malcore Playbook is a powerful framework for automating malware analysis, malware triaging, and analyst workflows using modular recipes and scripting. Designed for SOC analysts, threat hunters, and cybersecurity professionals, Malcore Playbook allows users to build chains to automate workflows, and extract actionable intelligence from suspicious files through a simple, flexible scripting language, and individual recipes.

With its recipe system, real-time variable tracking, and conditional logic engine, Malcore Playbook transforms analyst tasks in an easily scriptable solution. Whether you're investigating advanced persistent threats (APTs), or building automated triage pipelines, Malcore Playbook gives you full control â€” without sacrificing speed, precision, or customization.

Key Features:

- Modular scriptable engine using "MalScript" syntax
- Analysis chaining and conditional logic
- Real-time execution tracing and output handling
- Full integration with Malcore's API
- Built for performance, flexibility, and deep analysis insights

## MalScript Overview

<p align="center" width="100%"><img height="201" width="474" src=".github/assets/logos/malscript_logo.png"/></p>

MalScript is a domain-specific scripting language (DSL) built specifically for the Malcore Playbook. This language is designed to automate malware analysis and file triaging workflows. By providing the ability to chain recipes and execute them conditionally, MalScript provides a powerful declarative automation to help automate reverse engineers and analysts. MalScript combines function and imperative elements to support rule-based execution, and data inspection on real-time analysis results.
