{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully created during these steps. \n\u2022 Multiple attempts were made to supply a Lab (intended for receiving Automation Science Packs to support research) at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5), but none succeeded due to crafting, resource, and placement errors.\n\u2022 Although the agent interacted with smelting furnaces (an iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) for resource processing, these were pre\u2010existing entities and are not counted as newly created structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Issues with get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid using unexpected keywords (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional arguments. Verify the correct function signature before invocation.\n\u2022 Null Reference Handling:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the result from get_entities is validated (using an empty list as fallback) before iterating, to prevent errors from a None value.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, copper-cables, and electronic-circuits) are available and craftable before attempting to craft a Lab.\n\u2003\u2013 Check resource availability and the dependency chain to prevent repeated crafting errors.\n\u2022 Placement Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the Lab is present in the inventory prior to placement to avoid errors when attempting to place a structure."}
