The error indicates that the furnace at position (0, 0) is full and cannot accept more coal.\n  \n### Errors when attempting to insert items into empty furnaces\n- If a furnace has no resources to smelt, ensure you are inserting the correct items and that the furnace is not already full with output items. The furnace at position (2, 0) has no ingredients to smelt, which leads to wasted insert attempts.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
