{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel, smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting from position (x=3.5, y=0.5) to position (x=6.5, y=0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to the end chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) collecting iron plates from the belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied\n- Ensure there is enough space to place entities like burner inserters. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or altering the reference position to avoid overlap.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from non-belt entities\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from non-belt entities like chests to belts. Direct connections are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Check inventory levels before attempting to place or craft items. Ensure you have the necessary materials, such as wood for crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required raw resources\n- Gather necessary raw resources like wood before attempting to craft items that require them."}
