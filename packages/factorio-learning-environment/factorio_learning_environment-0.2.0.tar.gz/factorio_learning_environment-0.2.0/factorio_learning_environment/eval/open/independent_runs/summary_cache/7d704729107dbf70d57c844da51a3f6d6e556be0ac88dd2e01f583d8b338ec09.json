{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(106.5, -32.5)\nConsists of offshore pump(position 106.5, -32.5) and boiler(position 111.5, -32.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when using `connect_entities` function\n  - Ensure the `connect_entities` function is called with the correct arguments, specifically the source and target positions, not the entities themselves.\n  - Make sure to pass the correct data types to the `connect_entities` function, as it expects integer positions, not float values.\n* Errors when accessing entity positions\n  - Be aware that `Position` objects do not have a `position` attribute, so do not attempt to access `offshore_pump.position.position` or `boiler.position.position`.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `offshore_pump`: `Entity` object representing the offshore pump\n  - `boiler`: `Entity` object representing the boiler\n  - `source` and `target`: `Position` objects representing the source and target positions for the `connect_entities` function\n* Utility functions:\n  - `connect_entities`: function to connect two entities with a pipe, has been invoked with incorrect arguments, resulting in errors. \n  - Summary of failure modes: \n    - Passing `Position` objects with float values instead of integer positions\n    - Passing entity objects instead of position objects\n  - Summary of success modes: None, as the function has not been successfully invoked yet."}
