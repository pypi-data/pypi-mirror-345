Use an intermediary inserter to properly feed items into powered entities.\n\n\u2022 Belt Connection Path Configuration:\n  - Validate that intermediate waypoint definitions yield a monotonic, normalisable path. Adjust offsets and alignment to avoid \u201cNot a valid path to normalise\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Consistent Connection Strategy:\n  - When multiple belt connection attempts fail, standardise the approach by checking both target entity type and ensuring the intermediate waypoints circumvent interference from nearby structures (e.g. the steam engine group)."}
