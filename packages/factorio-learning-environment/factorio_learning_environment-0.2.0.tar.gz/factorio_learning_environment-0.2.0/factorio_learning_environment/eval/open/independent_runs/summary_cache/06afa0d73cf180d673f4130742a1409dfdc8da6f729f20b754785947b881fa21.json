{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with coal as fuel, currently working. It outputs iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to no ingredients. It is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities like Wooden Chests and Transport Belts is unoccupied before attempting placement. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the drill's drop position.\"\n\n### Errors when moving Stone Furnace\n- Verify the presence of the Stone Furnace at the specified position before attempting to move it. This will prevent errors like \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.0 y=-53.0.\"\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Confirm that the desired location for placing a Burner Inserter is valid and unoccupied to avoid errors such as \"Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors related to output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill to avoid warnings like \"output blocked by item on the ground.\"\n\n### Errors due to no ingredients in the furnace\n- Regularly check the inventory of the Stone Furnace to ensure it has the necessary ingredients for smelting to avoid the status \"no ingredients to smelt.\""}
