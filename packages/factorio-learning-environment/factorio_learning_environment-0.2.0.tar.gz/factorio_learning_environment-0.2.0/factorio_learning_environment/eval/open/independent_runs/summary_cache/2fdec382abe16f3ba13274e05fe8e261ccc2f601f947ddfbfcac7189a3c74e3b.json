{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at Position(x=4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest.\n- Wooden Chest at Position(x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions (e.g., Position(x=5.5, y=-60.5), Position(x=7.5, y=-60.5), etc.) containing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=-15.0, y=-48.0) and Position(x=-13.0, y=-48.0), both with warnings indicating they are out of fuel or have no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with some coal in its fuel inventory but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Extracting from a Chest\n- Ensure the chest is not full when attempting to extract items. The chest at Position(x=4.5, y=-58.5) is full, preventing further extraction of iron ore. Empty the chest to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the Burner Mining Drill at Position(x=4.0, y=-60.0) and the Stone Furnaces to ensure continuous operation. This will prevent the 'out of fuel' warnings and allow for uninterrupted mining and smelting.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that Stone Furnaces have a consistent supply of ingredients to smelt. Currently, the furnaces at Position(x=-13.0, y=-48.0) and Position(x=-11.0, y=-48.0) lack ingredients, which halts production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the final inventory state, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
