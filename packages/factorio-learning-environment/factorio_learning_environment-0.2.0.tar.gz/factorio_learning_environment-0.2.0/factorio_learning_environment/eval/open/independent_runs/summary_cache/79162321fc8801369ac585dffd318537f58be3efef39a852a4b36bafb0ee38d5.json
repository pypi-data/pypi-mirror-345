{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the chest and furnace. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items, leading to production halts.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Consider mining additional coal or redistributing existing coal to prevent running out of fuel.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items (e.g., coal) into entities, verify that the items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, check the inserter setup and ensure that it is correctly transferring items from the chest to the furnace."}
