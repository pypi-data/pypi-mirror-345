{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Laboratory at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (2.5, 0.5) connected to the electricity network\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) used for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, you need 10 copper plates to craft copper cables but only had 2 available.\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes and Electric Poles\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For instance, failed connections between the steam engine and lab due to missing small electric poles.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Double-check the existence of entities at specified positions before performing operations. Errors were encountered when attempting to interact with non-existent labs.\n\n### NameError in Code\n- Ensure all variables and constants are correctly defined and spelled. For example, 'copper_cable_needed_for_poles' was not defined, leading to a NameError.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Use assertions to verify that entities are in the expected state. For example, ensure the steam engine is working before proceeding with dependent operations.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Maintain an adequate supply of fuel, such as coal, in your inventory to keep boilers operational. Several errors were due to insufficient coal for refueling.\n\n### Extraction and Insertion Errors\n- Ensure that the target entities for extraction or insertion operations contain the expected items. Errors occurred when trying to extract copper plates from a furnace that did not contain them."}
