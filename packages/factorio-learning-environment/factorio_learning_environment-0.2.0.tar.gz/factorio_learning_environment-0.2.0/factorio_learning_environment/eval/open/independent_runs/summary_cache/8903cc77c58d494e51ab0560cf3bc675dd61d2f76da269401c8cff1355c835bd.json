{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-7.0,22.5) [UPDATED]\n- **Boiler** at (-7.0,22.5) - Currently fueled with 20 coal (status: WORKING)\n- **Steam engine** at (-3.5,22.5) - Now connected to power network (status: WORKING)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Operational (status: WORKING)\n- **Fuel system**:\n  - Coal chest at (-6.5,19.5) - Contains 78 coal\n  - Burner inserter at (-6.5,20.5) - Fueled with 6 coal (status: WORKING)\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Still not receiving power (status: NO_POWER)\n- **Storage tank** at (21.5,40.5) - Now contains 49.42 crude oil (status: WORKING)\n\n### Oil Refinery Complex at (25.5,40.5) [UPDATED]\n- **Oil refinery** at (25.5,40.5) - Now powered (status: FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE)\n- **Pipe connections**:\n  - New 8-pipe connection between storage and refinery\n  - Input connection at (26.5,43.5) - Operational\n  - Output connection at (27.5,37.5) - Not configured\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent System Issues\n1. **Fluid connection failures** (occurred 11 times)\n   - Repeated pipe placement/connection errors between critical systems\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify exact connection points before placement\n     - Clear path between connection points\n     - Use pipe-to-ground for long distances\n\n2. **Power management problems** (occurred 9 times)\n   - Inconsistent power supply to pumpjack and refinery\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify all power pole connections\n     - Maintain minimum power buffer\n     - Implement power monitoring system\n\n3. **Distance-related placement errors** (occurred 5 times)\n   - Attempting to place entities beyond reach\n   - Solution:\n     - Always verify player position before placement\n     - Implement distance validation function\n     - Use blueprints for remote construction\n\n### New Critical Issues\n1. **Inventory management gaps** (occurred 4 times)\n   - Attempting operations without required items\n   - Solution:\n     - Maintain minimum stock of critical components\n     - Implement inventory pre-check before operations\n     - Create emergency supply chests\n\n2. **Entity status confusion** (occurred 3 times)\n   - Misinterpreting working/non-working states\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement status verification before operations\n     - Create entity status dashboard\n     - Document expected status codes\n\n3. **Connection validation failures** (occurred 3 times)\n   - Attempting invalid fluid connections\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify fluid compatibility before connections\n     - Check input/output directions\n     - Test connections with single pipe first\n\n### Previous Recommendations Still Valid\n1. Implement staged system activation\n2. Create isolation procedures for failures\n3. Document all connection points\n4. Maintain system status dashboard"}
