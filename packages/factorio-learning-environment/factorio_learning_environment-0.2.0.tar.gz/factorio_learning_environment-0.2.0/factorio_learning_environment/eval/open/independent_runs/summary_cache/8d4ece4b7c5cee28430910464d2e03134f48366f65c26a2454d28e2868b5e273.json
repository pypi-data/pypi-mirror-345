{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and connected to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Furnace Production\n- Ensure that the furnace is continuously supplied with iron ore and coal to maintain production of iron plates. Regularly check and refuel the furnace and inserter to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Verify that the pickup and drop positions are correctly set to avoid misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to prevent it from becoming full, which halts mining operations. Ensure there is enough space in the chest or transfer items to maintain continuous mining.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary to avoid interruptions in operations."}
