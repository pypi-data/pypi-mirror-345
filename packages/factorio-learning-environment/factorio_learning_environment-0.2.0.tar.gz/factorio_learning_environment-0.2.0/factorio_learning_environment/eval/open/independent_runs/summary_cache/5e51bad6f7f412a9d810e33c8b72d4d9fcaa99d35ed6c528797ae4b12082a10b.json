{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position(41.5, -80.5)) with an inventory containing 7 coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position(41.0, -82.0)) with an inventory containing 1 coal. It is currently working and successfully mining coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position(-15.0, -50.0)) with an inventory containing 8 coal and 8 iron plates. It is currently not operational due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when the Burner Mining Drill is not collecting more coal\n- The Burner Mining Drill stopped collecting coal because the chest at the drop position is full. To mitigate this, ensure to regularly empty the Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5) to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue mining.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int (total coal extracted and in inventory)\n- `wood`: int (total wood in inventory)\n- `iron-plate`: int (total iron plates in inventory)"}
