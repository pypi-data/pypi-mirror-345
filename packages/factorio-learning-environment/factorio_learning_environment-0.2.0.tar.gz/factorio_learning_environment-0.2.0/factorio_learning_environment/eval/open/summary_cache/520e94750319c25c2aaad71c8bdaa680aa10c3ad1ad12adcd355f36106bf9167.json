{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with frequently full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) serving as storage for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, feeding chests.\n- Small electric poles at (15.5, 75.5) and newly placed poles at (17.5, 72.5), (22.5, 75.5), and (12.5, 72.5) connected to the power network.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt drop position remains unresolved, causing mining drill warnings.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage with improved power coverage, but output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal and working.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) connected by pipes to boiler, generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (0.5, 6.5).\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and operational.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5).\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine now receiving iron plates directly inserted at (25.5, 80.5) and producing iron gear wheels, though output chest remains empty.\n\nThis structure is set for iron gear wheel production with power, input, and output inserters properly fueled and positioned.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt drop position\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report output blockage due to the furnace belt being blocked.\n- The furnace output inventory frequently fills, preventing further smelting output.\n- To resolve, clear or extend the output belts and ensure chests or inserters downstream have capacity to accept items.\n\n### Small electric pole placement conflicts\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near (18.0, 75.0) and (0.5, 6.5) failed due to tile occupancy by existing entities or poles.\n- Placement errors suggest increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting reference positions.\n- Always verify tile availability before placement and consider alternative nearby tiles to avoid collisions.\n\n### Assembling machine input and output inventory issues\n- Previously, assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) lacked iron plates and could not craft.\n- Recent steps show iron plates being inserted directly into assembling machine input inventory, enabling crafting of iron gear wheels.\n- However, output chest at (25.5, 82.5) remains empty, indicating possible output inserter or chest capacity issues.\n- Ensure output inserter at (25.5, 83.5) is correctly positioned and powered, and output chest has capacity.\n\n### Incorrect attribute usage in entity connections\n- Error occurred when attempting to access 'drop_position' attribute on a furnace entity, which does not exist.\n- Use correct attributes such as 'position' or 'output_position' depending on entity type.\n- Verify entity API documentation to avoid attribute errors.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and operational.\n- Maintain monitoring of inserter fuel levels and inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps."}
