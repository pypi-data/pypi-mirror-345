The `extract_item` and `harvest_resource` functions are being used incorrectly.\n- The `connect_entities` function was used with an incorrect target entity type.\n- The agent used `PrototypePrototype` which is not defined.\n\n#### Errors when using undefined variables or incorrect types\n- Ensure all variables are defined before using them and are of the correct type. Check for typos and undefined names.\n- The `place_entity_next_to` function was used with an incorrect type for the `reference_position` argument.\n- The agent used undefined names like 'entity' and 'The'.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to another entity\n- Ensure there are no collisions with existing entities or the area is not water before placing.\n- Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace or assembling machine\n- Ensure there are items to insert into the furnace or assembling machine before attempting to insert.\n- The agent failed to insert items into furnaces and drills due to lack of resources.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with pipes or belts\n- Ensure the connection points are not blocked and the target entity is able to receive the fluid or item from the source entity.\n- The `connect_entities` function was used with an entity that does not support the connection type.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces or mining drills are out of fuel or ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces and mining drills have the necessary fuel and ingredients to operate.\n- The copper and iron drills were out of fuel.\n\n#### Errors when harvesting or extracting resources\n- Ensure the target entity is within reach and contains the resource to be harvested or"}
