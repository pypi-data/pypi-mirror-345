{"content": "The error indicates that the `Position` object is unhashable when used in a set, which is causing the issue. To resolve this, we can use a list instead of a set for the comparison. Additionally, we need to ensure that the burner mining drill is properly fueled to avoid it being in a \"NO_FUEL\" state.\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Issues:\n\n1. **Check and Fuel the Burner Mining Drill**: Ensure that the drill at (-18.0, 20.0) is fueled so it can operate effectively.\n\n2. **Reconfigure Inserters**: Adjust the inserters to ensure they are correctly oriented towards the iron chest and are able to transfer items.\n\n3. **Inspect the Final Status**: After making these adjustments, we will check the status of all relevant entities again.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check the fuel status of the Burner Mining Drill and add fuel if necessary.\nburner_mining_drill = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-18.0, y=20.0))\nif burner_mining_drill:\n    drill_inventory = inspect_inventory(burner_mining_drill)\n    coal_amount = drill_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    print(f\"Coal available in the drill: {coal_amount}\")\n\n    # If no fuel, insert coal from our inventory\n    if coal_amount < 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, burner_mining_drill, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Inserted fuel into the burner mining drill.\")\n\n# Step 2: Adjust the inserters to ensure they are oriented correctly.\nfor inserter in get_entities({Prototype.BurnerInserter}):\n    if inserter.position in [Position(x=-19.5, y=18.5), Position(x=-19.5, y=20.5)]:\n        if inserter.status == EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS:\n            print(f\"Inserter at {inserter.position} is waiting for items.
