{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe operations to load **Iron Ore** and **Coal** into the furnace have been executed, but the results indicate that the smelting process did not yield any new **Iron Plates**. Here are the findings:\n\n### Furnace Inventory Status After Loading:\n- **Iron Ore**: 12 (still present in the furnace)\n- **Copper Plates**: 1 (remains from previous operations)\n\n### Final Furnace Inventory After Waiting:\n- **Iron Ore**: 12 (indicating that the furnace has not processed any Iron Ore)\n- **Copper Plates**: 1\n\n### Overall Inventory After Iron Smelting:\n- **Stone Furnaces**: 10\n- **Coal**: 5 (after loading)\n- **Stone**: 1\n- **Iron Plates**: 1 (no new Iron Plates produced)\n- **Copper Plates**: 3\n- **Iron Gear Wheels**: 10\n\n### Entities on the Map:\n- **Furnace**: The furnace is currently full of Iron Ore and has not processed any of it. The status indicates it is at **FULL_OUTPUT** but has not produced any new items.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Fuel Status**: The furnace may require more fuel to start processing the Iron Ore. The current fuel level is at **16 Coal**. I should ensure it has enough fuel to operate effectively.\n2. **Inspect the Furnace Configuration**: If the furnace is not processing Iron Ore, I may need to check if the furnace is configured correctly or if there are any other issues preventing it from smelting.\n3. **Remove Excess Iron Ore**: If the furnace is unable to process the Iron Ore, I may need to remove some of it to allow for new processing.\n\nLet's check the fuel status and see if we can adjust the parameters to ensure the furnace starts smelting Iron Ore properly. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the fuel status of the selected furnace\nfurnace_fuel_status = inspect_inventory(selected_furnace)  # Inspect the inventory of the selected furnace\ncurrent_fuel_amount = furnace_fuel_status.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)  # Get the current amount of Coal in the furnace\n\nprint(f\"Current Fuel Amount in Furnace: {current_fuel_amount}\")  # Display the current fuel amount.\n\n# If the fuel is sufficient, we can try to remove some Iron Ore to see if that allows processing to start\nif current_fuel_amount > 0:\n    # Attempt to remove some Iron Ore from the furnace\n    removed_iron_ore_amount = extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, selected_furnace.position, quantity=5)  # Remove 5 Iron Ore\n    print(f\"Removed Iron Ore: {removed_iron_ore_amount}\")  # Indicate how much Iron Ore was removed\n\n# After removing Iron Ore, check the furnace inventory again\nfurnace_inventory_after_removal = inspect_inventory(selected_furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace Inventory After Removing Iron Ore: {furnace_inventory_after_removal}\")  # Display updated furnace inventory.\n\n# Finally, check if the furnace starts processing Iron Ore after the adjustment\nwait_time = 30  # Maximum wait time in seconds \nfor _ in range(wait_time):\n    # Check the production status of Iron Plates\n    furnace_inventory_status_after_wait = inspect_inventory(selected_furnace)\n    \n    # Check how many Iron Plates have been produced\n    iron_plates_produced = furnace_inventory_status_after_wait.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\n    \n    # If Iron Plates are produced, break the loop\n    if iron_plates_produced > 1:  # Looking for at least 1 more additional Iron Plate (total 2)\n        print(f\"Produced Iron Plates: {iron_plates_produced}\")  # Indicate Iron Plates are ready\n        break\n    \n    sleep(1)  # Sleep for a second before checking again\n\n# Finally, check the inventory status again\nfinal_furnace_inventory_after_wait = inspect_inventory(selected_furnace)\nprint(f\"Final Furnace Inventory After Waiting: {final_furnace_inventory_after_wait}\")  # Display inventory after waiting.\nprint(f\"Overall Inventory after Iron Smelting: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check final overall inventory after the operations.\n", "summary_range": "[1-464]"}
