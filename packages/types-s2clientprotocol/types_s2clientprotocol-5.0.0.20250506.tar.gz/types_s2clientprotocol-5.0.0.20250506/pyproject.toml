## Typing stubs for s2clientprotocol

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`s2clientprotocol`](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
[Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses `s2clientprotocol`. This version of
`types-s2clientprotocol` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`s2clientprotocol==5.*`.

Partially generated using [mypy-protobuf==3.6.0](https://github.com/nipunn1313/mypy-protobuf/tree/v3.6.0) and libprotoc 27.2 on [s2client-proto 5.0.12.91115.0](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto/tree/c04df4adbe274858a4eb8417175ee32ad02fd609).

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/s2clientprotocol`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/s2clientprotocol)
directory.

This package was tested with
mypy 1.15.0,
pyright 1.1.400,
and pytype 2024.10.11.
It was generated from typeshed commit
[`4265ee7c72f476e7156949e55784fd82b40e6953`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/4265ee7c72f476e7156949e55784fd82b40e6953).
