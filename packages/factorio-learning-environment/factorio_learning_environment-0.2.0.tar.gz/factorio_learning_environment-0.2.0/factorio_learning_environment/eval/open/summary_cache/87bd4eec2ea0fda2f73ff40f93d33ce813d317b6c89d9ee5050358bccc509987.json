{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, currently out of fuel and not working\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) facing up, currently out of fuel and without ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) facing right, intended to move iron plates from furnace to chest, currently out of fuel and waiting for source items\n\nThis structure forms a basic iron ore mining and smelting setup, designed to extract iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and collect the plates in the chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing burner inserter adjacent to occupied tiles\n- When placing burner inserters next to furnaces or chests, ensure that the target tile is free of other entities. The attempts to place burner inserters next to the furnace at (16.0, 73.0) and drill at (16.0, 71.0) failed because the adjacent tiles were occupied by a wooden chest and stone furnace respectively.\n- To avoid this, increase the spacing parameter when placing inserters, change the direction of placement, or select a different reference position to find an unoccupied tile.\n\n### Errors inserting items when inventory is empty\n- Attempting to insert coal into an inserter without having coal in the inventory caused an error.\n- Always verify that the inventory contains the required items before attempting insertion.\n\n### Fuel management and entity status\n- The burner mining drill, furnace, and burner inserter frequently ran out of fuel, causing them to stop working or wait.\n- Ensure continuous supply of fuel (coal) to all burner-type entities to maintain operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
