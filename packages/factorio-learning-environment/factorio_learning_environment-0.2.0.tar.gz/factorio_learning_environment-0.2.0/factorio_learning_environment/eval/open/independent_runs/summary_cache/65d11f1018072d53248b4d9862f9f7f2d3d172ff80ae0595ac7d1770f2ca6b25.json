{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=53.5, y=-78.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position(x=54.5, y=-78.5) for moving iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0) for mining coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=41.5, y=-80.5) for storing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position(x=42.5, y=-80.5) for moving coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- **Issue:** Attempted to connect belts directly from a `Prototype.WoodenChest` object.\n- **Solution:** Use an inserter to take items from the chest before connecting belts.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- **Issue:** Attempted to place a burner inserter at a position already occupied by another burner inserter.\n- **Solution:** Increase the spacing, change the direction, or adjust the reference position when placing entities.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts over invalid paths\n- **Issue:** Repeated failures to connect belts from a burner inserter at position(x=54.5, y=-78.5) to position(x=60.0, y=-78.5).\n- **Solution:** Ensure the path between the start and end points is clear and valid. Consider using underground belts or adjusting the path to avoid obstacles.\n\n#### Errors when mining drill output is full\n- **Issue:** Burner mining drill at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0) is waiting for space in the destination chest.\n- **Solution:** Empty the chest at position(x=41.5, y=-80.5) to allow the mining drill to continue operation.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **`get_connection_amount(belt_start, belt_end, Prototype.TransportBelt)`**\n  - **Failure Modes:** \n    - Cannot connect belts directly from a `Prototype.WoodenChest`.\n    - Invalid path to normalize between specified positions.\n  - **Success Modes:** \n    - Successfully calculates the number of belts needed for a valid connection.\n\n- **`place_entity_next_to(Prototype.BurnerInserter, position, direction, spacing)`**\n  - **Failure Modes:** \n    - Attempted placement in an occupied tile.\n  - **Success Modes:** \n    - Places the entity next to the specified position with the given direction and spacing.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **`iron_plate_chest.position`**: Position(x=53.5, y=-78.5)\n- **`belt_start`**: Position(x=54.5, y=-78.5)\n- **`belt_end`**: Position(x=60.0, y=-78.5)"}
