{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions, including (-47.5, -122.5) to (-45.5, -117.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (19.5, -63.5) and (-16.5, -97.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Small Electric Pole at Position (5.5, -60.5)\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab connected to an Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before placing an entity. For example, the steam engine placement failed due to an obstruction at (-39.0, -131.0).\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors with entity retrieval\n- Verify the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. The attempt to get a steam engine at position (-40.5, -113.5) failed because no entity was found.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all electrical components, such as inserters and labs, are properly connected to a power source. The inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) is not receiving power, which is necessary for its operation."}
