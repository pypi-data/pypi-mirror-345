PyHipp is a computational toolkit, designed mainly for astronomical researches.
We pre-release this package, as our other projects depend extensively on it.
The package is still under active update, subjecting to structural changes and
functional extensions. The docs are still incomplete, and testings do not cover the 
full source tree, which we will continue to complete.

To install `pyhipp` and automatically handle the dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install pyhipp
```

## Usage 

See the Jupyter notebooks under `docs/`.
- `io.ipynb`: I/O facilities for data I/O, e.g., with HDF5.
- `astro.ipynb`: Astronomy-related functionalities, e.g. cosmological computations.
