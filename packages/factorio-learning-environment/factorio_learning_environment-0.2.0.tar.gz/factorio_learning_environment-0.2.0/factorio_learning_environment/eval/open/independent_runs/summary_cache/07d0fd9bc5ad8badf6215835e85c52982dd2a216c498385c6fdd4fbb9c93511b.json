{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5). It is currently working but has a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing transferred coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) awaiting source items to transfer coal to another location.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Warnings of Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage. The chest at (-11.5, -49.5) is full and needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source of the inserters has available items to transfer. The inserter at (-13.5, -46.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential supply chain issue.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
