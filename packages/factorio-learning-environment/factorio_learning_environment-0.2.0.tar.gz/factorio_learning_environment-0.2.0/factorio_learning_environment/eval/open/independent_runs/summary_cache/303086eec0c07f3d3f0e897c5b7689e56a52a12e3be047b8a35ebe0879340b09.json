{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and depositing it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions such as (4.5, y=-58.5), (5.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5), and (8.5, y=-60.5) used for storing extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnaces are fueled by coal and have varying statuses such as FULL_OUTPUT and NO_INGREDIENTS.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Coal Harvesting** at position (40.5, y=-82.5) where coal is collected for refueling purposes.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) is refueled periodically to ensure continuous operation.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the output inventory of the furnaces is regularly emptied to prevent them from reaching FULL_OUTPUT status. This will allow continuous production without halting due to full output slots.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly supply iron ore to all active furnaces to avoid the NO_INGREDIENTS status. This ensures that furnaces are always operational and producing iron plates.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly empty the chests at drop positions, such as the chest at (4.5, y=-58.5), to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined or invoked in the current logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_chest_position`: Position of the chest storing iron ore (Position(x=4.5, y=-58.5)).\n  - `furnace_positions`: List of positions of furnaces used for smelting (e.g., Position(x=-15.0, y=-48.0), Position(x=-13.0, y=-48.0)).\n  - `coal_inventory`: Inventory tracking coal supply for refueling (e.g., Inventory({'coal': 45})).\n  - `iron_plate_inventory`: Inventory tracking the number of iron plates (e.g., Inventory({'iron-plate': 7569}))."}
