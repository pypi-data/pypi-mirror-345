This setup is integrated into a transport\u2011belt network that distributes the mined ore.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\nCentered on a boiler at (8.0, 20.5) (currently out of fuel) with connection points at (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5). A series of steam engines are placed at:\n\u2022 (0.5, 9.5)  \n\u2022 (18.5, 11.5)  \n\u2022 (1.5, 13.5)  \n\u2022 (13.5, 14.5)  \n\u2022 (19.5, 14.5)  \n\u2022 (22.5, 18.5)  \n\u2022 (17.5, 20.5)  \n\u2022 (12.5, 21.5)  \n\u2022 (4.5, 23.5)  \nAdditionally, an extra steam engine remains unplaced due to severe congestion in the boiler area and obstruction in the buildable zone near (8.5, 22.5); diagnostic reports from multiple steps confirm that this placement issue persists.\n\n### Automation Research Lab\nFeatures a lab configured for automation science pack research; however, it continues to experience unstable power connectivity.\n\n### Electrical and Transport Infrastructure\nComprises an integrated network of electrical poles organized into electricity groups, multiple belt groups for managing transport belts, and pipe groups that bundle fluid pipes\u2014ensuring coordinated flow of power, materials, and fluids.\n\n### Offshore Pump and Fluid Network\nConsists of an offshore pump at (0.5, 30.5) that feeds water into the fluid system through a connected network of pipes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Persistent Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  \u2013 The extra steam engine remains unplaceable due to severe congestion around the boiler area (8.0, 20.5) and an obstructed buildable region near (8.5, 22.5), with overlapping and misaligned burner\u2011inserters and transport belts.  \n  \u2013 Tip: Conduct a thorough manual inspection of the boiler and its surrounding connection interfaces. Remove, reposition, or adjust interfering entities and consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested area or modifying the boiler layout to create sufficient clearance.\n\n\u2022 Burner Fuel Supply Shortages  \n  \u2013 Multiple burner\u2011inserter and mining drill entities are frequently reported as \u201cout of fuel\u201d or \u201cwaiting for source items.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Tip: Ensure proper placement of fuel sources adjacent to these burner\u2011powered entities and maintain a continuous supply to prevent operational stalls.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connectivity and Fluid Input Issues  \n  \u2013 Several steam engines display warnings such as \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d and \u201cno input liquid\u201d or \u201cno fluid present in connections.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Tip: Verify and reconfigure electrical cabling and fluid piping networks to ensure all steam engines are adequately connected and receive necessary inputs.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Deficiency  \n  \u2013 The automation lab consistently experiences unstable power connectivity.  \n  \u2013 Tip: Reassess the placement and wiring of nearby electrical poles to provide a more reliable power supply to the lab.\n\n\u2022 General Layout Congestion  \n  \u2013 The cluttered boiler region and overlapping transport structures impede the placement of additional entities.  \n  \u2013 Tip: Reevaluate the overall spatial layout to reduce overlaps and clear obstructed zones, thereby allowing proper placement of structures and smoother interconnections."}
