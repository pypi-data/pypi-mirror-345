Use the correct signature to retrieve entities.\n\n\u2022 Unchecked None Iteration  \n  \u2013 Verify that get_entities returns a valid (non\u2010None) collection before attempting to iterate over its results.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Without Inventory  \n  \u2013 Confirm that the Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement at a specific location.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Failures Due to Missing Sub\u2010Ingredients  \n  \u2013 Ensure that all required components (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available or craftable. Verify the completeness of the resource dependency chain (including necessary smelting steps) before initiating Lab production."}
