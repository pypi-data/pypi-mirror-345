Empty it if necessary.\n\n### Errors when extracting from storage\n- Verify that the storage contains the items you are trying to extract. If extraction fails, check the inventory of the storage.\n\n### Errors when transferring items to furnaces\n- Ensure the furnace has available space and the correct ingredients before transferring items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
