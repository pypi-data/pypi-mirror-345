{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel (coal: 10), input (iron-ore: 20), and output (iron-plate: 30)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Ensure you have all required sub-ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, to craft a Burner Mining Drill, you need iron plates and iron gear wheels, which in turn require iron plates. Additionally, crafting iron gear wheels requires iron plates, which must be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before inserting them into an entity. For example, you cannot insert iron ore into the Stone Furnace if you do not have any iron ore available.\n\n### Errors when smelting\n- Check that the Stone Furnace has enough fuel and input materials. If you encounter a \"Smelting timeout - check fuel and inputs\" error, it indicates that the furnace is not receiving the necessary resources to operate.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect types in function calls\n- Ensure that the correct type of argument is passed to functions. For example, when inserting items, the second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position.\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any entity. For example, if you receive an error stating \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory,\" it indicates that you need to gather more iron ore before trying again."}
