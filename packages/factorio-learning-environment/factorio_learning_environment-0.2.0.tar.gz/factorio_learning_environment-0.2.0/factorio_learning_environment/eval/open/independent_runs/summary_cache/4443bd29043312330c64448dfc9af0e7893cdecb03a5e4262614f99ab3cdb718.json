{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -82.5)\n- Transport Belts connecting the drill to the inserter at position (41.5, -84.5), (41.5, -83.5), (41.5, -82.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5) transferring items to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -81.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Item Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Transport Belt network facilitating movement of items across various positions, including:\n  - BeltGroup with belts at positions (41.5, -82.5) to (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -84.5) to (42.5, -85.5)\n  - Additional BeltGroups and belts facilitating item movement in various directions\n\n### Item Collection and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring items into a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target position is free from other entities or obstacles before attempting to place a new entity to avoid placement failures.\n- When placing entities like inserters or chests, verify that the position is valid and not blocked by existing structures.\n\n### Errors with invalid input types\n- Ensure that all inputs, such as dimensions for entities, are valid integers to avoid validation errors during placement.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of required resources before attempting to craft or place entities to avoid crafting failures.\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- Connect belts to the correct entities using inserters where necessary, as belts cannot directly input items into chests.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect entity spacing\n- When placing entities like inserters, ensure there is adequate spacing and correct orientation to avoid collisions or misplacements. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary."}
