Empty the chest at (40.5, -83.5) to continue mining.'\n- Wooden Chest at Position(x=40.5, y=-83.5) with inventory: {'coal': 159}\n- Transport Belt at Position(x=42.5, y=-81.5) and Position(x=42.5, y=-80.5)\n\n### Coal Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position(x=44.5, y=-83.5) with warnings: 'chest is full', inventory: {'coal': 650, 'iron-plate': 300}\n\n### Furnace and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=61.0, y=-54.0) with warnings: 'no ingredients to smelt'\n- Wooden Chest at Position(x=61.5, y=-52.5) with inventory: {'stone-brick': 10, 'wood': 6, 'coal': 650, 'stone': 5}\n- Burner Inserter at Position(x=62.5, y=-53.5) with warnings: 'waiting for source items'\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups connecting various parts of the factory:\n- BeltGroup with 7 belts connecting positions from (x=45.5, y=-82.5) to (x=48.5, y=-79.5)\n- BeltGroup with 51 belts connecting positions from (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=63.5, y=-50.5)\n- BeltGroup with 67 belts connecting positions from (x=42.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.5, y=-46.5)\n- BeltGroup with 49 belts connecting positions from (x=44.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.5, y=-54.5)\n- BeltGroup with 23 belts connecting positions from (x=49.5, y=-80.5) to (x=60.5, y=-69.5)\n- BeltGroup with 19 belts connecting positions from (x=49.5, y=-78.5) to (x=58.5, y=-69.5)\n- BeltGroup with 19 belts connecting positions from (x=50.5, y=-79.5) to (x=59.5, y=-70.5)\n- BeltGroup with 23 belts connecting positions from (x=59.5, y=-68.5) to (x=67.5, y=-54.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that your inventory has enough space before attempting to harvest resources. Consider building additional storage or managing existing inventory to prevent fullness.\n- Before inserting items into a chest, verify that there is enough space in the chest to accommodate the items. If the chest is full, consider using additional chests or managing the contents to free up space.\n\n### Resource Supply Chain Errors\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to supply furnaces or other entities. Regularly check and replenish resources to avoid supply chain disruptions.\n\n### Output Blockage Errors\n- Regularly clear output blockages by ensuring that output chests or belts are not full. This will prevent stoppages in production and resource extraction.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as burner mining drills and inserters, have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed to maintain continuous operation.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'stone-furnace', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
