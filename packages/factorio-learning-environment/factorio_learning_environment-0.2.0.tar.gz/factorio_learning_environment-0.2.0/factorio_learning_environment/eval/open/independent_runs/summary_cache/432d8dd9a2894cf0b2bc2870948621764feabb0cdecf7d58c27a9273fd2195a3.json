{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Copper Furnace\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) for smelting copper ore\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or mining drills. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors Due to Fuel Shortage\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of mining drills and furnaces to avoid them running out of fuel, which leads to warnings such as \"out of fuel.\"\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt, as indicated by warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the source inventory has the required items before calling this function to avoid insertion errors.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity.\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n  - Inventory variables such as `stone-furnace`, `wood`, `coal`, `stone`, `iron-plate`, and `copper-plate` are tracked for resource management."}
