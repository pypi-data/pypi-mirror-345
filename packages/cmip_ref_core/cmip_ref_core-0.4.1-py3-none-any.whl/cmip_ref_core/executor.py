        Execute a metric

        No results are returned from this method,

        In future, we may return a `Future` object that can be used to retrieve the result,

        Parameters
        ----------
        provider
            Provider of the metric
        metric
            Metric to run
        definition
            Definition of the information needed to execute a metric

            This definition describes which datasets are required to run the metric and where
            the output should be stored.
        metric_execution_result
            Result of the metric execution

            This is a database object that contains the results of the execution.
            If provided, it will be updated with the results of the execution.
            This may happen asynchronously, so the results may not be immediately available.
