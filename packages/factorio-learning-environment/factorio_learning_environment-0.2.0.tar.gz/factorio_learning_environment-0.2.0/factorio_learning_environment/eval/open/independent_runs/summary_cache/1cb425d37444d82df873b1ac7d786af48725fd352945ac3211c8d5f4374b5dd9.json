{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-11.5, 69.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 69.5)\n- Boiler at position(-6.0, 71.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, 75.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups for water and steam\nThe system is fully operational with the steam engine working and the boiler now fueled with coal.\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at Position(27.5, 85.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 at position(27.5, 85.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 at position(30.5, 85.5)\n- Small electric pole at position(29.5, 83.5)\n- Transport belt from drill 1 at position(27.5, 87.5) extending down\nBoth drills are operational and connected to power, with drill 1 outputting to a belt and drill 2 currently having its output blocked.\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at Position(28.0, 91.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 at position(28.0, 91.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone furnace 2 at position(31.0, 91.0) with coal fuel\nBoth furnaces are fueled but currently have no ingredients to smelt as they are not properly connected to the mining operation.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small electric poles connecting the steam engine to the mining drills\n- Electricity group with ID 2712 spanning from the steam engine to the mining area\nThe power network is operational with sufficient voltage (492557) to power the electric mining drills.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities that are too far apart\n- When connecting entities with belts or pipes, ensure there is a valid path between them\n- Use intermediate belts to create a valid path when connecting distant points\n\n### Errors when placing entities on invalid terrain\n- Check the terrain before placing entities to ensure it's not water or otherwise unplaceable\n- Scout the area first to find suitable placement locations\n\n### Errors when connecting fluid entities\n- Ensure boilers and steam engines are properly connected with pipes\n- Make sure connection points are not blocked and are properly aligned\n\n### Errors when placing entities where others already exist\n- Check if an entity already exists at the target position before placing a new one\n- Remove existing entities first if you need to replace them\n- Example: \"Could not place transport-belt at (30.5, 87.5), entity already exists at the target position\"\n- Example: \"Could not place pipe at (-7.5, 71.5), entity already exists at the target position\"\n\n### Errors when placing entities too close to other structures\n- Ensure there is enough space around the target position for the new entity\n- Example: \"Could not find a suitable position to place burner-inserter at the target location, as there are existing objects in the way\"\n- Example: \"Could not find a suitable position to place transport-belt at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way\"\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Ensure inserters have enough space for their base and arm movement\n- Check that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are valid and accessible\n- Example: \"Could not place burner-inserter at (39.0, 95.0), Cannot place burner-inserter at the target location\""}
