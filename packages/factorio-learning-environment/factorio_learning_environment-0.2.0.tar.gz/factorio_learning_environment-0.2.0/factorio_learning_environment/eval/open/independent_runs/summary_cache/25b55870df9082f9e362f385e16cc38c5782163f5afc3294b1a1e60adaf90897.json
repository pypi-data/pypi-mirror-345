{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5)\nCurrently operational and producing copper plates\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), and (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Three output wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5)\nCurrently not operational due to lack of fuel\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Four input burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5)\n- Four output burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- Four input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Four output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5)\nCurrently idle due to lack of input materials\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Output Blocking Issues\n- When setting up mining drills, ensure there is a proper output entity (like a chest or belt) aligned with the drill's drop position before starting operation\n- The copper mining drill's output is currently blocked by items on ground due to misalignment\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Maintain adequate fuel supplies in inventory before attempting to refuel machines\n- Multiple mining drills are non-operational due to lack of fuel\n- Consider setting up automated fuel delivery systems for mining operations\n\n### Entity Placement Alignment\n- Pay careful attention to exact positioning when placing entities that need to interact with each other\n- Use the drop_position property of mining drills to properly align receiving entities (furnaces, chests, etc.)"}
