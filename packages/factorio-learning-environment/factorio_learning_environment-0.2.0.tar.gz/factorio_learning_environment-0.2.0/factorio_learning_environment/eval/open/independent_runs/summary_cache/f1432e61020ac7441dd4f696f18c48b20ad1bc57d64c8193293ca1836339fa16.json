{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) which is currently out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-9.5, y=-48.5) configured to supply the furnace, currently waiting for source items.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting various components, with inputs and outputs facilitating material movement.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-15.5, y=-53.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-52.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-9.5, y=-48.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when finding a suitable position for the wooden chest\n- Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions in the desired area before placing a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a stone furnace\n- Use an inserter to connect a stone furnace to a belt, as belts cannot be directly connected to furnaces.\n\n### Insufficient coal to refuel all inserters\n- Regularly check coal inventory and ensure a steady supply to refuel all inserters efficiently.\n\n### Still no iron plates found in the furnace\n- Investigate the supply chain to ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnace for smelting."}
