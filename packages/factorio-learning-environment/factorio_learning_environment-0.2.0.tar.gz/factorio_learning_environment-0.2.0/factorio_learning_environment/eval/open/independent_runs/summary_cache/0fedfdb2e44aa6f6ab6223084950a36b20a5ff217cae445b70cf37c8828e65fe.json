{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron and Copper Mining Complex at (-28, -61)\nConsists of a burner mining drill extracting both iron and copper ore, connected to:\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5) for ore collection\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0) for smelting\n- Burner inserter system that moves materials between components\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing processed plates\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nSeries of 3 burner mining drills extracting iron ore:\n- First drill at (-10.0, -59.0)\n- Second drill at (-8.0, -59.0) \n- Third drill at (-6.0, -59.0)\nConnected to wooden chests and transport belt system for ore movement\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (37, -85)\nSimple coal extraction setup with:\n- Burner mining drill at (37.0, -85.0)\n- Collection chest at (36.5, -86.5)\n\n### Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nLarge smelting complex consisting of:\n- 4 stone furnaces in a row at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chest system at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chest system at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserter network connecting components\n\n### Power Generation System at (4.5, 20.5)\nPower plant setup with:\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 20.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5, 22.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected pipe network for water flow\n- Small electric pole network at (7.5, 20.5) and (11.5, 20.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with resource gathering API\n- When using Resource enums in get_entities(), ensure using the correct enum value attribute\n\n### Errors with crafting non-craftable items\n- Coal cannot be crafted as it is a raw resource that must be mined\n- Check if an item is craftable before attempting to craft it\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Ensure target placement location is clear of other entities before placing\n- Check entity dimensions and required free space\n\n### Fuel-related errors\n- Multiple burner mining drills and inserters are without fuel\n- Ensure fuel is supplied to burner entities before expecting them to operate\n\n### Connection errors\n- Steam engine has no input liquid - ensure proper pipe connections\n- Check fluid system connections are complete between components"}
