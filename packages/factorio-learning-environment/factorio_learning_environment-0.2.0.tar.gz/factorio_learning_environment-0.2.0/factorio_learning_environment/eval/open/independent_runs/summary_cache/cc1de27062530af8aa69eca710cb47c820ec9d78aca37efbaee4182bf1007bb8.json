Copper plates need to be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Power Poles\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect small electric poles. Ensure that the poles are within connection range.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full output chests.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional power network. Check for any disconnected poles or missing connections."}
