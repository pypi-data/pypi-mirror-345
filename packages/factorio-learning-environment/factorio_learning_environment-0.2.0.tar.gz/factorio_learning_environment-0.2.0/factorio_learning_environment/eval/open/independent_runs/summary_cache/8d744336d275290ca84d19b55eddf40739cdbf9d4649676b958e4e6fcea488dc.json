{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel and currently working, but has a warning that the chest at drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) storing 696 iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) currently has coal as fuel but is not smelting due to no ingredients available and the result chest being full.\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) storing 100 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when refueling the Burner Mining Drill**\n  - Ensure that the drill is not full before attempting to refuel it. The warning indicates that the chest at the drop position is full, which prevents further mining.\n  \n- **Errors when using the Stone Furnace**\n  - Make sure to provide the necessary ingredients for smelting. The furnace is currently not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n- **Errors when interacting with entities**\n  - Always check the status of entities before performing actions. For example, the furnace has warnings indicating it cannot operate, which should be addressed before feeding it more resources.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Functions Defined:**\n  - `refuel(entity: Entity, fuel: Item) -> None`: Invoked successfully multiple times to refuel the Burner Mining Drill.\n  - `feed(entity: Entity, item: Item) -> None`: Invoked successfully to feed the Stone Furnace with iron ore.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position: Tuple[float, float]` - position of the burner mining drill.\n  - `stone_furnace_position: Tuple[float, float]` - position of the stone furnace.\n  - `wooden_chest_position: Tuple[float, float]` - position of the wooden chest."}
