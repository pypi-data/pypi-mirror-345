{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) supplying iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Multiple iron chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), and (-8.5, -49.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Coal and Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting.\n- Multiple iron chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), and (47.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) for transferring items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Management\n- Ensure there is sufficient space in your inventory before attempting to harvest resources. Consider creating more storage chests if inventory is frequently full.\n\n### Errors When Refueling or Supplying Furnaces\n- Always check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary resources before attempting to refuel or supply furnaces. Maintain a stock of iron ore and coal in your inventory to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors When Extracting from Chests\n- Verify that the chest is not full before attempting to extract items. Clear out space in the chest or transfer items to another storage to facilitate extraction.\n\n### Errors When Placing Additional Storage Chests\n- Ensure that the code logic for placing storage chests is correct and does not involve unsupported operations, such as incorrect data types in calculations.\n\n### Errors When Clearing Blockages\n- Regularly monitor and clear blockages at inserter drop positions to ensure smooth operation of the production line."}
