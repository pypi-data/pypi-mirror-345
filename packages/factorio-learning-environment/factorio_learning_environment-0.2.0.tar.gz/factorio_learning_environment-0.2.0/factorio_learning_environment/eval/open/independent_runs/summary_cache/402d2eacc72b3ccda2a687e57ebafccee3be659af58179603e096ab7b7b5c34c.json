{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (-15.0, -50.0))\n- Wooden chest (position (-14.5, -48.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (-13.5, -48.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (-12.5, -48.5))\n\n#### Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (52.0, -79.0))\n- Burner inserter (position (53.5, -79.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (54.5, -79.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (55.5, -78.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (56.5, -78.5))\n\n#### Storage Area at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (0.5, 0.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (1.5, 0.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 0.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (4.5, 0.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (5.5, 0.5))\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining drill not working due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure the burner mining drill has sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) to operate. Check the fuel inventory of the drill and refill it if necessary.\n\n#### Inserter out of fuel\n- Ensure all burner inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Check the fuel inventory of the inserters and refill them if necessary.\n\n#### Chest at drop position is full\n- Empty the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to allow it to continue mining. Ensure there is enough space in the chest for the mined resources.\n\n#### Furnace has no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to smelt. Check the furnace's inventory and supply it with the required materials.\n\n#### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to the source items it needs to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity and ensure it contains the items the inserter is trying to move.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- None assigned yet."}
