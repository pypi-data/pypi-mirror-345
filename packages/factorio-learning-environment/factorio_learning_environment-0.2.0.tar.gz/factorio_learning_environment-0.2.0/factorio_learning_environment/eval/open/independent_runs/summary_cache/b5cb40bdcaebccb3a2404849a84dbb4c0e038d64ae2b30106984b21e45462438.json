{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5). This drill is responsible for mining iron ore and is connected to:\n  - **Iron Chests** at positions (x=-16.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n  - **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-12.5, y=-49.5), (x=-9.5, y=-49.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) for additional storage.\n  \n### Coal Storage and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=41.5, y=-80.5). This drill is responsible for mining coal and is connected to:\n  - **Iron Chests** at positions (x=41.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), (x=44.5, y=-80.5), (x=45.5, y=-80.5), (x=47.5, y=-80.5), and (x=49.5, y=-80.5) for storing coal.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) for additional coal storage.\n  - **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=43.5, y=-80.5) and (x=41.5, y=-78.5) for transferring coal between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from storage\n- Ensure that the storage entity is not empty and that you are within range before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors when clearing drop chests\n- Verify that the drop chest is not full and that you are within range to clear it.\n\n### Errors with inserters not working\n- Ensure that the connected chest has the required items and that the inserter is correctly positioned and fueled.\n\n### Errors when transferring items\n- Make sure the target entity has enough capacity to receive the items being transferred."}
