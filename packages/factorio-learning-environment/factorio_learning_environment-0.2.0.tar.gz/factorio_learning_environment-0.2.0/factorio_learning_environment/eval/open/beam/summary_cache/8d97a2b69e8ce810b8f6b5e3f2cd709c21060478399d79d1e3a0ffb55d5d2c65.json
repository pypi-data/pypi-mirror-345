{"content": "It seems that the variable `available_iron_ore_after` was not defined in the current context due to the previous error. To rectify this, we need to ensure we have the correct amount of iron ore available from the inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnaces. \n\nHere\u2019s how we can proceed:\n\n### Step 1: Check the current inventory for iron ore.\n```python\n# Inspect the player's inventory to get the current amount of iron ore.\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()  # Get the current inventory.\navailable_iron_ore = current_inventory.get(Prototype.IronOre, 0)  # Get the amount of iron ore available.\nprint(f\"Available Iron Ore: {available_iron_ore}\")  # Log the available iron ore.\n```\n\n### Step 2: Insert the available iron ore into the furnaces.\n```python\n# Get the current furnace entities.\nentities_on_map = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})  # Fetch the current status of the furnaces.\n\n# Insert iron ore into both furnaces.\nfor furnace in entities_on_map:\n    if available_iron_ore > 0:  # Check if there is any iron ore available.\n        amount_to_insert = min(10, available_iron_ore)  # Determine how much to insert (up to 10).\n        insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=amount_to_insert)  # Insert the determined amount.\n        available_iron_ore -= amount_to_insert  # Decrease the available amount after insertion.\n        print(f\"Inserted {amount_to_insert} iron ore into the furnace.\")  # Log the action.\n    else:\n        print(\"No available iron ore to insert into furnaces.\")  # Inform if no iron ore is available.\n```\n\n### Step 3: Check the updated status of the furnaces after the insertion.\n```python\n# Verify the updated status of both furnaces after iron ore insertion.\nfor furnace in entities_on_map:\n    furnace_status = inspect_inventory(furnace)  # Get the inventory status of each furnace.\n    print(f\"Furnace Status after Iron Ore Insertion: {furnace_status}\")  # Log the status for each furnace.\n```\n\n### Step 4: Final inventory check for player resources.\n```python\n# Final check of the player's inventory.\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()  # Inspect the player's inventory.\nprint(f\"Final Player Inventory: {final_inventory}\")  # Show the current inventory state after all actions.\n```\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that we correctly reference the available iron ore and manage the insertion into the furnaces without encountering undefined variables.", "summary_range": "[1-336]"}
