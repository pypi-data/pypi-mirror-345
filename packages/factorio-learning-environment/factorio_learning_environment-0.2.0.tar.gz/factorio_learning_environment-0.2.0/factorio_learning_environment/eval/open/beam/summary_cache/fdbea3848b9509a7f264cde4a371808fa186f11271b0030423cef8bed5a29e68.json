{"content": "I notice from the output that the mining drill is showing a warning: \"waiting for space in destination as the output is full\". We need to place a chest to collect the items. Let's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n# First let's place a chest to collect items from the drill\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Found drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n# Place chest near the drill's output\nchest = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at {chest.position}\")\n\n# Now place the inserter between drill and chest\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=Position(\n        x=(drill.drop_position.x + chest.position.x) / 2,\n        y=(drill.drop_position.y + chest.position.y) / 2\n    ),\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to the inserter\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\nprint(\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Check the status of our setup\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter status: {inserter.status}\")\nprint(f\"Chest inventory: {inspect_inventory(chest)}\")\n```\n\nThis should create a working chain:\n1. Mining drill extracts ore\n2. Inserter picks up ore from drill's output\n3. Inserter places ore into the chest\n\nThe key changes are:\n1. Adding a chest as the destination for items\n2. Positioning the inserter between the drill's output and the chest\n3. Making sure the inserter is facing the right direction (from drill to chest)\n\nLet me know if you need any adjustments to the positioning or setup!", "summary_range": "[1-2890]"}
