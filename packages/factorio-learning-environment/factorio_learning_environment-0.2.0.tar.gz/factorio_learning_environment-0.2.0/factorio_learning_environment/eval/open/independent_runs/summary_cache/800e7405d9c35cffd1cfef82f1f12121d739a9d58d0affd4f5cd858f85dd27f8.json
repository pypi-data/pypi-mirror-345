Verify positions and ensure they are correct.\n\n### Errors when checking attributes of NoneType\n- Before accessing attributes of an entity, check if the entity is not None. This prevents AttributeError when the entity does not exist.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities at the target position.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
