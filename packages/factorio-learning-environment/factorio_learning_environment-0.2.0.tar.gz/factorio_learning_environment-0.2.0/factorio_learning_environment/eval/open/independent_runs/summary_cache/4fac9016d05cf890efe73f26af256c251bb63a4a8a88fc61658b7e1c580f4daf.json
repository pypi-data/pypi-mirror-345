{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The drill is operational but has a warning indicating that its output is blocked by an item on the ground, and there is no sink entity to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace is not operational due to a lack of ingredients to smelt, although it has a stored inventory of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid positions\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Burner Inserters, Stone Furnaces, Transport Belts, and Wooden Chests is unoccupied and valid before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied or invalid positions\n- Verify that the target location for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is unoccupied and valid before attempting to move.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors related to missing entities.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Maintain an adequate supply of necessary items in your inventory, such as coal, to avoid errors when attempting to insert items into entities.\n\n### Output blockage warnings\n- Address output blockage warnings by ensuring that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like the Burner Mining Drill."}
