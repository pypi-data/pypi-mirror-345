{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (15 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (42 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Burner Inserter Placement Errors**: Ensure there is enough space and the correct orientation when placing a burner inserter next to a chest or drill. Multiple attempts to place a burner inserter failed due to insufficient space.\n- **Wooden Chest Placement Errors**: Verify that the target location for placing a wooden chest is clear and suitable. Several attempts to place a wooden chest failed due to occupied or unsuitable locations.\n- **Transport Belt Placement Errors**: Confirm that the desired location for a transport belt is valid and unobstructed before placing it.\n- **Stone Furnace Movement Errors**: Ensure that the new location for moving a stone furnace is clear and suitable.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- **Iron Ore Extraction Errors**: Move closer to the target entity containing iron ore before attempting extraction. An error occurred due to the absence of a valid entity containing iron ore at the specified location.\n\n### General Tips\n- Always check for warnings and status updates on entities to ensure they are functioning correctly and efficiently.\n- Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to prevent blockage and ensure continuous operation."}
