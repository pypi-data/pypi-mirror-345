{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, including pipes at positions such as (-47.5, -122.5) and (-44.5, -118.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) for ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0) for smelting\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items between entities\n- Small Electric Pole network for power distribution\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Lab with input at position (not specified), currently not powered\n- Multiple Pipe Groups and Electricity Groups for fluid and power distribution across various positions\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Verify that there are no obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Boiler Not Operational\n- Double-check the connections and ensure the boiler is receiving the necessary input liquid. Verify that all components are correctly connected and operational.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the power network to ensure that all inserters and other electrical entities are connected to a functioning power source. Extend the electric pole network if necessary to cover all entities.\n\n### Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel, which halts production.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials for smelting to maintain production efficiency."}
