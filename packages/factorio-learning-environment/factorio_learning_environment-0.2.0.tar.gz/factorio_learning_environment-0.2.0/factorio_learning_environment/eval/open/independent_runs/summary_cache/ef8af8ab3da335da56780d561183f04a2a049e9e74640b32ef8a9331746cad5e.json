{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (52.5, -84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and another at (-18.0, -70.0) for smelting iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport at Position (-23.5, -69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) and a Belt Group for transporting copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport at Position (-14.5, -54.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) with a Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) and a Belt Group for transporting iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) with a Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) with a Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Groups\n- Multiple Belt Groups are present for transporting materials between various positions, including positions such as (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5), (-21.5, -67.5) to (-21.5, -69.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connections\n- Ensure that transport belts are placed without gaps to facilitate proper connection between entities. Check the alignment and continuity of belts at positions like (-20.5, -67.5) to (-21.5, -66.5) to avoid gaps.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters contain the necessary items to be moved. This can prevent the inserter from being in a waiting state, as seen with the burner inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5).\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation and avoid downtime, as seen with the burner mining drill at position (53.0, -83.0).\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt Warnings\n- Ensure that furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt to avoid idle time. This is observed with furnaces at positions (-20.0, -70.0), (-18.0, -70.0), and others."}
