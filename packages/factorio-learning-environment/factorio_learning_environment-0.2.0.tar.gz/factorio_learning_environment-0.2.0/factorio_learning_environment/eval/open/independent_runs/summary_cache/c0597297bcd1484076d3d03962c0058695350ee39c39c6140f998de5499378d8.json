{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Ore Mining Section**:\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) for extracting iron ore.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -48.5) for collecting iron ore.\n- **Smelting Section**:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - The furnace is fueled by coal and receives iron ore from the mining drill.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Coal Mining Section**:\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -79.5) for collecting coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Ensure that the item you are trying to insert is available in your inventory. For example, attempting to insert coal when none is available will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to lack of space in destination\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the destination entity to receive items. The Iron Ore Burner Mining Drill frequently reports being \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\", indicating a blockage in the output path.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for the operation of entities like furnaces. The Stone Furnace reported being \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" when it lacked necessary inputs.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. \n  - Failure Mode: Fails if the item is not present in the inventory or if the target entity cannot accept the item.\n  - Success Mode: Successfully inserts the item if conditions are met.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **inventory**: A dictionary representing the current inventory of items, such as `{'coal': 1, 'iron-ore': 2, 'iron-plate': 12}`."}
