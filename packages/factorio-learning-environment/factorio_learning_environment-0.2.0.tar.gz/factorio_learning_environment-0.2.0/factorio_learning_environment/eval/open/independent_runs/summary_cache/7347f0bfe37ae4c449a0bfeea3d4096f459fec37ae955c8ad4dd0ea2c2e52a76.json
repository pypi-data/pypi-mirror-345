The agent made several attempts to deploy a Lab supply structure at Position (0.5, 2.5) \u2013 a facility intended to receive and distribute Automation Science Packs for research \u2013 but none were placed due to inventory shortages and resource deficits. (Other processing units such as furnaces used for smelting were referenced for production purposes but were preexisting rather than constructed by the agent in this cycle.)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Errors with get_entities\n  \u2013 Incorrect invocation led to errors such as \u201cgot an unexpected keyword argument \u2018radius\u2019\u201d and \u201ctakes 0 positional arguments but 3 were given.\u201d\n  \u2013 Tip: Always verify the API signature before calling get_entities, ensuring that only supported keywords and the correct number of positional arguments are used.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Verification\n  \u2013 Attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed with messages indicating \u201cNo lab in inventory.\u201d\n  \u2013 Tip: Confirm the availability of required structure components in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages\n  \u2013 Multiple crafting errors occurred when trying to produce a Lab, with failures citing missing sub-ingredients such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables.\n  \u2013 Tip: Ensure that all intermediary ingredients and prerequisites for Lab production are sufficiently stocked prior to initiating the crafting process.\n\n\u2022 Handling None Returns in Entity Collection\n  \u2013 An error (\u201cNoneType object is not iterable\u201d) was encountered when iterating over lab entities returned by get_entities.\n  \u2013 Tip: Validate that the returned collection is a valid iterable (using an empty list as a fallback if necessary) before performing iterations."}
