{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, actively mining iron ore. The drill is connected to a wooden chest for ore storage.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing mined iron ore. The chest is connected to a burner inserter for transferring ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. The inserter is fueled by coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace is fueled by coal but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning suggests that the setup might not be optimal.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Running out of fuel can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Regularly check and empty the wooden chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can stop the mining drill from operating.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is receiving iron ore from the inserter. Check the inserter setup and the availability of iron ore in the chest to avoid the furnace running without ingredients."}
