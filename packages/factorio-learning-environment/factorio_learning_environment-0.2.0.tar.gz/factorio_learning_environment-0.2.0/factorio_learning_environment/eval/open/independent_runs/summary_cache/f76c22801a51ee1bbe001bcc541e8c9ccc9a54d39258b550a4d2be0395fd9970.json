{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Line at y=0.0\nConsists of four stone furnaces in a row with automated input for the first furnace:\n- Furnace at x=0.0 (working, contains 22 coal and 2 iron ore, 13 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=-1.5 y=0.5 for coal input from wooden chest at x=-2.5 y=0.5 (20 coal)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=0.5 y=-1.5 for ore input from wooden chest at x=0.5 y=-2.5 (11 iron ore)\n- Furnace at x=2.0 (idle, contains 23 coal, 7 iron plates)\n- Furnace at x=4.0 (idle, contains 23 coal, 15 iron plates)\n- Furnace at x=6.0 (idle, contains 23 coal, 15 iron plates)\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Resource availability errors\n- Check inventory for required resources before attempting to insert items into entities\n- Ensure you have both fuel (coal) and raw materials (ore) before setting up multiple furnaces\n- Consider harvesting more resources when inventory is depleted instead of continuing to place empty structures\n\n### Furnace efficiency\n- Avoid placing furnaces without having resources ready to fuel and supply them\n- Set up furnaces one at a time, ensuring each is properly supplied before moving to the next one\n- When extracting products from furnaces, immediately resupply them with raw materials to maintain continuous production\n- Monitor furnace warnings like 'no ingredients to smelt' and address them promptly to maintain production efficiency\n\n### Inserter setup errors\n- Ensure there is a valid destination entity for inserters before activating them\n- Current inserters are showing \"output blocked by item on the ground\" warnings\n- Verify inserter drop positions align with valid input slots on destination entities\n\n### Automation design\n- When setting up automated input systems, ensure the complete input-output chain is configured\n- Consider setting up output collection systems alongside input automation\n- Test automation with small quantities before scaling up\n\n### Entity placement and retrieval errors\n- Verify that an entity exists at a position before attempting to interact with it\n- When trying to get an entity (like wooden chest), ensure it has been placed first\n- Double check coordinates when attempting to interact with entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in inventory before attempting to place entities\n\n### Resource gathering and crafting\n- Before attempting to craft items, check if the required materials are raw resources that need to be gathered (like wood)\n- Verify recipe requirements and gather all necessary raw materials before starting crafting operations\n- Check if a recipe exists and is enabled before attempting to craft items"}
