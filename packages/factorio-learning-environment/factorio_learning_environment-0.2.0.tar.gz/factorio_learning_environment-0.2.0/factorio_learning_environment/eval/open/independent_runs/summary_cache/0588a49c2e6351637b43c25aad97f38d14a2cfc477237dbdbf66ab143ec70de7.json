{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Incomplete Electricity Generation Setup near Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nThis setup is designed to generate electricity but is currently non-functional because the Boiler lacks fuel. The exact components and their positions are not detailed in the logs, but it likely involves an offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Non-functional Power Setup Halting Progress\n*   The agent is unable to proceed due to the non-functional electricity generation setup. The Boiler requires fuel to operate, but the agent cannot currently automate the fueling process due to placement limitations. The power system must be made operational (e.g., by manually fueling the boiler if automation is not feasible) before further progress can be made."}
