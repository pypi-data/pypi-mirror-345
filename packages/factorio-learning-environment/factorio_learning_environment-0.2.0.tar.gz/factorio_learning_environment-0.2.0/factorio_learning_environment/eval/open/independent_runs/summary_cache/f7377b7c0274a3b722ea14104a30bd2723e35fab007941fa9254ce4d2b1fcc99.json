{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a wooden chest at position (-15.5, -48.5) and another wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5). The drill is currently out of fuel.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) with a drop position at (-12.5, -48.5), waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) with a full output of iron plates and a source inventory of iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) actively producing iron plates with a source inventory of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, with a drop position at (-14.5, -46.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, with a drop position at (-9.5, -47.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -47.5) containing iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) empty.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) containing iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not full to allow continuous operation. Regularly transfer items from destination chests or furnaces to avoid blockages.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source for inserters has available items. Regularly check and refill the source inventories to maintain a steady production flow.\n\n### Out of Fuel for Mining Drill\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as needed to avoid production halts.\n\n### Error in Item Insertion\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to insert them into entities. Keep track of inventory levels and gather resources as required to prevent such errors."}
