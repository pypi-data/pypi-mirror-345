{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: 2 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This error was encountered multiple times with Transport Belts, Wooden Chests, and Burner Inserters.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Verify that the target location is valid and unoccupied before moving an entity. This error was encountered with Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This error was encountered when trying to get a Stone Furnace at a specific position.\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity. This error was encountered when trying to insert coal into a drill without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Warnings related to entity operation\n- Address warnings such as \"output blocked by item on the ground\" by ensuring there is a sink entity to accept the output from drills or other production facilities.\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning."}
