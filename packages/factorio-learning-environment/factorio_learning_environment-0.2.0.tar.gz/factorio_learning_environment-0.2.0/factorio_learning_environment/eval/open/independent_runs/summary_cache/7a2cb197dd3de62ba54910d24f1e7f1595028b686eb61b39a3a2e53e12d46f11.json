{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is currently fueled with coal and has a working status.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) which transfers iron plates from the stone furnace to a wooden chest. It is fueled with coal and is currently operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) used to store iron plates. The chest currently contains 16 iron plates.\n\n### Additional Inserter\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=4.5, y=0.5) intended to transfer items from a belt to a chest. It is fueled with coal but is currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is unoccupied. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities such as wooden chests or items on the ground.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to non-compatible entities\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to a wooden chest. Use an inserter to transfer items from belts to chests.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory for crafting or placement\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to craft or place entities. For example, ensure you have enough iron plates to craft transport belts or a burner inserter available for placement.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines or furnaces. For example, iron ore must be present in your inventory to insert into a furnace."}
