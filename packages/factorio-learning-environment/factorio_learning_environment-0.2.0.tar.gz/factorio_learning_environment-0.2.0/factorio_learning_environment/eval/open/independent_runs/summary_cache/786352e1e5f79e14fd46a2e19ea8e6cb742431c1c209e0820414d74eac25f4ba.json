For example, iron plates are necessary for crafting pipes, and you need to smelt iron ore in a furnace to produce them.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it."}
