{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. The logs indicate that all attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities currently present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placing the desired entity. The repeated error messages \"Cannot place [entity] at x=[value] y=[value].\" suggest that the agent is attempting to place entities on occupied or invalid tiles.\n\n### Errors with movement functions\n- When using movement functions, ensure that the correct data types are used. The error \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" indicates a misuse of string indices in movement-related functions.\n- The error \"'Position' object is not callable\" suggests that there might be an incorrect attempt to call a 'Position' object as if it were a function. Ensure that the correct syntax and method calls are used when dealing with position objects.\n\n### Errors with building area determination\n- When determining a buildable area, ensure that the parameters are correctly set. The error \"No viable place to put Prototype.WoodenChest near the centre position with this BuildingBox size found on the map\" indicates that the specified building area is either too large or incorrectly defined. Consider using smaller or multiple building boxes to find a suitable area for placement."}
