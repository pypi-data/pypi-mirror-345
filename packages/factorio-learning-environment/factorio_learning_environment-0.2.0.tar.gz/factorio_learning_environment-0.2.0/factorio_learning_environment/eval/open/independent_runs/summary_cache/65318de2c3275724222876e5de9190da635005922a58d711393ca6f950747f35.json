{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Boiler at position (0.0, 4.5) - Currently operational with full output\n- Steam engine at position (6.5, 4.5) - Not yet connected properly\n- Offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) - Working and providing water\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting the system:\n  - Water input pipe group at (-1.5, 3.5)\n  - Empty pipe groups at (7.5, 2.5) and (4.5, 5.5)\n- Inserter for fuel at (0.5, 2.5)\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\n- Input storage chest at (8.5, 1.5) containing iron plates, copper plates and iron gear wheels\n- Inserter at (9.5, 1.5) to feed materials\n- Assembling machine at (11.5, 1.5) for crafting automation science packs\n- Output inserter at (13.5, 1.5)\n- Output storage chest at (14.5, 1.5) containing automation science packs\n\n### Smelting Area\n- Three furnaces in a row at positions:\n  - (2.0, 0.0)\n  - (5.0, 0.0)\n  - (8.0, 0.0)\n- Additional furnace at (1.0, 2.0)\n- Burner inserter at (3.5, 0.5)\n- Storage chest at (4.5, 1.5)\n\n### Research Area\n- Multiple labs connected to electricity network (currently unpowered)\n- Some labs contain automation science packs:\n  - Lab 1: 56 packs\n  - Lab 3: 110 packs\n  - Lab 4: 31 packs\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups for material transport:\n- Belt system from (0.5, 1.5) to (-3.5, 6.5)\n- Belt system connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) and (4.5, 5.5)\n- Additional belt networks for material distribution\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Steam Engine Placement Issues\n- Ensure there is adequate clear space before placing steam engines\n- Check for existing entities in the target location\n- Steam engines require a 3x5 tile area for placement\n\n### Power Connection Problems\n- Cannot craft electric poles due to missing wood resource\n- Wood is a raw resource that must be gathered, not crafted\n- Ensure power network is properly connected before expecting machines to work\n\n### Pipe Connection Issues\n- Steam engines must be properly connected to boilers with pipes\n- Remove empty pipe groups before creating new connections\n- Ensure direct pipe connections between boiler output and steam engine input\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Many entities showing NO_POWER status due to incomplete power network\n- Inserters and assembling machines cannot function without power\n- Ensure fuel supply (coal) is maintained in the boiler\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure proper fuel supply for burner inserters\n- Keep track of raw material requirements for crafting operations\n- Monitor input/output chest contents for production flow"}
