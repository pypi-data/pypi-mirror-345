Regularly monitor and manage the inventory in chests to prevent them from becoming full.\n\n### Errors when redistributing resources\n- Verify that the target destination for resource redistribution is not full and is capable of accepting the resources. Check the inventory levels and manage them accordingly.\n\n### Errors when managing furnace operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check the furnace source inventory to ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Errors when managing coal and iron ore inventories\n- Confirm that the target chests for coal and iron ore management exist and have available space. Avoid attempting to extract from or insert into non-existent or full chests."}
