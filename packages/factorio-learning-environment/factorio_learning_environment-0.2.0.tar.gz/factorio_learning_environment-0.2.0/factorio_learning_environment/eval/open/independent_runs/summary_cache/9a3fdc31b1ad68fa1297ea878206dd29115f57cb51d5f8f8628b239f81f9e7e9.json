The logs indicate attempts to place entities, but none have been successfully placed due to errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Verify that the target position is clear and not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities at specific coordinates\n- Double-check the coordinates before placing an entity to ensure the position is valid and clear for placement.\n- Avoid attempting to place entities at positions that are already occupied or invalid, such as negative coordinates or coordinates outside the map bounds.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
