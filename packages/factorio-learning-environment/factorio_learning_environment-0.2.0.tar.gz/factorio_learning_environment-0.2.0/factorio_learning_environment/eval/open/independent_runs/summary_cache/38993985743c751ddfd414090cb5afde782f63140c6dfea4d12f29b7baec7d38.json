{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been created on the map as of the current steps. The agent has attempted to place entities but has not successfully established any structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. The agent encountered multiple errors when trying to place a Wooden Chest and a Stone Furnace at various positions (e.g., x=200.0, y=200.0; x=10.5, y=10.5; x=150.0, y=-250.0).\n\n### Errors due to obstacles\n- Conduct a thorough scan of the area to identify obstacles before placing entities. The agent encountered obstacles at multiple positions (e.g., Position(x=145.0, y=145.0) to Position(x=155.0, y=155.0)).\n\n### Errors in movement commands\n- Ensure that the indices used in movement commands are integers. The agent encountered an error when attempting to move due to incorrect index types (e.g., \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'\").\n\n### General placement issues\n- Verify that the placement coordinates are valid and accessible. The agent faced issues placing entities at various coordinates, indicating potential problems with the chosen positions."}
