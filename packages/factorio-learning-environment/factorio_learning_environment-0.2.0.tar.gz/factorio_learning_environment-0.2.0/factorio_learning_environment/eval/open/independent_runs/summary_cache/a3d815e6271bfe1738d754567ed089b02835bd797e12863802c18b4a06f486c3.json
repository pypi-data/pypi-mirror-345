{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5). This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=-18.5, y=-48.5), (x=-16.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=41.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), (x=44.5, y=-80.5), (x=45.5, y=-80.5), (x=47.5, y=-80.5), and (x=49.5, y=-80.5) used for storing coal.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=43.5, y=-80.5) for transferring coal between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=42.5, y=-80.5) and (x=44.5, y=-80.5) used for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from mining drills\n- Ensure that the mining drill's output is clear before attempting to extract. If the chest at the drop position is full, empty it to continue mining.\n\n### Errors when inserting iron ore into furnaces\n- Verify that there is iron ore available in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces. Make sure to transfer iron ore from storage to your inventory if needed.\n\n### Errors when transferring to non-existent entities\n- Double-check the positions of entities before attempting to transfer items. Ensure that the target entity exists at the specified position to avoid transfer errors.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure that the entities are properly refueled by maintaining a sufficient supply of fuel (e.g., coal) in your inventory."}
