{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore. Currently working with fuel (coal).\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently working with fuel (coal).\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace. Recently picked up and replaced to clear blockage.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace. Out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest. Out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt. Out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n- Transport belt at position (21.5, 73.5) moving iron plates away from the chest. Belt is working but has no inventory (empty).\n\nThe structure forms a connected iron plate production line from ore extraction to plate output onto a belt. Fuel (coal) has been inserted into all burner entities recently to resume operation. Some inserters remain out of fuel and blocked waiting for source items. The wooden chest was temporarily removed and replaced to clear blockages.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel management for burner entities\n- Burner inserters and furnaces require continuous fuel supply to operate. Running out of fuel causes them to stop working and block production flow.\n- Ensure coal or other fuel items are consistently inserted into burner inserters, furnaces, and drills. Track inventory carefully and insert fuel promptly.\n- Avoid attempting to insert fuel when inventory is empty, as this causes exceptions. Confirm inventory contains coal before insertion commands.\n\n### Handling item insertion errors due to empty inventory\n- Multiple errors occurred when trying to insert coal into entities while inventory was empty. Always check inventory before attempting to insert items.\n- Implement inventory checks or conditional logic to prevent insertion calls when no fuel is available.\n\n### Placement conflicts and spacing adjustments\n- Placement of burner inserters next to the furnace or wooden chest failed due to occupied tiles. Increasing spacing or changing placement direction can resolve this.\n- Transport belt placement near inserters failed due to existing belts occupying the tile. Consider increasing spacing or repositioning reference points.\n- Removing and replacing entities (e.g., wooden chest) can help clear blockages caused by placement conflicts.\n\n### Inventory inspection on transport belts\n- Attempts to inspect inventory of transport belts resulted in exceptions due to belts having empty inventories or being terminus belts with no internal inventory.\n- Avoid inspecting inventories of transport belts directly; instead, monitor upstream/downstream entities or use alternative methods to track item flow.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
