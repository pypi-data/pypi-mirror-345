{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into a wooden chest. Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore. Currently contains 15 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. Refueled with coal but often misaligned, causing the furnace to not receive iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. Regularly check and adjust the inserter's position to ensure proper operation.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel the burner mining drill and inserter to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish coal as needed to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Regularly extract iron ore from the wooden chest to prevent overflow and ensure the mining drill can continue operation. Consider expanding storage capacity if the chest frequently becomes full.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Ensure the burner inserter is correctly positioned and operational to provide a continuous supply of iron ore to the stone furnace. Check for any blockages or misalignments that may prevent the transfer of materials."}
