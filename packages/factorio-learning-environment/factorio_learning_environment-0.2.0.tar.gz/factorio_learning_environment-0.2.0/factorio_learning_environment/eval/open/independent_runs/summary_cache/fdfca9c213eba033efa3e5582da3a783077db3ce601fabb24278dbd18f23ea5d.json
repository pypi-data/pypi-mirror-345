{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transportation System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the chest to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) receiving coal from the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal to another storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5) for coal transportation.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using stale entity data\n- Ensure that the entity data is up-to-date before performing any operations. Stale data can lead to incorrect actions and inefficient resource management.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be resolved by ensuring the supply chain is continuous and not interrupted.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without checking tile availability\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type being placed. This prevents placement errors and optimizes space usage."}
