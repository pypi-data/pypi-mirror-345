There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (2 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (42 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place entities such as Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting to access them. For example, ensure that a Stone Furnace exists at the specified position before calling `get_entity`.\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept outputs from drills or other production entities to prevent blockage and warnings."}
