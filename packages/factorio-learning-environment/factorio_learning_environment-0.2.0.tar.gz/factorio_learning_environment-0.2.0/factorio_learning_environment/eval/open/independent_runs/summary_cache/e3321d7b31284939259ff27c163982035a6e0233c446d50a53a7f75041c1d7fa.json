{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with coal as fuel. It is currently operational and extracting iron ore. The drill is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores extracted iron ore. This chest has a warning indicating it is full.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) which is used to increase storage capacity.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled by coal and currently operational.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which is used to transfer items between chests. It is fueled by coal and currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free from other entities before attempting to place a new entity. If a placement fails due to an occupied tile, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full. Empty or expand storage as needed to ensure continuous operation of connected entities like mining drills."}
