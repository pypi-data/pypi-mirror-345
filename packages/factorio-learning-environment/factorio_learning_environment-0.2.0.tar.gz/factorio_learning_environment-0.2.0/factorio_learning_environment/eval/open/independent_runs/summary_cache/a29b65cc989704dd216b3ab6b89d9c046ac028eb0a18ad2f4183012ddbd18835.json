{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1**: Stone furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), producing iron plates. It is fueled by coal and currently has a source inventory of iron ore.\n- **Furnace 2**: Stone furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), producing iron plates. It is fueled by coal and currently has a full output inventory of iron plates.\n- **Inserters**: \n  - Inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) waiting for space in destination.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring materials between entities.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring materials between entities.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: Positioned at (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), extracting iron ore. It is fueled by coal.\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted resources.\n  - Additional storage chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Material Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Positioned at (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), facilitating the transfer of materials between the mining drill, furnaces, and storage chests.\n  - Positioned at (x=-11.5, y=-45.5), waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters with full destination\n- Ensure that the destination of an inserter has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred. Regularly monitor and clear the destination to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without available inventory\n- Before attempting to place an entity, verify that the required item is available in your inventory. This will prevent placement errors due to missing items.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to maintain smooth operation."}
