{"content": "The error you encountered indicates that the attempt to harvest copper ore failed because there was \"Nothing within reach to harvest.\" This suggests that the position you specified may not have been valid for harvesting, or there might not have been any copper ore available at that location.\n\n### Tips to Avoid This Error in the Future:\n\n1. **Verify Resource Location**: Before attempting to harvest, ensure that you are indeed positioned over a valid resource patch. Use functions to check for nearby resources and their availability.\n\n2. **Use `nearest()` Function**: Instead of hardcoding the position, utilize the `nearest(Resource.CopperOre)` function to dynamically find the closest copper ore patch. This will ensure you are targeting a valid resource.\n\n3. **Check Resource Availability**: After moving to the resource patch, inspect the area to confirm that there is enough copper ore available to harvest. You can use functions to query the resource patch size or availability.\n\n4. **Adjust Positioning**: If you are unsure about the exact coordinates, consider using a helper function to find a valid buildable position or to ensure you are within the bounds of the resource patch.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to gracefully manage situations where harvesting fails. This can include retrying the harvest or providing a fallback action.\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve your interactions with resource harvesting and reduce the likelihood of encountering similar errors in the future.", "summary_range": "[1-162]"}
