{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-3.5, y=26.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=-3.5, y=26.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=35.5, y=27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes placed at various positions along the line (e.g., x=-2.0 to x=34.0, y=23.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with iron plates in the result inventory.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=13.0, y=0.0) with iron plates in the result inventory.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=16.0, y=0.0) with iron plates in the result inventory.\n- Burner Inserters positioned to move items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Storage and Handling\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions such as (x=8.5, y=-0.5), (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), (x=20.5, y=-0.5), and others.\n- Burner Inserters positioned to handle items between chests and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that there is a clear path for pipes to connect the boiler to the steam engine. Check for any obstructions that might block the placement of pipes.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Verify that the target location for placing pipes is free from existing objects. Clear any obstructions before attempting to place pipes.\n- Avoid placing pipes in areas with unplaceable terrain, such as water.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Working\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and has input liquid (steam) available. Check all connections and fluid boxes for issues.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. Check the connected chests and furnaces for availability of items to be moved."}
