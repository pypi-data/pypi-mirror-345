{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position: -9.5, -0.5) - working (water: 100, temp: 15\u00b0C)\n- Boiler (position: -6.0, 1.5) - out of fuel warning (water: 200, temp: 15\u00b0C)\n- Steam engine (position: -1.5, 4.5) - not connected to power network\n- Pipe network (3 pipes from pump to boiler, 4 pipes from boiler to engine)\n\n### Iron Production Line at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position: 15.5, 70.5) - no power, chest full warning (38 iron ore in output)\n- Wooden chest (position: 15.5, 72.5) - contains 38 iron ore\n- Stone furnace (position: 16.0, 74.0) - working with 49 coal, contains 2 iron ore and 18 iron plates\n- 3 Inserters (positions: 16.5,72.5; 17.5,74.5; 18.5,74.5) - all without power\n- Assembling machine 2 (position: 21.5, 74.5) - no power, missing iron plates for gear production\n- Output chest (position: 19.5, 74.5) - empty\n- Small electric poles providing power coverage (though currently not functioning)\n\n### New Electricity Groups\nMultiple disconnected electricity groups detected at:\n- (30.5,32.5) with 3 poles\n- (50.5,54.5) with 1 pole\n- (100.5,104.5) with 1 pole\n- (150.5,154.5) with 2 poles\n- (200.5,204.5) with 1 pole\n- (300.5,300.5) with 2 poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Errors (12 new instances)\n- Occupied tiles: Verify tile is empty before placing (occurred at (198.5,200.5), (298.5,300.5), (20.5,74.5))\n- Water placement: Check terrain type before placing (electric mining drills in water)\n- Distance limitations: Move within 10 tiles before placing (occurred at (20.5,70.5) and (300.5,300.5))\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Boiler fuel depletion: Still not addressed (now at 48 coal remaining)\n- Electrical network: Steam engine still not connected to power network\n- Production halted: All electric devices remain without power\n\n### Area Clearing Problems (4 new instances)\n- Failed assertions: \"Area not cleared properly\" errors when trying to build\n- Entity removal: Failed to remove stone furnace at (16.0,74.0) and electricity group at (20.5,70.125)\n\n### Code Execution Errors\n- Missing imports: 'math' module not imported before use\n- Position validation: Assertions failing due to uncleared areas\n\n### Production Chain Issues\n- Iron ore backlog: Chest at (15.5,72.5) still full with 38 ore\n- Assembler starvation: No progress on gear production\n- Resource imbalance: 21 iron plates now accumulated in furnace\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `find_empty_position()` -> Position: Attempts to find an empty position for placement (failed due to uncleared areas)\n- `clear_area(position: Position, radius: float)` -> bool: Tries to clear area before building (failed assertions in multiple cases)\n\n### Important Variables\n- `entities_remaining: List[Entity]` - Tracks uncleared entities\n- `empty_pos: Position` - Stores found empty positions (when successful)"}
