{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mining Structure at position (41, -82)\nConsists of a burner-mining-drill at position (41, -82) with a fuel inventory of 50 coal, and two wooden chests at positions (40.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -83.5) with coal inventories of 800 and 435 respectively.\n\n### Coal Transportation Structure\nConsists of a burner-inserter at position (39.5, -81.5) with a fuel inventory of 15 coal, connected to the coal mining structure.\n\n### Furnace Structure at position (0, 0)\nConsists of a stone-furnace at position (0, 0) with a fuel inventory of 50 coal.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when inserting coal into a full burner-mining-drill**: Make sure the drill's inventory is not full before attempting to insert coal. Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining.\n* **Errors when extracting coal from a chest**: Ensure that the chest is not empty and that the extraction quantity is valid.\n* **Errors due to full fuel source**: Make sure to empty the fuel source of the furnace and the burner-mining-drill to avoid errors.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* **Utility functions**: None\n* **Important variables**:\n  + `coal_chest`: a wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with a coal inventory of 800\n  + `iron_chest`: a wooden chest at position (41.5, -83.5) with a coal inventory of 435\n  + `drill`: a burner-mining-drill at position (41, -82) with a fuel inventory of 50 coal\n  + `inserter`: a burner-inserter at position (39.5, -81.5) with a fuel inventory of 15 coal\n  + `furnace`: a stone-furnace at position (0, 0) with a fuel inventory of 50 coal"}
