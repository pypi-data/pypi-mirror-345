{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-17.0, y=-52.0)  \n- Wooden chest (position x=-16.5, y=-50.5)  \n- Burner inserter (position x=-17.5, y=-50.5)  \n\n#### Smelting Setup at position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position x=-15.0, y=-51.0)  \n- Burner inserter (position x=-14.5, y=-52.5)  \n- Wooden chest (position x=-13.5, y=-51.5)  \n\n#### Additional Smelting Setup at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position x=-13.0, y=-50.0)  \n- Burner inserter (position x=-11.5, y=-50.5)  \n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to retrieve a non-existent entity\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. For example, verify the presence of a wooden chest at (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) before calling `get_entity`.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace without the required resources\n- Check your inventory for the necessary items (e.g., iron ore) before attempting to insert them into a furnace.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a mining drill without resources\n- Ensure the mining drill has extracted resources (e.g., iron ore) before attempting to extract them. Verify the drill's status and inventory.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are out of fuel\n- Always ensure mining drills have sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) to operate. Refuel them when necessary.\n\n#### Errors when chests at drop positions are full\n- Empty chests at drop positions (e.g., x=-16.5, y=-50.5) to allow mining drills to continue operating.\n\n#### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items or space in destination\n- Ensure inserters have access to source items and that their destination (e.g., furnaces or chests) has space to receive items."}
