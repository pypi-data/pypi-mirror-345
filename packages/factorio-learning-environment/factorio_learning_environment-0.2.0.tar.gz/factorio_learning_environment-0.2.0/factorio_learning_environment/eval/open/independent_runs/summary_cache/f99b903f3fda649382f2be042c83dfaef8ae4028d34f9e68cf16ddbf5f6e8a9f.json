{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0), currently working with a fuel inventory of coal and processing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5), facing UP, with a pickup position at (-9.5, -47.5) and a drop position at (-9.5, -49.5). It is currently waiting for space in the destination and is connected to the stone furnace.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT, with 5 belts.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5), direction LEFT, with 10 belts.\n\n### Coal Supply System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -53.5), facing UP, with a pickup position at (-15.5, -52.5) and a drop position at (-15.5, -54.5). It is currently out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -52.5), facing LEFT, with a pickup position at (-12.5, -52.5) and a drop position at (-14.5, -52.5). It is currently out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with connecting belts directly to a furnace\n- Use an inserter to connect belts to a furnace, as belts cannot be directly connected to a Prototype.StoneFurnace object.\n\n### Errors with crafting due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Ensure all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates are needed for crafting transport belts and must be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors with finding a suitable position for the burner inserter\n- Verify that there is enough space and the correct orientation for placing a burner inserter. Adjust the position or remove obstacles if necessary.\n\n### AttributeError with 'Position' object\n- Ensure that the correct attributes and methods are used for position objects. Double-check the API documentation for the correct usage of position attributes."}
