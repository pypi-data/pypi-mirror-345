{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -25.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid, rendering it non-operational. The boiler is also not operational due to being disconnected.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Iron plate mine at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with boiler and steam engine connections\n- Ensure that the boiler is connected to a suitable pipe group to allow for fluid transfer. Verify the connections before attempting to operate the boiler.\n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that there is a continuous supply of water for it to function.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with power supply to entities\n- Check the connections of small electric poles to ensure that all machines, including labs and assembling machines, are receiving the required power."}
