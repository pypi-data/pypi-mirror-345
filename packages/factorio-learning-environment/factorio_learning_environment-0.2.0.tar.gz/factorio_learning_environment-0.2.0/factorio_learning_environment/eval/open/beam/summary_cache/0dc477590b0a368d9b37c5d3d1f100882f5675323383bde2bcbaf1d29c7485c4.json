{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n#### Electricity generator at position(0,0)\nConsists of steam engine(position (0,1)), boiler(position (0,2)) and offshore pump (position (0,3))\n\n#### Copper plate mine at position(1,0)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position (1,1)) and a furnace at position (1,2)\n- Burner mining drill (position (1,3)) and a furnace at position (1,4)\n- Burner mining drill (position (1,5)) and a furnace at position (1,6)\n\n#### Copper cable factory at position(2,0)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position (2,1)) and a furnace at position (2,2)\n- Assembling machine at position (2,3) and inserter at position (2,4) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position (2,5)) that connects the furnace at position (2,2) to assembling machine at position (2,3)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when attempting to harvest resources\n- Ensure you are within reach of the resource patch before attempting to harvest. Move closer to the resource patch if necessary.\n\n### Errors related to missing entities in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to craft or place entities. Check your inventory for the necessary resources.\n\n### Errors when trying to use unavailable resources\n- Verify that you have enough resources to craft the required items. If you lack the necessary materials, gather them before attempting to craft or build.\n- Confirm the existence of the resource patch at the specified location before attempting to access it. Use the correct coordinates and ensure the resource is available. Multiple attempts to access iron ore at various coordinates have failed due to non-existence.\n\n### Errors when moving to a new position\n- Ensure that the position you are trying to move to is valid and that the movement command is correctly formatted. Check for any syntax errors in your movement commands.\n- Ensure you can request a path to the target position. If the path request fails, check the coordinates and ensure they are valid.\n- Check for any issues with the movement command syntax, as errors indicate that string indices must be integers.\n- Ensure that the target position for movement is reachable and that the pathfinding system is functioning correctly.\n- Address the issue where the pathfinding system fails to find a path, as indicated by errors stating \"Could not request path\" with nil values.\n\n### Errors related to TypeError\n- Review the code for any instances where a float is being called as a function. Ensure that all function calls are correctly formatted and that variables are being used appropriately."}
