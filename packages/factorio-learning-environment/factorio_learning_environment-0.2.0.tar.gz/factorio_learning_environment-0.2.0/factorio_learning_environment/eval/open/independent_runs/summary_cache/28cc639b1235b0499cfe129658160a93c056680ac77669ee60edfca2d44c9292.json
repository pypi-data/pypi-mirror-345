{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Storage chest (x=23.5, y=-16.5)\nMining coal with current storage of 133 coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Storage chest (x=-14.5, y=21.5)\nMining iron ore with current storage of 647 iron ore\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (-10.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces (x=-11.0, y=20.0 and x=-9.0, y=20.0)\nCurrently not active due to lack of ingredients\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (22.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=20.0, y=20.0) dropping to input chest (x=20.5, y=21.5)\n- Middle storage chest (x=22.5, y=21.5) containing 421 copper ore\n- Stone furnace (x=24.0, y=20.0)\n- Output chest (x=24.5, y=17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Input inserter (x=22.5, y=20.5) moving items from middle chest to furnace\n- Output inserter (x=24.5, y=18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Inserter Placement and Configuration\n- When placing inserters, ensure the pickup and drop positions align with the source and target entities\n- Double-check inserter orientation (direction) to ensure proper material flow\n- Verify that inserters can reach both their pickup and drop positions\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients\" warnings despite available resources nearby indicates potential inserter positioning or configuration issues\n- When furnaces show \"fuel source is full\" warning, no more fuel should be added\n\n### Entity Placement Coordination\n- When building processing lines, plan the relative positions of entities (mining drills, chests, inserters, furnaces) to ensure they can interact properly\n- Consider the tile dimensions of entities when planning layouts (e.g., furnaces are 2x2 tiles, chests are 1x1)"}
