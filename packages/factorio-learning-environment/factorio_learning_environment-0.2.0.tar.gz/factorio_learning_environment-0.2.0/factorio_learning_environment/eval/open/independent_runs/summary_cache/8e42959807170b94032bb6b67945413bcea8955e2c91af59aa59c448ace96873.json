{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) which is extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) transferring coal from the drill to a collection point.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to collect coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) which is smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- The furnace is currently full with iron plates, indicating production is ongoing but output is blocked.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure the intended position for placing entities such as Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters is clear of other objects. Check for existing entities that might block placement.\n\n### Errors with Dimensions and Positioning\n- Verify the dimensions and positions when defining or placing entities. Ensure that the correct data types are used for dimensions and positions to avoid TypeErrors.\n\n### Errors with Entity Alignment\n- When aligning entities like inserters to match the drop position of drills or other entities, ensure that the positions are correctly calculated and that there is space available for the realignment.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or a clear path for the output of drills and furnaces to prevent blockage. Regularly check and clear any items blocking the output path.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Burner Inserters to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that fuel is available in the inventory and is being transferred correctly to the entities."}
