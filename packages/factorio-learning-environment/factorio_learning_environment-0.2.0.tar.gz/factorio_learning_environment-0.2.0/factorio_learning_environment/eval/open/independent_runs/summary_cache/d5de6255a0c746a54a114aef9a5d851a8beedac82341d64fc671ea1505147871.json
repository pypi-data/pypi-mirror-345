{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore\n\n#### Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (52.0, -79.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (53.5, -79.5) for moving items into the furnace\n- Chest at position (54.5, -79.5) for storing smelted iron plates\n\n#### Coal Storage at position (43.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Chest at position (43.5, -80.5) for storing coal\n- Burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) for moving items between chests\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full chest\n- Ensure the chest at the drop position has enough space before inserting items. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without ingredients\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients before attempting to smelt. Insert iron ore into the furnace at (52.0, -79.0) to start smelting.\n\n#### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure the source chest has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the chest at (41.5, -80.5) for items to be moved.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Variables\n- `transport-belt`: int\n- `burner-mining-drill`: int\n- `stone-furnace`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int"}
