{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position(-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -49.0) which is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Current status: NO_FUEL, with 3 iron ore in source inventory and 70 iron plates in result inventory.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at position(42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position(42.0, -83.0), fueled with coal and currently working. It has a warning indicating that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, and there is no sink entity to accept the output.\n- Burner Inserter at position(42.5, -81.5), fueled with coal and waiting for source items. It has a warning that the chest is full.\n- BeltGroup consisting of:\n  - Transport Belt from position(42.5, -82.5) to position(44.5, -82.5) moving in the RIGHT direction.\n  - Transport Belt from position(43.5, -81.5) to position(43.5, -79.5) moving in the DOWN direction.\n  - Transport Belt from position(43.5, -80.5) to position(42.5, -79.5) moving in the LEFT direction.\n  - Total of 7 belts in the group, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chest\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing a Wooden Chest is not occupied by another entity or obstruction. Clear any obstructions before attempting to place the chest.\n\n### Errors when extending transport belt\n- Verify that the intended position for extending the transport belt is clear and not obstructed by other entities. Adjust the layout to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors when reconnecting transport belt\n- Ensure that the transport belt path is continuous and properly aligned with existing belts. Check for any misalignments or gaps before reconnecting.\n\n### Furnace out of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of the Stone Furnace and ensure it is refueled to maintain continuous operation. Consider automating the refueling process to prevent downtime."}
