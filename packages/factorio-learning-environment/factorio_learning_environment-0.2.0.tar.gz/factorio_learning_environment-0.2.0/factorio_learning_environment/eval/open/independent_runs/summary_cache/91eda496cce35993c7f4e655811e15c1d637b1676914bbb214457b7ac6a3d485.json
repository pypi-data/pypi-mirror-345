{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 25.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-0.5, 25.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status WORKING\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and others\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (15.0, 0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- **Inserters** at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) with status NO_POWER\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at positions such as (16.5, 8.5), (15.5, 2.5), and others\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Pipe Group** with fluid system 21565, status EMPTY, with pipes at positions such as (-1.5, 17.5), (-0.5, 17.5), and others\n- **Pipe Group** with fluid system 21569, status FULL_OUTPUT, with pipes at positions such as (-8.5, 20.5), (-8.5, 21.5), and others\n- **Pipe Group** with fluid system 21578, status EMPTY, with pipes at positions such as (-7.5, 25.5), (-7.5, 24.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there are no existing entities at the target position before placing a pipe. Clear the area if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Pipe-to-Ground Placement\n- Verify that the target location for pipe-to-ground is free from obstacles or unplaceable terrain such as water before attempting placement.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Check connections between the boiler, steam engine, and pipes to ensure they are properly linked and receiving the necessary input liquids.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Connect inserters to the power network using electric poles to ensure they receive electricity and function correctly."}
