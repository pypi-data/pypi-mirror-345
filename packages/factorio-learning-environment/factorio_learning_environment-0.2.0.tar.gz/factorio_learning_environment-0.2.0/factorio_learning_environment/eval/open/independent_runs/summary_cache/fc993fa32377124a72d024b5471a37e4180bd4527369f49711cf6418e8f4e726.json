{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at position(x=37-41, y=-85/-87)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 3 Burner mining drills at positions (37.0,-85.0), (39.0,-85.0), and (41.0,-86.0)\n- Wooden chests at positions (34.5,-86.5), (36.5,-86.5), (40.5,-87.5), and (39.5,-83.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (35.5,-86.5) and (35.5,-85.5)\nAll drills are currently out of fuel, chests contain varying amounts of coal (208-478 units)\n\n### Mixed Ore Mining & Smelting at position(x=-28, y=-61)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0,-61.0) mining copper and iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0,-58.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5,-59.5) containing mixed ores\n- Burner inserters at (-26.5,-59.5) and (-25.5,-58.5)\n- Output chest at (-24.5,-58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(x=-6 to -10, y=-59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 3 Burner mining drills at (-10.0,-59.0), (-8.0,-59.0), and (-6.0,-59.0)\n- Input chests at (-9.5,-57.5), (-7.5,-57.5), and (-5.5,-57.5)\n- Connected by transport belts and inserters\nCurrently partially blocked due to full chests\n\n### Smelting Array at position(x=0 to 6, y=0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at (0.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), (4.0,0.0), and (6.0,0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), and (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), and (6.5,2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters managing input/output\nConnected to belt system for automated material movement\n\n### Power Generation Complex at position(x=-3.5 to 4.5, y=17-27)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5,27.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5,22.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5,20.5)\n- Connected by pipe network\n- Electric poles extending from (7.5,20.5) to (10.5,12.5)\nCurrently not fully operational due to boiler being out of fuel\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Cannot extract from empty or non-existent chests. Verify chest exists and contains items before attempting extraction\n- Full chest warnings indicate need for better output management. Empty or expand storage capacity when chests reach capacity\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Multiple \"out of fuel\" warnings on mining drills and boiler. Implement consistent fuel distribution system\n- Ensure coal supply chain remains operational by keeping mining drills fueled\n\n### Entity Placement and Connection Issues\n- Steam engine shows \"no input liquid\" warning. Ensure proper pipe connections between boiler and steam engine\n- Verify fluid system connectivity when setting up power generation"}
