{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) moving items from furnace to chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing processed iron plates.\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities for item movement.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) supplied with copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) moving items from furnace to chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) storing processed copper plates.\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities for item movement.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to missing entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. For instance, verify the presence of a wooden chest at position (x=9.5, y=0.5) before attempting to access it.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters are adequately supplied with items to prevent the inserters from stalling."}
