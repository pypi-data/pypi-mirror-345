{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups for water and steam transport\n- Electric pole network connecting various positions\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position(8.5, 13.5)\n- Input inserters:\n  - Iron gear inserter at position(8.5, 11.5)\n  - Copper inserter at position(8.5, 10.5)\n- Storage chests:\n  - Iron gear chest at position(9.5, 10.5)\n  - Copper plate chest at position(11.5, 13.5)\n- Connected by transport belts\n- Stone furnace at position(14.0, 14.0)\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at various locations:\n1. Setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n2. Setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\n3. Setup at (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a position\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and direction to avoid collisions\n- Consider the tile dimensions of entities when planning placement\n\n### Resource Extraction Issues\n- Verify that the target entity contains the required resources before attempting extraction\n- Ensure furnaces are properly fueled and have ingredients before attempting to extract products\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Keep boilers fueled to maintain steam production\n- Ensure proper connection of power poles to maintain electricity network\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- Verify proper orientation and spacing of inserters\n- Ensure input/output positions are correctly aligned with assembling machines and chests\n- Check that transport belts are properly connected and oriented\n\n### Mining Operation Issues\n- Keep mining drills fueled to maintain operation\n- Ensure proper alignment of mining drills with resource patches\n- Maintain fuel supply in burner inserters"}
