Its fluid system identifier has been updated through successive steps (most recently seen as 56875).  \n\u2022 Multiple steam engines installed at (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5) and (4.5, 23.5).  \n\u2022 An extra steam engine remains unplaced due to spatial congestion within the boiler zone.\n\n### Automated Mining Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A burner mining drill located at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) dedicated to resource extraction.  \n\u2022 Burner inserters positioned at (\u201314.5, \u201352.5) and (\u201313.5, \u201352.5) (with an additional unit at approximately (\u201316.5, \u201348.5)) to assist in transferring mined resources.  \n\u2022 A wooden chest placed at (\u201313.5, \u201351.5) that acts as temporary storage.\n\n### Smelting Process Cluster\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Stone furnaces located at (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) used to convert raw ores into plates.  \n\u2022 Associated burner inserters and wooden chests configured to support the smelting workflow.\n\n### Fluid and Electrical Infrastructure\nConsists of:\n\u2022 An offshore pump at (0.5, 30.5) delivering water to the network.  \n\u2022 Multiple pipe groups that form an extensive fluid distribution network (with fluid system IDs evolving over recent steps).  \n\u2022 Electricity groups interlinking dispersed power poles and belt groups that connect various production and processing sectors.\n\n### Research Lab Network\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Lab units configured for automation research and processing science packs.  \n\u2022 Laboratory components (each with a unique electrical identifier that has been updated in recent steps, e.g. 14229 and 14255) that continue to experience power connectivity issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue:\n  \u2013 The extra steam engine remains unplaceable due to severe spatial congestion in the boiler zone around (8.0, 20.5), compounded by overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts near the (8.5, 22.5) connection point.\n  \u2013 To mitigate, manually remove or reposition interfering entities, redesign the adjacent connection interfaces to enlarge the buildable area, or relocate the extra steam engine to a less congested area.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Network Connection Warnings:\n  \u2013 Multiple steam engines report disconnection from the power network and deficiencies in fluid input.\n  \u2013 Verify proper alignment of connection points between the boiler\u2019s steam output and each engine, and ensure that both electrical and fluid piping are correctly integrated to avoid missing inputs.\n\n\u2022 Research Lab Power Connectivity Issue:\n  \u2013 Lab units continue to show a NO_POWER status despite repeated diagnostics.\n  \u2013 Reassess and reconfigure the electrical network layout so that lab components are effectively integrated into the primary power grid, with well\u2013aligned power poles and accurate electrical group identifiers."}
