{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various components with fluid system 34460\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Small Electric Poles around the area for electricity distribution\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with output blocked\n\n### Storage and Research\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n- Lab with automation science packs but no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having it in inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Check that the output of mining drills or other entities is not blocked by items on the ground or lack of a destination entity to accept the output.\n\n### Errors related to power connectivity\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are properly connected to the power network to avoid issues such as inserters not receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and other processing entities have the necessary ingredients to operate, as seen with furnaces having no ingredients to smelt."}
