{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x)\nConsists of steam engine (position x), boiler (position y) and offshore pump (position z)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position (y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position (y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position (y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position (y1)\n- Assembling machine at position (z1) and inserter at position (a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position (z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target location is clear of any blocking entities before attempting to place an electric pole. The current logs indicate that there are entities blocking the connection points at (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0).\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Ensure that the steam engine is nearby and accessible when attempting to insert coal. The logs indicate that the agent could not find a nearby entity that can accept coal.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
