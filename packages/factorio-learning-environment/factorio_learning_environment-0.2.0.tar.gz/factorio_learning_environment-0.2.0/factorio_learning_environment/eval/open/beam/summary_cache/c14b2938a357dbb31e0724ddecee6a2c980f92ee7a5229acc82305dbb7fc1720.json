{"content": "The operations to transfer coal and iron ore have been executed, but there are still issues with both furnaces:\n\n1. The first furnace is showing \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" and has 9 coal remaining, indicating that it has no iron ore to smelt.\n2. The second furnace has 5 iron ore but is \"NO_FUEL,\" meaning it lacks coal to operate.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Refuel the Second Furnace**: I need to transfer some coal from the first furnace to the second furnace to enable it to start smelting the iron ore.\n2. **Check the First Furnace**: After transferring coal, I will check if the first furnace can be fed with iron ore to keep it operational.\n\n### Let's proceed with these actions:\n\n#### Step 12: Transfer coal from the first furnace to the second furnace\n# Transfer some coal to the second furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, second_furnace, quantity=min(5, existing_furnace_coal))\n\n# Check the final inventory and furnace states after these operations\nprint(f'Updated Inventory after transferring coal to the second furnace: {inspect_inventory()}')\nprint(f'Entities on the map after updates: {get_entities()}')  # Check the state of the furnaces again after updates.", "summary_range": "[1-28]"}
