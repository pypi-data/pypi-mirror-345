{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a transport belt network.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-10.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -49.5), and (-5.5, -49.5) for moving items between entities.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storage.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the mining drill to the furnace and other entities, facilitating the transportation of materials.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- A series of transport belts connecting various entities, including the mining drill, furnace, and inserters. Specific belt positions include:\n  - Belt from position (-15.5, -54.5) to (-13.5, -54.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt from position (-21.5, -51.5) to (-19.5, -51.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt from position (-17.5, -50.5) to (-17.5, -52.5), direction UP.\n  - Additional belts at positions (-9.5, -53.5) to (-9.5, -55.5), direction UP, and (-15.5, -51.5) to (-15.5, -53.5), direction UP.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts Directly to Non-Belt Entities\n- Ensure to use an inserter when attempting to connect a transport belt to a stone furnace or wooden chest. Direct connections are not possible.\n\n### NameError: Undefined Variables\n- Verify that all variables, such as `drill_to_belt_inserter`, are properly defined before use. Consider checking for typographical errors or ensuring that the variable is initialized.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure sufficient inventory of items like coal before attempting to insert them into entities. Regularly check inventory levels to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors when Inspecting Inventory of Transport Belts\n- Confirm that the transport belt entity is correctly referenced and that its inventory is accessible before attempting to inspect it. Ensure the entity is not nil and properly initialized."}
