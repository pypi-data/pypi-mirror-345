{"content": "\"\"\"\nAfter extracting the remaining Copper Ore from the active furnace, here\u2019s the updated status:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now contains only **18 Iron Plates**, having successfully removed all Copper Ore. It remains in a **\"WORKING\"** status.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **5 pieces of copper ore** now available in the inventory (after extraction).\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is operational but does not have any Copper Ore currently for processing, which means it cannot produce Copper Plates.\n- The total Copper Ore stands at **5 pieces**, which is sufficient to initiate processing.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Copper Ore into the Furnace**: Insert **3 pieces of Copper Ore** into the furnace to initiate the smelting process.\n2. **Monitor the Operation**: After loading, ensure the furnace transitions from **\"WORKING\"** to actively smelting Copper Plates.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to load **3 pieces of Copper Ore** back into the active furnace for smelting. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the Copper Ore into the active furnace for smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Insert 3 pieces of Copper Ore into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_loading = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-loading\noverall_inventory_after_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after loading.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading Copper Ore: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_loading}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading copper: {overall_inventory_after_loading}\")  # Total inventory after operations. \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-306]"}
