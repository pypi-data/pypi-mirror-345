{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position x=0.0, y=0.0) with fuel inventory full of coal and producing iron plates. The furnace has warnings about no ingredients to smelt and its fuel source being full.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=9783) with pipes connecting positions (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5). The status of the pipe network is empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (x=-7.5, y=17.5), (x=-6.5, y=16.5), (x=-8.5, y=16.5), ..., (x=0.5, y=18.5), (x=1.5, y=18.5), (x=-8.5, y=20.5). The network has a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Moving to New Area\n- Ensure that when moving to a new area, the indices used are integers. Avoid using string indices for movement operations.\n\n### Errors in Offshore Pump Placement\n- Verify the suitability of the position before attempting to place an offshore pump. Ensure the selected location is adjacent to a water source and is free from obstructions.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Placement Issues\n- Confirm that the intended placement area for boilers and steam engines is suitable and free from obstructions. Consider adjusting the position if placement fails.\n\n### Connection Failures between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and boiler. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes.\n\n### Electric Pole Connection Issues\n- When connecting electric poles, ensure that the placement is correct and that there are no obstructions preventing the connection.\n\n### Boiler Placement Error\n- Avoid using non-numeric types when specifying positions for boiler placement. Ensure that the position values are numeric and valid."}
