{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Offshore Pump at position(x=106.5, y=-32.5)\nConsists of offshore pump at position(x=106.5, y=-32.5), connected to pipes at positions (x=107.5 y=-34.5), (x=105.5 y=-32.5), (x=105.5 y=-31.5), and (x=106.5 y=-31.5).\n\n### Boiler at position(x=111.5, y=-32.0)\nConsists of boiler at position(x=111.5, y=-32.0), connected to pipes at positions (x=109.5 y=-33.5), (x=110.5 y=-33.5), (x=111.5 y=-33.5), (x=112.5 y=-33.5), and (x=113.5 y=-33.5).\n\n### Electricity Generator at position(x=117.5, y=-30.5)\nConsists of steam engine at position(x=117.5, y=-30.5), connected to small electric poles at positions (x=115.5 y=-32.5), (x=115.5 y=-30.5), and pipes at positions (x=115.5 y=-33.5), (x=116.5 y=-33.5), and (x=117.5 y=-33.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0), connected to a stone furnace at position(x=41.0, y=-80.0), and transport belts at positions (x=39.5 y=-83.5) and (x=40.5 y=-79.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n*   **Incorrect use of connect_entities() function**: The connect_entities() function takes 3 positional arguments, but 5 were given. Ensure that the correct number of arguments is passed to the function.\n*   **'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer**: When calling the connect_entities() function, ensure that integer values are passed instead of float values.\n*   **'Position' object has no attribute 'position'**: When accessing the position of an entity, use the 'x' and 'y' attributes directly instead of trying to access a 'position' attribute.\n*   **Out of fuel warnings**: Ensure that the boiler and burner mining drill have a sufficient fuel supply to operate.\n*   **No fluid present in connections warnings**: Ensure that the offshore pumps and pipes are properly connected to a fluid source.\n*   **No ingredients to smelt warnings**: Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt.\n*   **Output blocked by item on the ground warnings**: Ensure that the transport belts and inserter are properly configured to handle the output of the burner mining drill.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   **connect_entities() function**: This function is used to connect entities, but its usage has been incorrect in some cases. Ensure that the correct number and type of arguments are passed to the function.\n*   **Entity positions and connections**: The positions and connections of entities such as offshore pumps, boilers, and pipes are crucial for proper functionality. Ensure that these entities are properly connected and positioned.\n*   **Important variables**:\n    *   `offshore_pump`: The offshore pump entity.\n    *   `boiler`: The boiler entity.\n    *   `burner_mining_drill`: The burner mining drill entity.\n    *   `stone_furnace`: The stone furnace entity.\n    *   `transport_belt`: The transport belt entity.\n    *   `inserter`: The inserter entity.\n    *   `pipe`: The pipe entity.\n    *   `small_electric_pole`: The small electric pole entity.\n    *   `steam_engine`: The steam engine entity."}
