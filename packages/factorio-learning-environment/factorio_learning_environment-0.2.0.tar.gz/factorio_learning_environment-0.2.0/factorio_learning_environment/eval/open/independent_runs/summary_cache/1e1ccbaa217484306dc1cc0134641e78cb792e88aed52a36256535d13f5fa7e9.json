{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items between entities.\n- **Wooden Chest** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing resources.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) moving items to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Output Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates to the output chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) serving as the output chest for iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that furnaces have enough space to receive additional items. Regularly extract produced items to prevent inventory overflow.\n\n### Inserter Operation Errors\n- Verify that inserters have a clear path to transfer items. Ensure destination inventories have space to receive items to avoid blockage.\n\n### Resource Allocation Errors\n- Regularly monitor and refuel entities like mining drills and furnaces to maintain continuous operation and prevent downtime due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Output Management Errors\n- Regularly check the output chest to ensure it is not empty, and transfer items promptly to maintain production flow."}
