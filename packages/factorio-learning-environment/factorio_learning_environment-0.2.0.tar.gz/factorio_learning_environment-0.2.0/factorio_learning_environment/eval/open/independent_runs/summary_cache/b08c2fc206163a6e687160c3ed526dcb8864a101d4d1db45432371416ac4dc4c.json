{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-21, -74)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-21.0, y=-73.0) mining copper ore\n- Iron chest (x=-21.5, y=-74.5) storing copper ore\n- Burner inserter (x=-20.5, y=-74.5) moving ore to furnace\n- Stone furnace (x=-19.0, y=-74.0) smelting copper plates\n\n###Iron Mining and Smelting Setup at (-2, -76)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-2.0, y=-76.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace (x=-1.0, y=-74.0)\n- Burner inserter (x=0.5, y=-74.5)\n- Iron chest (x=1.5, y=-74.5) storing iron plates\n- Iron chest (x=0.5, y=-72.5) storing iron plates\n\n###Iron Plate Processing Setup at (3, -73)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (x=3.0, y=-73.0)\n- Stone furnace (x=5.0, y=-73.0)\n- Burner inserter (x=2.5, y=-74.5) moving items from chest\n- Burner inserter (x=6.5, y=-72.5)\n- Iron chest (x=7.5, y=-72.5) storing iron plates\n- Iron chest (x=3.5, y=-71.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Inserter Configuration\n- Ensure inserters are properly aligned with their pickup and drop positions\n- The inserter at (x=2.5, y=-74.5) has no valid destination entity to drop items into, causing blocked output\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Mining drills are running out of fuel, ensure consistent fuel supply\n- Some furnaces have no ingredients to smelt despite having fuel, check input logistics\n\n### Space Management\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - ensure proper input logistics are set up\n- Some furnaces show \"furnace result is full\" - ensure output is being cleared regularly\n\n### Entity Placement\n- Ensure entities are placed with proper spacing and alignment to allow inserters to function correctly\n- Check that inserters have valid pickup and drop locations before placement"}
