{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5).\n\n### Lab at position(2.5, -18.5)\nConsists of a lab (position 2.5, -18.5) connected to the nearest electric pole.\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0).\n\n### Furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 5.0, 5.0).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump and boiler\n- Ensure that the positions of the offshore pump and boiler are correctly aligned for pipe connections. The coordinates must allow for a valid connection.\n\n### Errors when using electric poles\n- Verify that electric poles are within range of the entities they are intended to power. Check the distance and ensure that the power network is properly established.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the intended position.\n\n### Errors related to fluid connections\n- Confirm that the entities have the necessary input fluids and are properly connected to the fluid network. Check for any obstructions or misalignments in the piping system."}
