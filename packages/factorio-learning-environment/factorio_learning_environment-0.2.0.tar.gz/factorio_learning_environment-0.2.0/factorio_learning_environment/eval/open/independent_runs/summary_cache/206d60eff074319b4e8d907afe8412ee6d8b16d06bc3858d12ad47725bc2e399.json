{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the current steps. The agent attempted to place various entities such as furnaces, wooden chests, and transport belts, but all attempts have failed due to placement errors or restrictions.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in non-buildable areas\n- Ensure that the area is clear and buildable before attempting to place an entity. Verify the buildability of the area using the game's API or visual indicators.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check if the target tile is already occupied by another entity or is restricted for building. Use the map's feedback or API to confirm the availability of the tile for placement.\n\n### Errors when supplying resources to non-existent or unplaced entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to supply resources to is correctly placed and exists on the map. Ensure that the entity is within reach and capable of accepting the resources.\n\n### Errors due to global build restrictions\n- Be aware of any global restrictions that might prevent entity placement. Check for any game rules or conditions that might limit where certain entities can be placed.\n\n### Errors when using entities but being too far\n- Move closer to the target entity before attempting to interact with it. Ensure you are within the operational range to perform actions like inserting items or extracting resources."}
