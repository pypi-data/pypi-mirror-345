{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created in the current steps. The agent attempted to place wooden chests at various positions, but none of these attempts resulted in successful placement due to errors or obstructions.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inspecting non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to inspect actually exists at the specified position before attempting to inspect it. This will prevent errors related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Before attempting to place an entity, verify that the target tile is free of obstructions. This can be done by checking for nearby entities and ensuring the space is clear.\n\n### Errors due to repeated placement attempts without success\n- If placement of an entity fails, analyze the cause of failure before retrying. Repeatedly attempting to place an entity without addressing the underlying issue will not result in success. Consider checking for obstructions or incorrect positioning."}
