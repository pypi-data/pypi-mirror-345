{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with a full output warning, indicating it is producing iron plates but cannot output them due to storage constraints.\n- Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with a full output warning.\n- Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with a full output warning.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Processing at Position (-5.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Multiple wooden chests in the vicinity, some of which are full of iron plates, indicating a storage bottleneck.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore and dropping it into a wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5), which is full.\n- Several wooden chests nearby, indicating potential storage for mined resources.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Related to Full Output and Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests have enough capacity to accommodate the output from furnaces and mining drills. Consider adding more chests or upgrading to larger storage solutions to prevent output blockage.\n\n### Errors with Full Furnaces\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from halting production due to full output inventories. Automating the transfer of items from furnaces to storage can help mitigate this issue.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- The mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) is unable to continue mining because the chest at its drop position is full. Ensure that the chest is regularly emptied or connected to a larger storage system to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_count: int` - Represents the total count of iron ore in storage.\n  - `iron_plate_count: int` - Represents the total count of iron plates in storage.\n  - `coal_count: int` - Represents the total count of coal available for fueling furnaces and drills."}
