{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Lab at position(-23.5, 29.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric pole at position(-22.5, 27.5)\n\n### Electricity generator at position(x)\nConsists of steam engine(position x), boiler(position y) and offshore pump (position z)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all structures requiring power, such as labs, are connected to a power source. Check the status of electric poles and ensure they are functioning correctly.\n- If an entity shows a status of NO_POWER, verify the connections and power supply to that entity.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
