{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Steam engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler with water\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine with steam\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with copper ore input and copper plate output\n\n### Lab at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Type Errors with Boiler Dimensions\n- Ensure that the attributes used for calculations are of compatible types. Convert `ModelPrivateAttr` to a string or real number before performing arithmetic operations.\n\n### Attribute Errors with Prototype Access\n- Verify that the attributes being accessed on prototypes exist. For example, ensure `tile_dimensions` is a valid attribute for the prototype being used.\n\n### Connection Failures Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Before attempting to connect entities, ensure you have the required items in your inventory, such as pipes or small electric poles.\n\n### Crafting and Refueling Errors\n- Maintain sufficient materials in your inventory for crafting essential items like small electric poles and ensure the boiler is adequately refueled with coal.\n\n### Lab Connection and Status Errors\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source and that the required input materials are available for it to function.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnace\n- Confirm that the furnace contains the expected items before attempting to extract them to avoid extraction errors."}
