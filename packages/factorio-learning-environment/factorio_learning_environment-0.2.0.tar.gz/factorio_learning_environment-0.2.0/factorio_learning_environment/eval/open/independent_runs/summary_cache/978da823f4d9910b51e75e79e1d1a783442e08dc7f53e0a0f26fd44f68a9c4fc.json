{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-2.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position(-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at position(4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected by pipe networks for water and steam\n- Electric poles connecting power to the grid\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at position(0.0, 0.0)\nMultiple furnaces for iron plate production:\n- Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position(2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and iron plate output\n- Furnace at position(4.0, 4.0) with coal fuel\n- Furnace at position(6.0, 4.0)\n\n### Inserter Production Line at position(23.5, 2.5)\n- Assembling machine at position(23.5, 2.5)\n- Two burner inserters at positions(21.5, 2.5) and (25.5, 2.5)\n- Input wooden chest at position(20.5, 2.5) containing 29 inserters\n- Output wooden chest at position(26.5, 2.5)\n\n### Science Pack Production at position(32.5, 5.5)\n- Assembling machine for logistics science packs at position(32.5, 5.5)\n- Connected to electrical network via small electric pole at position(30.5, 7.5)\n\n### Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs positioned across the map:\n- Labs at positions(10.5, 0.5), (18.5, 3.5), (11.5, 6.5), (23.5, 13.5)\n- Currently researching automation technology\n- Some labs contain logistics science packs and automation science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors\n- When connecting entities with pipes, ensure the connection points are valid and entities are properly aligned\n- Failed connections between boiler and steam engine indicate possible misalignment or incorrect positioning\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in inventory before attempting to insert into boilers\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before crafting (particularly for electronic circuits)\n\n### Research Prerequisites\n- Check technology prerequisites before setting research:\n  - Electronics requires Automation research completion\n  - Fast-inserter requires Electronics research completion\n- Cannot research already completed technologies (e.g., Logistics)\n\n### Item Naming\n- Use correct item prototype names:\n  - Use LogisticsSciencePack instead of LogisticSciencePack\n  - Use AutomationSciencePack for automation science packs\n\n### Production Line Issues\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before starting assembly processes\n- Monitor furnace fuel levels and input materials to maintain continuous production"}
