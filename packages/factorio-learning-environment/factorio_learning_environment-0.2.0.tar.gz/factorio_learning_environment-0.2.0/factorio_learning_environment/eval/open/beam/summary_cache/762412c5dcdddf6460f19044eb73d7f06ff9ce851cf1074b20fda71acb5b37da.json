{"content": "Thank you for the error feedback. Let's analyze what we've learned:\n\nANALYSIS REPORT\n\n1. Attempted Actions:\n- Tried to move to furnace location (21.0, -17.0) - Successful\n- Attempted to inspect furnace contents - Successful but returned empty {}\n- Tried to insert coal into furnace - Failed due to \"Inventory is full\" error\n\n2. Key Issues Identified:\n- The furnace appears to be in an inconsistent state where it:\n  * Shows as full (can't insert items)\n  * But reports empty contents\n  * This suggests a possible desync between the actual and reported state\n\n3. Successful Patterns:\n- Movement commands work reliably\n- Inventory inspection commands work (even if showing unexpected results)\n- Error handling provides clear feedback about insertion failures\n\n4. Recommendations for Future Interactions:\n\n```python\n# Pattern 1: Always check entity state before operations\ndef check_furnace_state(furnace):\n    print(f\"Position: {furnace.position}\")\n    print(f\"Contents: {inspect_inventory(furnace)}\")\n    print(f\"Status: {furnace.status}\")\n\n# Pattern 2: Clear entity before reuse\ndef reset_furnace(furnace):\n    # Try to extract all possible item types\n    for item in [Prototype.IronPlate, Prototype.Coal, Prototype.IronOre]:\n        try:\n            extract_item(item, furnace.position, 50)  # Use large number to ensure complete extraction\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"No {item} to extract\")\n\n# Pattern 3: Staged operations with verification\ndef setup_furnace(furnace):\n    # 1. Clear first\n    reset_furnace(furnace)\n    # 2. Verify empty\n    check_furnace_state(furnace)\n    # 3. Insert new materials\n    try:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=1)  # Start with small amounts\n        insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=1)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Insert failed: {e}\")\n```\n\n5. Tips for Future Implementation:\n- Always check entity state before operations\n- Use smaller quantities when testing insertions\n- Implement clear/reset operations before reuse\n- Add verification steps between operations\n- Handle each item type separately\n- Use try/except blocks for potentially failing operations\n\n6. Next Steps to Try:\n- Attempt to destroy and rebuild the furnace if it's in an inconsistent state\n- Try extracting items one at a time instead of bulk operations\n- Implement a monitoring system to track furnace state changes\n- Add delays between operations to allow for state updates\n\n7. Error Patterns to Watch:\n- \"Inventory full\" errors despite empty reported contents\n- Mismatches between visual state and reported state\n- Failed insertions when space should be available\n\nThis analysis suggests we need a more robust approach to handling entity states and should implement better verification steps between operations.", "summary_range": "[1-3554]"}
