{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS and warnings for no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS and warnings for no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, -0.5) with a status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, connected to the stone furnace at (1.0, 1.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, -0.5) with a status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, connected to the stone furnace at (3.0, 1.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-0.5, 1.5) with a status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, connected to the stone furnace at (1.0, 1.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 2.5) with a status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, connected to the stone furnaces at (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 2.5) with a status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, connected to the stone furnace at (3.0, 1.0).\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), outputs from (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), outputs from (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities. For example, ensure you have iron ore before trying to insert it into a furnace, and coal before inserting it into an inserter.\n\n### Errors When Refueling Inserters\n- Make sure that inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Check your inventory for coal or other fuel sources before attempting to refuel inserters.\n\n### Assertion Errors with Furnace Status\n- Verify that furnaces are correctly set up and have the necessary ingredients and fuel to operate. Ensure that the furnace is not blocked and has a clear path for input and output."}
