This includes checking for existing entities or items on the ground.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity available to accept the output from production entities like mining drills. This may involve placing chests or conveyors to transport items away.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of inserters and chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
