Check the belt's status and inventory before issuing extraction commands.\n\n#### Errors with full chests and furnaces\n- **Issue**: Several chests and furnaces are full, causing inserters to stop functioning and furnaces to halt production.\n- **Solution**: Regularly check the inventory of chests and furnaces. Expand storage capacity or route excess items to other storage or production facilities.\n\n#### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- **Issue**: Inserters are waiting for source items because the belts they are connected to are empty or blocked.\n- **Solution**: Ensure belts are properly connected and have a steady supply of items. Clear any blockages and verify the flow of materials.\n\n#### Errors with mining drills waiting for space\n- **Issue**: Mining drills are waiting for space because the transport belts at their drop positions are blocked.\n- **Solution**: Clear the transport belts at the drop positions to allow the mining drills to continue operation. Ensure belts are not overloaded or blocked downstream.\n\n#### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients\n- **Issue**: Furnaces are idle because they lack ingredients to smelt.\n- **Solution**: Ensure a steady supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore) is delivered to the furnaces. Check the belts and inserters feeding the furnaces for issues."}
