{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Fuel: 8 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n    - Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing 8 units of iron ore\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Multiple wooden chests positioned between (5.5, -60.5) and (9.5, -60.5) with empty inventories.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -50.5) with empty inventory.\n  - Wooden chests at positions (-11.5, -50.5) to (-8.5, -50.5) containing 1600 iron plates each, with warnings indicating they are full.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-7.5, -50.5) containing 315 iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing 790 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with 1 unit of coal, no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with 4 units of coal, producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with 19 units of coal, no ingredients to smelt.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Incorrect Use of Function Arguments\n- **Error**: `TypeError: ExtractItem.__call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'position'`\n  - **Tip**: Ensure that the function `extract_item` is called with the correct arguments as defined in its signature. Remove the 'position' keyword if it is not supported.\n\n### Full Storage Warnings\n- **Warning**: Several chests are full, preventing further storage of items.\n  - **Tip**: Regularly check and empty full chests to ensure continuous operation of mining and production facilities.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- **Warning**: Furnaces are running without ingredients to smelt.\n  - **Tip**: Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials to maintain efficient production.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - `extract_item`: Encountered a `TypeError` due to incorrect argument usage. Ensure correct argument names and types when invoking this function.\n- **Variables**:\n  - `extracted_iron_ore`: Intended to store iron ore extracted from a chest, but operation failed due to argument error."}
