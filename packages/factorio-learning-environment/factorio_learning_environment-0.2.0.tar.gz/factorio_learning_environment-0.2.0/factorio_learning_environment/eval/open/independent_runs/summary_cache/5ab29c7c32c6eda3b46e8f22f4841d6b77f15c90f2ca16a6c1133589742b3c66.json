{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities, notably at positions (-47.5, -122.5) and (-46.5, -122.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Lab with no power\n- Multiple PipeGroups and ElectricityGroup indicating infrastructure for fluid and power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected to the intended entities. Verify that there are no obstructions or misalignments in the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is required for crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Power\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to reconnect power. Verify that all entities are within the power network's range.\n\n### NameError in Code\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly defined in the code. Double-check for typos or undefined variables.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a power source and that the power network is operational. Check for any disconnected poles or insufficient power supply."}
