{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a transport belt and a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5).\n- Transport Belt segment from position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) to (x=38.5, y=-83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal and processing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belt segment from position (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5) connecting to another burner inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items and transferring to the transport belt.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal and processing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) storing copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) transferring items to another wooden chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) storing additional copper plates.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5) and from (x=4.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the item you wish to extract. For example, attempting to extract iron plates from a position where there are none will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. If the tile is occupied, clear it first to avoid placement errors."}
