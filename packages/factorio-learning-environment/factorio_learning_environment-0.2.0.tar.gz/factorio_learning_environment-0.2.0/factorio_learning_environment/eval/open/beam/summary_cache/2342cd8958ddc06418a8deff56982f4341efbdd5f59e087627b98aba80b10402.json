{"content": "Ah, I see the issue now. We need to craft the burner mining drill first! Let's analyze what we have and what we need:\n\n1. Current inventory shows:\n- 131 iron plates\n- 1 stone furnace\n- 90 coal\n- 80 stone\n\n2. Burner mining drill recipe requires:\n- 3 iron plates\n- 3 iron gear wheels\n- 1 stone furnace\n\nLet's craft what we need:\n\n```python\n# First craft iron gear wheels\nprint(f\"Starting inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Craft iron gear wheels (need 3 for the drill)\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=3)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting gears: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Now craft the burner mining drill\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting drill: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Find iron ore and place drill\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# Place and fuel the drill\ndrill = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, position=iron_pos)\nif drill:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=10)\n    print(f\"Placed and fueled mining drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n    # Place furnace next to drill's output\n    furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n        Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n        reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n        spacing=1\n    )\n    if furnace:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=10)\n        print(f\"Placed and fueled furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Craft the required iron gear wheels\n2. Craft the burner mining drill\n3. Place the drill and furnace in the correct positions\n4. Fuel both machines\n\nThe key insight was that we were trying to place a burner mining drill without crafting it first. Now we're crafting all components in the correct order.", "summary_range": "[1-224]"}
