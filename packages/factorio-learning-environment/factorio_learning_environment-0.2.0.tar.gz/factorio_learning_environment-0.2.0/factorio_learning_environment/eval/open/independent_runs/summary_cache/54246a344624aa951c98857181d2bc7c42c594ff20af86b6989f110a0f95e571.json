{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill at position(5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes and entities\n- Ensure that the pipes are placed correctly and not blocked by other entities before attempting to connect them. Check the surrounding area for any obstructions.\n- Verify that the offshore pump is positioned correctly to connect to the boiler and that there are no existing pipes that may interfere with the connection.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Make sure that all power-consuming entities (like the steam engine and lab) are connected to a power network. Check the status of connections and ensure there are no breaks in the power supply.\n- Confirm that the boiler has the necessary input liquid to function and is properly connected to the offshore pump. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may block placement."}
