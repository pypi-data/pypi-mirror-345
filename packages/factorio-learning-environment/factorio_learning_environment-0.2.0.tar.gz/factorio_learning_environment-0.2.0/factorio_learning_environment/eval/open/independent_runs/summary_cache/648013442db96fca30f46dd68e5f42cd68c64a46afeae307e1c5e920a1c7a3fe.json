{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the current state report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (0,0)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0,0) - smelting iron ore to plates\n- Stone furnace at (2,0) - smelting iron ore to plates\n\n### Copper Smelting Area at (4,4)  \nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (4,4) - smelting copper ore to plates\n- Stone furnace at (6,4) - smelting copper ore to plates\n\n### Power Generation System\nComponents:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) providing water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Connected pipe network carrying water and steam between components\n- Electricity distribution network connecting labs and other powered entities\n\n### Research Lab Complex\nMultiple labs positioned at:\n- Lab at (10.5, 0.5)\n- Lab at (18.5, 3.5)\n- Lab at (11.5, 6.5)\n- Lab at (4.5, 11.5)\n- Lab at (3.5, 17.5)\n- Lab at (10.5, 22.5)\nAll labs are connected to power grid and partially loaded with science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Research Technology Selection Errors\n- Cannot research already completed technologies (electronics, logistics, military) - Check technology prerequisites and research state before attempting research\n\n### Science Pack Production Errors\n- Unable to craft logistic science packs due to missing prerequisites in crafting chain:\n  - Need iron plates to craft iron gear wheels\n  - Need iron gear wheels to craft inserters\n  - Need inserters to craft logistic science packs\n- Ensure all prerequisite items are available before attempting complex crafting chains\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Labs occasionally lose power connection - Ensure consistent power pole coverage between power source and all labs\n\n### Resource Management\n- Running out of coal for boiler operation - Maintain adequate coal supplies for continuous power generation\n- Monitor and maintain minimum resource levels (coal, iron ore, copper ore) for continuous operation\n\n### Item Insertion Errors\n- Cannot insert items that are not in inventory - Verify item availability before attempting insertions into labs or other entities"}
