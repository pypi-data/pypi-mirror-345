{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), connected to a pipe-to-ground at position (x=16.5, y=17.5) and a pipe at position (x=17.5, y=17.5). It is working with an energy level of 15000.0 and is part of fluid system 1811.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), fueled with coal (24 units), connected to multiple pipes around positions (x=-0.5, y=21.5) to (x=3.5, y=23.5). It is working with an energy level of 2000.0 and is part of fluid system 1822.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), connected to pipes at positions (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=-8.5, y=23.5). It is working and part of fluid system 1822.\n- **Pipe Groups**:\n  - Steam pipe group for fluid system 1811, running from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n  - Water pipe group for fluid system 1822, running from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at positions such as (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=16.5, y=24.5), and others, maintaining voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n- No specific errors were logged in the provided steps. Ensure to monitor for any misplaced entities or incorrect connections in future steps.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions or important variables were defined or invoked in the provided steps.
