{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with output blocked status, waiting for space in destination.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at position (-15.5, -51.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Inserter at position (-13.5, -51.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Inserter at position (-15.5, -48.5), waiting for space in destination.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** around the furnace:\n  - Inserter at position (0.5, -1.5), waiting for space in destination.\n  - Inserter at position (-1.5, 0.5), waiting for space in destination.\n  - Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5), waiting for space in destination.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Chest at position (-15.5, -53.5), normal status.\n  - Chest at position (-17.5, -51.5), normal status.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Path Connection\n- Ensure that the path for belts is clear of obstructions before attempting to connect belts. Verify that there is a valid path to normalize between entities.\n- When placing belts manually, confirm that the target location is not occupied by another object.\n\n### Inserter Blockages\n- Regularly clear the drop and source positions of inserters to prevent blockages.\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity available to accept items from inserters to avoid output blockages.\n\n### Source Item Shortages\n- Verify that there are nearby entities capable of accepting items when attempting to insert source items into the supply chain.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'transport-belt', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n- `entity_status`: Dict[Position, EntityStatus] - Monitors the status of entities on the map, such as NORMAL, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, and WORKING."}
