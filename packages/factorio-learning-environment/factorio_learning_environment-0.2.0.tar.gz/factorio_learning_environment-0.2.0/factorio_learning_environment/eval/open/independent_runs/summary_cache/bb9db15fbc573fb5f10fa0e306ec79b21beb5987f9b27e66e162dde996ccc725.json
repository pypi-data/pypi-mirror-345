{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: 3 units of coal\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is free of other entities or obstructions before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing structures or items on the ground that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Verify that the destination location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity. This can prevent errors related to moving entities like Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors when using extractors with blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or storage available to accept the output from extractors like Burner Mining Drills. This will prevent warnings and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it using the API. This will avoid exceptions related to missing entities.\n\n### Errors when placing Transport Belts and Inserters\n- Check that the desired location for placing Transport Belts and Inserters is valid and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features."}
