{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), refueled and operational.\n- Wooden Chests for coal storage at positions:\n  - (x=40.5, y=-83.5) with inventory: {'coal': 698}\n  - (x=41.5, y=-83.5) with inventory: {'coal': 750, 'iron-plate': 82}\n  - (x=42.5, y=-83.5) with inventory: {'coal': 681}\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chests.\n\n### Iron and Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=10.0, y=0.0), currently with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserters at positions:\n  - (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=3.5, y=0.5), waiting for source items.\n  - (x=6.5, y=0.5), (x=8.5, y=0.5), and (x=11.5, y=0.5), waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chests at positions:\n  - (x=7.5, y=0.5) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 361, 'copper-plate': 450}\n  - (x=12.5, y=0.5) with inventory: {'copper-plate': 1044}\n- BeltGroup connecting various parts of the facility.\n\n### Additional Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions:\n  - (x=20.5, y=0.5) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 1000}\n  - (x=22.5, y=0.5) with inventory: {'copper-plate': 1000}\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting and Inventory Management\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting wooden chests failed due to insufficient wood.\n- Regularly check inventory space to avoid full inventory errors when harvesting or transferring items.\n\n### Errors in Placing and Using Chests\n- Verify that the required chests are available in the inventory before attempting to place them on the map.\n- Ensure that the target position for placing chests is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Chests\n- Move closer to the target chest before attempting to extract items to ensure successful extraction.\n- Clear any blockages in inserters to maintain the flow of items between entities.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operations\n- Monitor inserters for blockages and ensure they have access to source items to prevent them from stalling.\n- Address warnings and status issues in inserters to maintain efficiency in item transfer operations."}
