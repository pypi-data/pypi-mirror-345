This will prevent failed connections due to missing items.\n\n### Errors when Fixing Fluid Connections\n- Check for placement blockages before attempting to connect pipes. Ensure that the path is clear and there are no obstructions that could prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Make sure all entities that require power are connected to an active power network. Verify that the power source is operational and connected to the entities needing electricity."}
