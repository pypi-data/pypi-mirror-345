{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is unoccupied and valid before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to desired locations\n- Verify that the destination location for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Confirm the existence of entities at the specified positions before attempting to retrieve them to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- When connecting belts, ensure that the start and end points are compatible and that the path is clear for belt placement.\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to a Stone Furnace; use an inserter to input items into the furnace.\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or a clear path for the output of entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors with missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for entities like Stone Furnaces to function properly and avoid status warnings of \"No Ingredients.\""}
