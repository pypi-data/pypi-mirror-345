{"content": "I see the core issue now - we need to move closer to our production setup before we can place additional entities. Let's fix this:\n\n```python\n# First move closer to our existing setup\ntarget_pos = Position(x=19, y=-17)  # Position of our mining drill\nmove_to(Position(x=15, y=-12))  # Moving within 10 tiles of our setup\nprint(\"Moved closer to production setup\")\n\n# Now check positions of existing entities\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\nprint(f\"Mining drill at: {drill.position}, drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Place transport belt from drill's drop position\nbelt = place_entity(\n    Prototype.TransportBelt,\n    position=drill.drop_position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed transport belt at: {belt.position}\")\n\n# Check status of our automated setup\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Transport belt status: {belt.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {furnace.status}\")\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Move us within range of our existing setup\n2. Allow us to place the transport belt\n3. Complete the automation chain\n\nLet me know if you need any adjustments to these coordinates or if you'd like to try a different approach!", "summary_range": "[1-2560]"}
