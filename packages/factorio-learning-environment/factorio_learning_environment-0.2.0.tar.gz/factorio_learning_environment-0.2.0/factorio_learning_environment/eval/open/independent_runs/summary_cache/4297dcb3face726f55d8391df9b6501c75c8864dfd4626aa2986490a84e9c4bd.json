{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5), currently fueled with coal and operational, but blocked by items on the ground.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0), fueled with coal, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target location is clear before attempting to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, Transport Belts, and Burner Inserters.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. For example, ensure a Stone Furnace exists at the intended position before calling `get_entity`.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Ensure the required items are present in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like drills.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept outputs from entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for entities like Stone Furnaces to function properly and avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning."}
