Check for any blockages or disconnections in the pipe network.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Steam\n- Verify that the boiler is producing steam and that the pipes are correctly connected from the boiler to the steam engine. Ensure there are no placement blockages preventing connections.\n\n### Failed Pipe Connections\n- When connecting pipes, ensure there are no obstacles or incorrect placements that block the connection. Re-evaluate the layout to allow for proper connectivity.\n\n### Inserter and Lab Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the power network connections to ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a functioning power source. Ensure the steam engine is operational to supply power.\n\n### Furnaces with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply lines or inserters feeding the furnaces to ensure they are operational and correctly positioned."}
