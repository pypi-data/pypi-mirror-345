{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Furnace** at position (-20.0, -70.0) and another at position (-18.0, -70.0) for smelting iron plates.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected via transport belts to a **Wooden Chest** at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of **Transport Belts** leading to a **Wooden Chest** at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -54.5) and a **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore to another **Wooden Chest** at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with a **Burner Inserter** at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates to a **Wooden Chest** at position (1.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple **Belt Groups** connecting various entities, including:\n  - BeltGroup from (x=-25.5 y=-70.5) to (x=-23.5 y=-70.5).\n  - BeltGroup from (x=-21.5 y=-67.5) to (x=-21.5 y=-69.5).\n  - BeltGroup from (x=-24.5 y=-64.5) to (x=-22.5 y=-66.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure continuous placement of belts without gaps to connect transport belts effectively. Gaps were detected at positions (-20.5, -65.5) and (-21.5, -65.5).\n- Verify the alignment and adjacency of belts before attempting to connect them to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This error was observed with inserters at positions (-20.5, -66.5) and (2.5, 0.5).\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. This issue was noted at positions (-20.0, -70.0), (-18.0, -70.0), and (0.0, 0.0).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to maintain continuous operation. The drill at position (53.0, -83.0) was out of fuel."}
