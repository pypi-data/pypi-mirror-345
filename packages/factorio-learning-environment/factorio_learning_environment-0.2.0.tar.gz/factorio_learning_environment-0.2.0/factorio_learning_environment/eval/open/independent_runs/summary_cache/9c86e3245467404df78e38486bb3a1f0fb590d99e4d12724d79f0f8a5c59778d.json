{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5) - currently working\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=4.0) - currently working with 17 coal remaining\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=7.5) - currently working\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole (x=1.5, y=7.5)\n\nThe system is now operational after coal was added to the boiler in steps 72 and 77. The power generation is working properly, providing electricity to the factory.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (x=18.5, y=73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=18.5, y=73.5) mining iron ore - currently working but limited by full chest\n- Wooden chest (x=18.5, y=75.5) collecting iron ore from the drill (currently contains 784 iron ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=19.0, y=77.0) with 22 coal, currently working with 4 iron ore\n- Inserter (x=19.5, y=78.5) to move iron plates from furnace to chest - now working\n- Wooden chest (x=19.5, y=79.5) for iron plate storage (currently contains 8 iron plates)\n- Chest output inserter (x=19.5, y=80.5) to extract plates from chest - waiting for space on belt\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=19.5, y=81.5) with belts extending to (x=14.5, y=78.5) - currently contains 32 iron plates\n- Additional belt system from (x=8.5, y=75.5) to (x=9.5, y=77.5) connecting to the circuit assembly\n- Small electric poles (x=21.5, y=73.5), (x=20.5, y=75.5), (x=21.5, y=78.5), (x=21.5, y=80.5)\n\nThe system is now fully working with power restored. The furnace is smelting iron ore into plates, and the electric components are operational. The output belt is getting full with iron plates.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (x=-48.5, y=78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=-48.5, y=78.5) mining copper ore - currently working but limited by full chest\n- Wooden chest (x=-48.5, y=80.5) collecting copper ore from the drill (currently contains 762 copper ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=-48.0, y=82.0) with 20 coal, currently working with 5 copper ore\n- Inserter (x=-47.5, y=83.5) to move copper plates from furnace to chest - now working\n- Wooden chest (x=-47.5, y=84.5) for copper plate storage (currently contains 8 copper plates)\n- Chest output inserter (x=-47.5, y=85.5) to extract plates from chest - waiting for space on belt\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=-47.5, y=86.5) extending to (x=-22.5, y=86.5) - currently contains 103 copper plates\n- Small electric poles (x=-45.5, y=78.5), (x=-46.5, y=80.5), (x=-45.5, y=83.5), (x=-45.5, y=85.5)\n\nThe system is now fully working with power restored. The furnace is smelting copper ore into plates, and the electric components are operational. The output belt is getting full with copper plates.\n\n### Circuit Production System\nConsists of:\n\n#### Copper Cable Assembly (x=-6.5, y=74.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (x=-6.5, y=74.5) set to produce copper cables - currently has ingredient shortage\n- Input inserter (x=-8.5, y=74.5) to feed copper plates - waiting for source items\n- Output inserter (x=-4.5, y=74.5) to move cables"}
