{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup (Partial)\n*   Consists of an Offshore Pump at `Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5)` connected via pipes `PipeGroup(fluid_system=6534, position=x=-8.5 y=-0.5)` to a Boiler at `Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5)`. The boiler was fueled in step 89.\n*   A Steam Engine is placed at `Position(x=0.5, y=6.5)`, but it is not yet connected to the boiler output via pipes (`PipeGroup(fluid_system=6537, position=x=-6.5 y=3.5)` exists but is empty and not connected to the engine). The steam engine has no fluid input and is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\n*   Consists of an Electric Mining Drill at `Position(x=17.5, y=1.5)` (currently without power).\n*   The drill drops coal into a Wooden Chest at `Position(x=17.5, y=3.5)`.\n*   A Burner Inserter at `Position(x=17.5, y=4.5)` moves coal from the first chest to a second Wooden Chest at `Position(x=17.5, y=5.5)`.\n"}
