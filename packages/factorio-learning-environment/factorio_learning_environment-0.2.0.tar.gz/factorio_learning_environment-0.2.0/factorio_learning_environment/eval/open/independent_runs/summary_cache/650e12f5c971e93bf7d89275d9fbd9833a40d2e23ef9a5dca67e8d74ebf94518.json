{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5) \n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0) \n- Offshore pump at position(-7.5, 25.5) \n- Small electric poles at positions:\n  - (-3.258, 2.177)\n  - (-4.5, 21.5)\n  - (-1.5, -11.5)\n  - (1.5, -10.5)\n  - (1.5, -11.5)\n  - (-2.5, -8.5)\n  - (-2.5, -9.5)\n  - (1.5, -9.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill at position(5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position(y1) to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting steam engine to electric pole\n- Ensure that the steam engine is within the range of the electric pole when attempting to connect. Check the connection status after placement.\n\n### Errors with boiler and offshore pump\n- Confirm that the boiler has a fuel source before attempting to connect it to the steam engine.\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is properly connected to pipes and that those pipes lead to the boiler for water supply.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
