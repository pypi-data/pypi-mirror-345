{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Collection at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for collecting iron ore.\n\n### Copper Ore Collection at Position (43.5, -79.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for collecting copper ore.\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting operations.\n- The Burner Mining Drill is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Copper Smelting at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) for smelting copper ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent errors related to occupied positions.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Always check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items before attempting to insert them into machines or other entities. This will prevent errors related to missing items.\n\n### Errors due to out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces to avoid interruptions in production due to lack of fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Used to place entities on the map. Ensure the target position is unoccupied to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_chest_position`: Position variable used for placing the copper chest.\n- `coal_drill`: Variable representing the coal mining drill, ensure it is properly fueled to maintain operation.\n- `iron_furnace`: Variable representing the iron furnace, ensure it has sufficient fuel and ingredients for smelting operations."}
