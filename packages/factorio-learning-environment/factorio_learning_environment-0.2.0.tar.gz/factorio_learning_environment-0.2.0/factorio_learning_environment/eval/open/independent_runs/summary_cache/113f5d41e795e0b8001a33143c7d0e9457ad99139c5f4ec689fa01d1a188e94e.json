{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions to facilitate fluid transport\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (15.0, 0.0) for smelting\n- Inserters at Positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) for item transfer\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors in Fluid Systems\n- Ensure all fluid entities such as offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines are properly connected with pipes to allow fluid flow. Check connections between offshore pumps and boilers.\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Connect steam engines to the power network to ensure they can generate and distribute electricity. Verify connections with electric poles.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source to function correctly. Check the proximity and connections to electric poles.\n\n### Repeated Replacement of Offshore Pump\n- Avoid unnecessary replacement of offshore pumps unless repositioning is required. Ensure the initial placement is correct.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connections\n- When connecting entities like pipes, ensure the correct positioning and alignment to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Persistent Disconnection of Power and Fluid Systems\n- Verify that all components of the power and fluid systems are correctly connected. Persistent warnings indicate a need to reassess the layout and connections of pipes and electric poles to ensure seamless operation.\n\n### Inserter Functionality Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are both powered and have access to source items. Check connections to electric poles and ensure that source items are available for inserters to function effectively."}
