{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe (position -10.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe (position -11.5, 23.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -11.5, 26.5)\n\n### Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n\n### Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n\n### Lab at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position x, status=EntityStatus.NO_POWER)\n\n### Stone furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Stone furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Electricity group at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at various positions including (x=-7.5, y=18.5), (x=-6.5, y=19.5), and others.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Various pipe groups at different positions with status EMPTY.\n\n### Electric network at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at various positions.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that there are no obstructing entities between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine when attempting to connect them. Clear any pipes or other structures that may block the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Check that all entities requiring power are connected to an electric network. If an entity is not connected, reposition electric poles or add new ones to establish a connection."}
