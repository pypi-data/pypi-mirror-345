{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing iron-ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) currently working and producing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position(42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0) currently out of fuel.\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) waiting for space in destination.\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) containing coal.\n\n### Coal Supply Chain\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) containing coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel shortages\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill and stone furnace are adequately fueled. Check the inventory of the wooden chest for coal and transfer it to the appropriate entities.\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Inserters may wait for source items or space in the destination. Make sure to have sufficient items in the source and ensure that the destination has space available.\n\n### Errors when extracting from chests\n- Always check the inventory of the wooden chest before extracting items to ensure there are enough items available.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it, especially when dealing with inserters and chests.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `extract_items(chest_position: Tuple[float, float], item: str, quantity: int) -> None`\n    - **Success Mode:** Successfully extracts items if available.\n    - **Failure Mode:** Fails if the chest does not contain enough items.\n  \n  - `insert_items(furnace_position: Tuple[float, float], item: str, quantity: int) -> None`\n    - **Success Mode:** Successfully inserts items into the furnace.\n    - **Failure Mode:** Fails if the furnace cannot accept more items due to inventory limits.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore: int` - Quantity of iron ore available.\n  - `coal: int` - Quantity of coal available in the wooden chest.\n  - `iron_plate: int` - Quantity of iron plates produced."}
