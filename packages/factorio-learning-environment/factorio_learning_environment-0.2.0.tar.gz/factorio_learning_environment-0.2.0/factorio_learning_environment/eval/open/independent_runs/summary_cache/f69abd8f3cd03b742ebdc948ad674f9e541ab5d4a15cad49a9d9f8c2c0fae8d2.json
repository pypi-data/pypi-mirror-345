{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 27.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (5.5, 27.0)\n- Steam engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (0.5, 30.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Stone Furnace Setup\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) and another inserter at position (16.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden chest at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting the inserters to the power network\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups with various fluid systems and statuses, connecting different parts of the setup to facilitate fluid movement.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. For example, attempting to place a boiler at (5.5, 27.0) while being at (0, 0) is too far. Move closer to the target position.\n\n### Errors When Placing Into a Tile Which Is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that you have the required items in your inventory. For example, ensure you have enough coal before trying to insert it into a boiler."}
