{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Stone Furnace Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 1.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 1.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to stone furnace at position (2.0, 0.0).\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Ensure that the target tile is not obstructed before attempting to place a chest. Check for nearby entities that might block placement.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect use of API\n- When using the `Position` object, ensure that you are accessing its attributes correctly. Avoid treating it as a callable object.\n- Ensure that all required modules and definitions are properly imported and defined. For example, avoid using undefined variables or functions like 'builtins'.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure there is sufficient iron ore in inventory to supply to furnaces. Regularly check and replenish resources as needed to maintain production.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, verify that the position is buildable and free from obstructions. Regularly check for available space and adjust placement strategies accordingly."}
