Verify adequate spacing and adjust placement direction to avoid interference with existing structures.\n  \n- Recipe Setting Errors:\n  \u2022 Confirm that the deployed assembler\u2019s reference is correctly assigned before attempting to set recipes to avoid undefined variable issues.\n  \n- Nearest Buildable Area Search Issues:\n  \u2022 Always treat position objects as data and ensure that any computed center positions are defined and accessible rather than mistakenly invoking them as functions.\n\n- Ingredient Supply Timing Error:\n  \u2022 The recurring warning \"cannot create copper-cable due to missing resources: copper-plate (1)\" indicates delays in supplying the required ingredient. Synchronize copper plate extraction and reinsertion to ensure the assembler\u2019s input inventory is promptly replenished.\n\n- Power Connectivity Issues:\n  \u2022 Persistent \"not receiving electricity\" warnings\u2014even after adding additional electric poles\u2014suggest connection lapses. Re-examine the electrical grid integration and validate that the newly placed poles are correctly connected to a functioning power network."}
