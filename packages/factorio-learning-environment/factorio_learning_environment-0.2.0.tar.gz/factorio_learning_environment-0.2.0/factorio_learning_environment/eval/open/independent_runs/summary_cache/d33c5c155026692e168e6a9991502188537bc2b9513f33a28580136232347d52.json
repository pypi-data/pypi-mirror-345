{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Multiple PipeGroups connecting these components, currently not connected properly.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a drop position at (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) storing iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with iron plate output\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with iron plate output\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Science Production and Research Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with Automation Science Packs but no research in progress\n- Inserter and Small Electric Poles not properly connected to the power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that each pipe segment is properly placed and connected to the intended entities.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connections\n- Verify that small electric poles are available in the inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network. Ensure that all entities requiring power are within the coverage area of the electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Research Setup\n- Ensure that research is set correctly in the lab. Verify that the lab is powered and has the necessary science packs to initiate research.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to connect entities or perform actions that require specific items, ensure that the necessary items are present in the inventory to avoid failed operations."}
