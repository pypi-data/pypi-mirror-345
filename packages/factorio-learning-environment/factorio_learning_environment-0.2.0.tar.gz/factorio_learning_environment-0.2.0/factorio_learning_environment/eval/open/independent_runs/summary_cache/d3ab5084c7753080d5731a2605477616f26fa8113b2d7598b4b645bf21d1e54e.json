{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network\n- Transport Belt network connecting furnaces and mining drill\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.5, -69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0)\n- Transport Belt network facilitating ore movement\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- Transport Belt network facilitating ore movement\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Transport Belts\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before attempting to place a transport belt. Clear any existing objects that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Entities\n- Verify the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. Ensure the coordinates are correct and the entity exists at that location.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of space.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all burner entities have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly refuel mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation."}
