{"content": "I see we now have 50 iron plates in our inventory! Let's use these to craft some automation components:\n\n```python\n# Check what we can craft with our iron plates\nprint(f\"Starting inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Let's craft some iron gear wheels first (they're needed for most automation)\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=5)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting gears: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Now let's craft a burner inserter\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter, quantity=1)\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting inserter: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Get our mining drill's position\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Mining drill position: {drill.position}, drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\n\n# Place the inserter between the drill and where we want items to go\ninserter_pos = Position(x=drill.position.x, y=drill.position.y + 1)\nmove_to(inserter_pos)\ninserter = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerInserter, position=inserter_pos)\n\n# Add fuel to the inserter\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Final entities: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis should help automate our mining drill output. We're:\n1. Using our iron plates to craft gear wheels (basic automation component)\n2. Crafting a burner inserter to help move items\n3. Placing the inserter to handle the mining drill's output\n4. Adding fuel to keep it running\n\nLet's see if this helps with our blocked mining drill situation!", "summary_range": "[1-128]"}
