{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Structure at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the adjacent wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a tile before attempting placement. Avoid collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water).\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Ensure the pickup and drop positions are accurately set to facilitate the intended transfer.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly transferring resources to the furnace. Verify that the inserter is fueled and properly aligned to deposit items into the furnace.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that fuel is available in the inventory and correctly distributed to all entities requiring it."}
