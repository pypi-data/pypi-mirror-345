{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -10.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities for steam and water transport\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) and Position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) with Inserter at Position (9.5, 5.5) feeding copper plates\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-3.5, 0.5) and (-3.5, 2.5) for storage\n- Inserters at various positions for item movement\n- Electricity Group providing power to various entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the entity you are trying to extract from contains the item. In this case, the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) did not contain copper cables, leading to an extraction error.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Resources\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for the production process. The Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) cannot create copper cables due to a shortage of copper plates."}
