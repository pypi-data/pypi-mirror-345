{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-9.5, -2.5) - Still disconnected (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Boiler** at (3.5, 0.0) - Still not receiving water (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Pipe Network** (system 16923):\n  - Pipes at (1.5, -0.5) and (1.5, -1.5)\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Updated)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Now visible with crude oil resources (300,000 units)\n  - Status: NO_POWER (not connected to power network)\n  - Connection points at (18.5, 38.5)\n\n### New Power Plant (Unchanged)\n- **Boiler** at (35.5, 47.0) - Fueled with coal but no water input\n- **Steam Engine** at (46.5, 40.5) - Connected to power pole but not receiving steam\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Unchanged)\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at (34.5, 20.5) - Connected to power pole\n- **Transport Belt System** moving coal (status: WORKING)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues (Updated)\n- Inventory mismatches (step 112) - Verify required items are in inventory before placement\n- Water placement violations (steps 114,116) - Implement dry-land verification before placement\n- Collision detection failures (step 117) - Check all nearby entities before placement attempts\n- Assertion failures (steps 113,114) - Validate placement conditions before asserting success\n\n### New API Usage Errors\n- Recipe requirement violation (step 115) - Set recipes before connecting to refineries\n- Direction method error (step 118) - Use correct Direction class methods (opposite \u2192 reverse)\n- Insertion failures (step 119) - Verify entity can accept items before insertion attempts\n\n### Construction Best Practices (Updated)\n1. Verify inventory contents before all placement operations\n2. Implement complete dry-land verification for all placements\n3. Check all nearby entities for potential collisions\n4. Set recipes before connecting processing buildings\n5. Use correct Direction class methods (reverse instead of opposite)\n6. Verify entity can accept items before insertion attempts\n7. Maintain proper distance (<10 tiles) during placements\n8. Clear entire pipe routes before connection attempts\n9. Validate placement conditions before asserting success\n10. Check connection point orientations match before connecting"}
