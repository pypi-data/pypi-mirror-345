LIDA FRAMEWORK SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

Upon execution of this Agreement by the party identified below (“Licensee”), The
University of Memphis (“Memphis”), on behalf of The Cognitive Computing Research
Group (“CCRG”) in the Institute for Intelligent Systems, will provide the cognitive
modeling software LIDA Framework in Executable Code and/or Source Code form
(“Software”) to Licensee, subject to the following terms and conditions. For purposes of
this Agreement, Executable Code is the compiled code, which is ready to run on
Licensee's computer. Source code consists of a set of files which contain the actual
program commands that are compiled to form the Executable Code.

1. The Software is intellectual property owned by Memphis, and all rights, title and
interest, including copyright, remain with Memphis. Memphis grants, and Licensee
hereby accepts, a restricted, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software
for academic, research and internal business purposes only i.e. not for commercial use
(see Paragraph 7 below), without a fee. Licensee agrees to reproduce the copyright notice
and other proprietary markings on all copies of the Software. Licensee has no right to
transfer or sublicense the Software to any unauthorized person or entity. However,
Licensee does have the right to make complimentary works that interoperate with the
LIDA Framework, to freely distribute such complimentary works, and to direct others to
the CCRG server to obtain copies of the LIDA Framework itself.

2. Licensee may, at its own expense, modify the Software to make derivative works, for
its own academic, research, and internal business purposes. Licensee's distribution of any
derivative work is also subject to the same restrictions on distribution and use limitations
that are specified herein for Memphis' Software. Prior to any such distribution the
Licensee shall require the recipient of the Licensee's derivative work to first obtain a
license for the LIDA Framework with Memphis in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Any derivative work should be clearly marked and
renamed to notify users that it is a modified version and not the original LIDA
Framework code distributed by Memphis.

3. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
“AS IS” AND MEMPHIS MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AND EXTENDS NO
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OR MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR THAT THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL
NOT INFRINGE ANY PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHTS. LICENSEE
ASSUMES THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE SOFTWARE AND/OR ASSOCIATED MATERIALS. LICENSEE AGREES
THAT MEMPHIS SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,

4. Licensee understands the Software is proprietary to Memphis. Licensee agrees to take
all reasonable steps to insure that the Software is protected and secured from
unauthorized disclosure, use, or release and will treat it with at least the same level of
care as Licensee would use to protect and secure its own proprietary computer programs
and/or information, but using no less than a reasonable standard of care. Licensee agrees
to provide the Software only to any other person or entity who has registered with
Memphis. If licensee is not registering as an individual but as an institution or
corporation each member of the institution or corporation who has access to or uses
Software must understand and agree to the terms of this license. If Licensee becomes
aware of any unauthorized licensing, copying or use of the Software, Licensee shall
promptly notify Memphis in writing. Licensee expressly agrees to use the Software only
in the manner and for the specific uses authorized in this Agreement.

all other applicable laws of the U.S. including, but not limited to, export control laws and
the terms of this license. Memphis shall have the right to terminate this license
immediately by written notice upon Licensee's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of
its terms. Licensee may be held legally responsible for any copyright infringement that is
caused or encouraged by its failure to abide by the terms of this license. Upon
termination, Licensee agrees to destroy all copies of the Software in its possession and to
verify such destruction in writing.

6. The user agrees that any reports or published results obtained with the Software will
acknowledge its use by the appropriate citation as follows:

7. Should Licensee wish to make commercial use of the Software, Licensee will contact
Memphis (ccrg@cs.memphis.edu) to negotiate an appropriate license for such use.

as such, CCRG encourages contributions from users of the code that might, at Memphis'

and/or useful product. Licensees that wish to contribute their code to become an internal
portion of the Software may be required to sign an “Agreement Regarding Contributory
Code for the LIDA Framework Software” before Memphis can accept it (contact
ccrg@cs.memphis.edu for a copy).
