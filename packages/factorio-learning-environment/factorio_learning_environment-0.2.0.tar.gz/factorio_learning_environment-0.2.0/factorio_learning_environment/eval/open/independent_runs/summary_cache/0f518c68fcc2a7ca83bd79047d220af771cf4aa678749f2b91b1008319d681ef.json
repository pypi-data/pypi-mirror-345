{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with coal as fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates. It is connected to the mining drill via a **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates. It is connected to a **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) which is waiting for space in the destination.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) used for storage of iron plates and iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not full before attempting to transfer items. Consider adding more storage or using the items in the destination to free up space.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary entities in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map. This will prevent errors related to missing items during placement attempts.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entity for the inserter has items available for transfer. Check the supply chain to ensure that resources are being delivered to the source entity efficiently.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly transfer items from furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Consider setting up automated systems to transfer items from furnaces to storage chests or other processing facilities."}
