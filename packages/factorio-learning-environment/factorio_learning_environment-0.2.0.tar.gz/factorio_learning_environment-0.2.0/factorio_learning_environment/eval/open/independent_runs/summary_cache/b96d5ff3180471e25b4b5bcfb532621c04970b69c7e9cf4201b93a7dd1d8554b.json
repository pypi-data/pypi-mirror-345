{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0), fueled by coal, extracting coal and depositing into:\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) with an inventory of 305 coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0), currently out of fuel, connected to:\n- Transport Belt group connecting positions (-25.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -65.5), transporting extracted resources.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0), fueled by coal, extracting iron ore and depositing into:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) with an inventory of 282 iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), fueled by coal, with no ingredients to smelt, and:\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5), waiting for source items, connected to:\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Group Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Belt Groups facilitating the transport of resources between various facilities, including:\n  - Belt Group from (-26.5, -65.5) to (-22.5, -65.5).\n  - Belt Group from (-23.5, -64.5) to (-21.5, -64.5).\n  - Belt Group from (-20.5, -64.5) to (-20.5, -66.5).\n  - Belt Group from (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Retrieving Entities\n- Ensure the entity type and position are correct when using the `get_entity` function. Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors with Function Arguments\n- When using functions that require arguments, ensure all required arguments are provided. Double-check the function signature to avoid missing arguments.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Usage\n- Ensure inserters have access to source items and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the intended source and destination entities."}
