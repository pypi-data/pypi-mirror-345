{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automated Power Generation near x=-2.0 y=1.5 and x=16.0 y=0.0\nThis structure combines the coal mining setup with the electricity generation setup, as they are now linked by a transport belt for automated boiler fueling. The boiler and steam engine are now working, but the electric pole placed to distribute power is not connected correctly.\nConsists of following entities:\n*   **Power Generation Components:**\n    *   Offshore Pump at position `x=-9.5 y=-0.5`\n    *   Boiler at position `x=-2.0 y=1.5` (Status: WORKING, Fuel: 5 coal)\n    *   Steam Engine at position `x=6.5 y=4.5` (Status: WORKING)\n    *   Pipe Group connecting the pump to the boiler (carrying water) starting near `x=-8.5 y=-0.5`\n    *   Pipe"}
