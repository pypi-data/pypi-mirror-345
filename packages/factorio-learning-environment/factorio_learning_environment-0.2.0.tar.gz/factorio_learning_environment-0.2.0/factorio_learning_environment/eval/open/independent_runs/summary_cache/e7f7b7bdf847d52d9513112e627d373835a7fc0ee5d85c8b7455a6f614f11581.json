Check the inventory of the entity before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Make sure the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory if necessary.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for space in the destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred. Regularly clear or expand storage to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors when attempting to harvest resources\n- Ensure that your inventory has enough space to accommodate the resources you intend to harvest. Clear space in your inventory before attempting to harvest more resources."}
