{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=0.5) intended to transfer iron plates, but currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Misalignment of Inserters\n- Ensure that the pickup and drop positions of inserters are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning properly.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Verify that inserters are correctly positioned and configured to transfer items between entities. Misconfiguration can lead to production bottlenecks or stoppages.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Ensure that the inserter feeding the furnace is correctly aligned and operational to prevent the furnace from running out of ingredients to smelt."}
