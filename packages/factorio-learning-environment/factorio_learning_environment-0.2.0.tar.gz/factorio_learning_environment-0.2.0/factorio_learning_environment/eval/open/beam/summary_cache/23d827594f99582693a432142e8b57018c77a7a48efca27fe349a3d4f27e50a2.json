The new stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) is now empty and still has 7 wood as fuel, but it has no ingredients to smelt.\n2. The other furnace at (-1.0, 2.0) has 15 wood but no ingredients to smelt.\n3. The last furnace at (1.0, 2.0) is out of fuel and cannot smelt anything.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. We need just **1 more iron plate** to reach a total of 5 iron plates, which is required to craft the burner mining drill.\n2. We can smelt the remaining 3 iron ore into plates using the new stone furnace.\n\nLet's insert the 3 iron ore back into the new stone furnace to smelt them into iron plates.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Insert the remaining 3 iron ore into the new stone furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, new_furnace, quantity=3)  # Add the remaining iron ore into the furnace\n\n# Check inventory after setting up the furnace again\nprint(f\"Inventory after inserting iron ore into the furnace: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Updated Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check the updated status of the entities after setup", "summary_range": "[1-76]"}
