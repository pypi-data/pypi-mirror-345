    """
    Iterates through filenames (also permitting '-' for stdin).
    Generates multi-line chunks, separated by a terminator.

    Args:
        filenames:
            Filenames (or '-' for stdin).
        chunk_terminator_line:
            Single-line string used to separate chunks within a file. If this
            is an empty string, then enter a blank line to terminate. If it is
            ``None``, then lines are yielded one by one (multi-line input is
            not possible).
        stdin_prompt:
            Optional prompt to show (to the log) before each request.

    Yields:
        str:
            Each chunk.
