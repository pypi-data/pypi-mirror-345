{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED, warnings include 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status NO_FUEL, warnings include 'out of fuel'.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING, supplying water to the system.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=26707) starting at position (x=9.5, y=15.5) with status EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=26717) starting at position (x=6.5, y=21.5) with status EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=26719) starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, carrying water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=48445) with poles distributed across positions such as (x=7.5, y=8.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), up to (x=35.5, y=24.5), with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure that there is a suitable position available for placing small electric poles. Check for obstructions or occupied tiles before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Verify the connectivity between pipes and target entities. Ensure that the path is clear and that the correct types of pipes are used for the intended connections. Specifically, ensure that the pipe connections from (x=1.5, y=21.5) to (x=17.5, y=20.5) are feasible and that the necessary infrastructure is in place.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(Position, Position, {Prototype})`: Attempts to connect entities using specified prototypes. Failure occurs if the path between entities is obstructed or incompatible.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of connected pipes, with types including `Pipe` and `UndergroundPipe`.\n- `electricity_group_id`: Identifier for the electricity network group, currently set to 48445."}
