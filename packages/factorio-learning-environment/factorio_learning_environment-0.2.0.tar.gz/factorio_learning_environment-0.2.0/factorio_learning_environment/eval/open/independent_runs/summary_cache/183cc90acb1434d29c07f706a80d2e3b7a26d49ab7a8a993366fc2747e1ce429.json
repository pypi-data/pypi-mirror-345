{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with fuel inventory containing 9 units of coal, currently working.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with fuel inventory containing 12 units of coal, currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with no fuel, currently not working due to being out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with fuel inventory containing 10 units of coal, currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. In step 947, an attempt was made to insert coal into the iron mining drill without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Both the stone furnace at (41.0, -80.0) and the stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) are not working due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n### Errors Due to No Fuel\n- Ensure that mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. The burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) is not working due to a lack of fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **iron_drill**: Attempted to insert coal into this variable, which failed due to insufficient coal in inventory.\n- **Variables**:\n  - `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n  - `coal`: Integer representing the quantity of coal in the inventory."}
