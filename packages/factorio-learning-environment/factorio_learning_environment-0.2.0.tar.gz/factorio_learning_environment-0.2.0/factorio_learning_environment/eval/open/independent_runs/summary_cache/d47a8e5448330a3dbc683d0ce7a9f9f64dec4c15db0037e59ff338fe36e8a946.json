{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 3.0)\n- Steam engine at position(1.5, 7.5)\n- Connected with pipe network between components\n- Currently operational but boiler is out of fuel\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Line at Position(18.5, 73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position(18.5, 73.5) mining iron ore\n- Transport belt at position(18.5, 75.5) at the drill output\n- Stone furnace at position(19.0, 77.0) with coal fuel\n- Assembling machine 2 at position(24.5, 77.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Wooden chest at position(27.5, 77.5) for output storage\n- Inserter at position(26.5, 77.5) to move finished gear wheels to chest\n- Small electric poles connecting all electrical components\n- Currently not fully operational due to missing connections between components\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces; use inserters as intermediaries\n- When creating belt paths, ensure there's a valid path between start and end positions\n- Check that belt placement positions are clear of obstacles\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Verify the target location is clear before placing entities\n- Some areas may be unplaceable due to water or other terrain features\n- Check for existing entities that might block placement\n- When repositioning components, ensure you have a clear understanding of the required space\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Ensure inserters are properly aligned with input/output positions\n- Check that inserter pickup and drop positions match with the intended source and target entities\n- Pay attention to inserter direction when placing\n\n### Factory design considerations\n- When building production lines, ensure proper spacing between components\n- Plan the layout to accommodate all required connections between entities\n- Consider rebuilding in a clear area if the current location has placement issues"}
