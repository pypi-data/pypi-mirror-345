{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0): This furnace is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is regularly refueled and monitored to ensure continuous operation. The furnace inventory frequently contains a mix of iron ore and iron plates, indicating ongoing production.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5): Used for storing coal, which is essential for fueling the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) and (62.5, -52.5): Additional storage for coal, ensuring a steady supply for the furnace operations.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0): This drill extracts coal, which is a critical resource for fueling various operations. It is regularly refueled to maintain productivity.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5): Transfers mined coal from the drill to the storage chests. It is currently waiting for source items, indicating a potential bottleneck in the supply chain.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5) and (42.5, -83.5): These chests store the mined coal, ensuring a buffer for future use.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to source items. Check the connectivity and alignment of the inserter with the source entity to prevent idle time.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly extract items from the furnace to prevent it from becoming full. This ensures continuous production without interruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources such as wood, coal, and iron plates.\n- `furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Monitors the contents of the furnace, including iron ore and iron plates.\n\nThe report reflects the current state of operations and highlights areas for improvement in resource management and production efficiency."}
