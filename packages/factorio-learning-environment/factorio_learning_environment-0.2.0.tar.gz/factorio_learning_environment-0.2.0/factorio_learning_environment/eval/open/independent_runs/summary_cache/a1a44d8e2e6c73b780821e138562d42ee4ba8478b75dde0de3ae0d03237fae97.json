{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mine at position (41, -82)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (41, -82) and two chests at positions (40.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Transport System\nConsists of a burner inserter at position (39.5, -81.5) that picks up coal from the mining drill and drops it at position (39.5, -80.5).\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (0, 0) with a fuel source of coal.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when inserting coal into the burner mining drill**: Make sure the drill's inventory is not full before attempting to insert coal. Check the drill's status and ensure it is not waiting for space in the destination chest.\n* **Errors when extracting coal from the coal chest**: Ensure the chest is not empty and the agent has the necessary permissions to extract items from the chest.\n* **Errors when the furnace fuel source is full**: Ensure the furnace is not full of fuel before attempting to add more coal.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* **Important variables**:\n\t+ `coal_chest`: a chest entity for storing coal\n\t+ `drill`: a burner mining drill entity for mining coal\n\t+ `furnace`: a stone furnace entity for smelting items\n\t+ `inserter`: a burner inserter entity for transporting coal\n* **Utility functions**:\n\t+ `extract_item`: a function for extracting items from a chest\n\t+ `insert_item`: a function for inserting items into a drill or furnace\n\tNote: These functions have been invoked and have resulted in errors due to full inventories or lack of ingredients."}
