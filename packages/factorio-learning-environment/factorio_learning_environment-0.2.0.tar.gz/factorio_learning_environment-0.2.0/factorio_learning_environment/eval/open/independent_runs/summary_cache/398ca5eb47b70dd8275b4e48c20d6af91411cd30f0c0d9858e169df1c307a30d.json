{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of four stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have coal as fuel but currently have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected by two pipe groups:\n  - Water input pipes from pump to boiler\n  - Steam output pipes from boiler to steam engine\nCurrently the boiler is out of fuel and steam engine is not connected to power network.\n\n### Research Lab at (10.5, 0.5)\n- Lab containing 2 automation science packs\n- Connected to power network via electric poles\n- Currently working status\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to insert them into machines\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to craft complex items\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Cannot place entities without having them in inventory first (e.g., offshore pump placement attempt)\n- Ensure you have crafted required building components before attempting placement\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Errors\n- Some items cannot be crafted by hand and require specific machines:\n  - Copper plates and iron plates require smelting in furnaces\n  - Electronic components require assembling machines\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered, not crafted\n\n### Power System Errors\n- Ensure all power components are properly connected\n- Maintain fuel supply in boilers\n- Complete power network connections before expecting machines to work\n\n### Programming/API Errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations on ModelPrivateAttr objects (error with BuildingBox width calculation)\n- Ensure proper type handling when working with game object properties"}
