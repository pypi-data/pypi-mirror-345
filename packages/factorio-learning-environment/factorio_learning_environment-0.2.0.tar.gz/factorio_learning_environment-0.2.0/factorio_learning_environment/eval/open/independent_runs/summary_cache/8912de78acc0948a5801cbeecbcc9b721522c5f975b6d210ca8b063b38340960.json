In this case, the Assembling Machine 1 requires Automation technology.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a target location before attempting to place it. If the location is occupied or unplaceable (e.g., water), the placement will fail.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Make sure the entity you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position. If it does not exist, you will receive an error indicating that no entity of that type was found.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that there is a valid connection path between the lab and the small electric pole to provide power. If the connection fails, check for any obstacles or unconnected paths."}
