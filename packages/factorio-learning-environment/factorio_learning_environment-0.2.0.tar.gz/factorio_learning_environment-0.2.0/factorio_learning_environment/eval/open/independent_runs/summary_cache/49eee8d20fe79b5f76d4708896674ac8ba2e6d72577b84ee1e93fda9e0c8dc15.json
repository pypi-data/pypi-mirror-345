{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and another at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Multiple Burner Inserters:\n  - Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n  - Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5)\n  - Inserter at position (-13.5, -45.5)\n- Transport Belts:\n  - Belt group from position (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5)\n  - Belt group from position (-12.5, -44.5) to (-12.5, -46.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a steady supply of source items. Check the connections and supply chains leading to the inserters to ensure they are not starved of materials.\n\n#### No Iron Plates Available for Extraction\n- Verify that the production of iron plates is continuous and that there are no blockages in the transport belts or furnaces. Ensure that the furnaces are supplied with iron ore and fuel.\n\n#### Error When Inserting Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n#### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Make sure there is a destination entity available to accept items from inserters. If the output is blocked, adjust the setup to ensure that items can be moved away from the inserter's drop position.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the efficiency of the production lines can be improved, reducing downtime and increasing output."}
