{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Frequent repositioning indicates potential misalignment.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Ensure the inserter is operational and properly fueled.\n\n### Errors with Chest Inventory Management\n- Regularly monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Consider expanding storage or processing capacity if the chest frequently fills up.\n\n### Extraction Errors Due to Empty Chest\n- Ensure there is a sufficient quantity of iron ore in the chest before attempting to extract. Avoid extraction attempts when the chest is empty to prevent errors.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly refuel inserters and drills to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of coal or other fuel sources to avoid interruptions."}
