{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-5.0, y=2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) facing RIGHT\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.0, y=2.5) facing RIGHT (currently out of fuel)\n- Steam engine at position (x=0.5, y=6.5) facing RIGHT\n- Small electric pole at position (x=0.5, y=8.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting (around x=18.5, y=74.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (x=18.5, y=74.5) facing DOWN\n- Stone furnace at position (x=19.0, y=77.0) with coal fuel\n- Inserter at position (x=19.5, y=78.5) facing DOWN\n- Small electric pole at position (x=20.5, y=77.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (x=17.5, y=72.5)\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting (around x=-48.5, y=79.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (x=-48.5, y=79.5) facing DOWN\n- Stone furnace at position (x=-48.0, y=82.0) with coal fuel\n- Inserter at position (x=-47.5, y=83.5) facing DOWN\n- Small electric pole at position (x=-46.5, y=77.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (x=-46.5, y=82.5)\n\n### Electronic Circuit Production (around x=10.5, y=18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine for copper cables at position (x=7.5, y=18.5)\n- Assembling machine for electronic circuits at position (x=13.5, y=18.5)\n- Inserter for copper plates at position (x=5.5, y=18.5) facing LEFT\n- Inserter to transfer copper cables at position (x=9.5, y=18.5) facing RIGHT\n- Inserter at position (x=10.5, y=18.5) facing RIGHT\n- Output inserter at position (x=15.5, y=18.5) facing RIGHT (no power)\n- Output wooden chest at position (x=16.5, y=18.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (x=4.5, y=18.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nAn extensive electricity network connecting all powered structures with multiple small electric poles distributed across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Always check if a tile is already occupied before placing an entity\n- When placing electric poles near machines, place them adjacent to but not directly on top of other entities\n- Use `place_entity_next_to` with appropriate spacing parameters to avoid collisions\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly from furnaces - use an inserter as an intermediary\n- When connecting belts to inserters, ensure the inserter's pickup position is not already occupied\n- Check that the target position for belt connections is clear of other entities\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are not blocked by other entities\n- When placing inserters near assembling machines, check that they don't overlap with the machine's working area\n- Consider the direction and orientation of inserters relative to the entities they interact with\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Make sure all electrical devices are connected to the power network\n- Place electric poles within reach of all electrical devices\n- Remember that unpowered inserters won't function\n\n### Automation workflow issues\n- When creating automated systems, plan the layout carefully to avoid entity conflicts\n- Consider the complete workflow from resource extraction to final product\n- Use chests as buffers between production stages when direct connections aren't possible"}
