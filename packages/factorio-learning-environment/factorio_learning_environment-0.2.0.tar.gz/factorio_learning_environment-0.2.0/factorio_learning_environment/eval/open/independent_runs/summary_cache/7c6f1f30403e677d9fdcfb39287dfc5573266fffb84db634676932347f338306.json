{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-24.5, -69.5) facilitating the transfer of resources.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items between chests.\n\n### Belt Transport System\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup from (x=-21.5, y=-63.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-66.5) for item transport.\n- BeltGroup from (x=-17.5, y=-62.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) for item transport.\n- BeltGroup from (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-58.5) for item transport.\n- BeltGroup from (x=-14.5, y=-62.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-65.5) for item transport.\n- BeltGroup from (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-59.5) for item transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Placement\n- Ensure there are no gaps in belt placement. Verify the continuity of belt lines to avoid connection errors.\n- When placing belts, ensure the target tile is not occupied by another object. Check the area is clear before placement.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Make sure inserters have a clear path to pick up and drop items. Check for obstructions and ensure inserters are properly aligned with source and destination entities.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner entities to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes. Regularly refuel entities to maintain efficiency."}
