Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft.\n- The agent attempted to craft a `burner-mining-drill` which requires `stone-furnace`, but the agent did not have enough `stone` to craft the `stone-furnace`. Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- The agent attempted to insert `iron-ore` into a furnace but had no `iron-ore` in its inventory. Ensure the item exists in the inventory before attempting to insert it.\n- The agent attempted to insert `coal` into a drill, but had no `coal` in its inventory. Ensure the item exists in the inventory before attempting to insert it.\n- The agent attempted to insert `coal` into an inserter, but had no `coal` in its inventory. Ensure the item exists in the inventory before attempting to insert it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- The agent attempted to place a `burner-mining-drill` at a position where an entity already exists. Ensure the target position is free before attempting to place an entity.\n- The agent attempted to place a `wooden-chest` next to a drill, but a `stone-furnace` was already present at the intended location. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position.\n- The agent attempted to place a `stone-furnace` next to a drill, but a `wooden-chest` was already present at the intended location. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position.\n- The agent attempted to place a `wooden-chest` next to an inserter, but a `wooden-chest` was already present at the intended location.
