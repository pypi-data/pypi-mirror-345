{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. The agent repeatedly attempted to deploy a Lab (intended for supplying Automation Science Packs for research) at position (0.5, 2.5), but these attempts failed due to missing lab items in the inventory and insufficient resources for crafting the necessary sub-ingredients. Although references were made to an iron smelting furnace at position (5.0, 5.0) and a copper smelting furnace at position (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for resource processing, these were pre\u2010existing entities and were not newly placed structures by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors:\n  - When calling get_entities, avoid unsupported parameters. In one case a keyword argument (\u2018radius\u2019) was used even though the function does not support it, and in another the wrong number of positional arguments was passed. Always check the API\u2019s signature to ensure proper usage.\n  - Before iterating over results from get_entities, validate that the returned value is not None (or default to an empty list) to prevent iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Issues:\n  - Confirm that the required item (e.g., a Lab) exists in the inventory before attempting to place it. Failure to do so leads to placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and Resource Management:\n  - Verify that all prerequisite ingredients and sub-components (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available before attempting to craft complex items like the Lab.\n  - Ensure that the production chain (including necessary smelting or crafting facilities) is fully operational so that all dependencies are met prior to initiating a crafting operation."}
