{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore (currently out of fuel)\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates (currently out of fuel and no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace (has coal fuel)\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine (has coal fuel but output blocked)\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine (has coal fuel, chest is full)\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels (currently full)\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates (not receiving electricity, no power)\n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) providing electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters (power network voltage 0)\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, the burner mining drill and furnace are out of fuel, and the assembler is not powered, halting production.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to assembler not receiving power\n- The assembling machine remains without power despite attempts to connect electric poles.\n- Verify that electric poles are properly connected in a continuous power network and that the poles have power input.\n- Check that the assembler\u2019s connection points are within pole coverage and that poles are energized.\n- Ensure power poles have sufficient voltage and are connected to a power source.\n\n### Errors related to fuel insertion and inventory management\n- Multiple failures occurred when attempting to insert coal into burner inserters and other entities due to \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n- Ensure sufficient coal is harvested and available in the player inventory before inserting fuel into burner entities.\n- Manage coal inventory carefully to avoid depletion during fuel insertion steps.\n- Avoid attempting to insert items when inventory is empty to prevent exceptions.\n\n### Errors placing transport belts due to inventory shortage or occupied tiles\n- Attempts to place transport belts failed due to lack of transport belts in inventory or occupied tiles.\n- Maintain adequate inventory of transport belts before placement attempts.\n- Before placing belts, check that the target tile is free and not occupied by other entities.\n- Adjust placement positions or clear obstructing entities to enable belt placement.\n\n### Errors caused by full output storage\n- The wooden chest at (18.5, 73.5) is full, causing burner inserters feeding from the assembler output to wait.\n- Regularly empty storage chests or expand storage capacity to prevent output blockages.\n- Monitor inserter status to detect and resolve output congestion.\n\n### General tips to mitigate placement, power, and fuel errors\n- Confirm entity inventories and player inventory contain required items before insertion or placement.\n- Verify power network connectivity and energy levels of poles and electric machines.\n- Manage fuel supply proactively to keep burner entities operational.\n- Check for entity collisions or occupied tiles before placing new entities.\n- Regularly monitor entity statuses and warnings to identify and fix production halts early.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
