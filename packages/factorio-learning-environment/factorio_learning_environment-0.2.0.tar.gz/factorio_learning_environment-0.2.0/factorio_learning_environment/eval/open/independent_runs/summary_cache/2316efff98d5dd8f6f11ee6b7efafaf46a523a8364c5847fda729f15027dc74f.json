{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5) - currently working\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=4.0) - intermittently working, frequently running out of fuel\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=7.5) - intermittently working when boiler has fuel\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole (x=1.5, y=7.5)\n\nThe system is experiencing frequent power outages due to the boiler running out of fuel. The agent has been adding coal to the boiler in steps 120, 123, and 126, but it quickly runs out. When the power is on, the system produces approximately 27 water/steam per 60 seconds.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (x=18.5, y=73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=18.5, y=73.5) mining iron ore - intermittently working due to power outages\n- Wooden chest (x=18.5, y=75.5) collecting iron ore from the drill (currently contains 784 iron ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=19.0, y=77.0) with coal, currently working with iron ore\n- Inserter (x=19.5, y=78.5) to move iron plates from furnace to chest - not working due to power outages\n- Wooden chest (x=19.5, y=79.5) for iron plate storage (currently empty as of step 127)\n- Chest output inserter (x=19.5, y=80.5) to extract plates from chest - not working due to power outages\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=19.5, y=81.5) with belts extending to (x=14.5, y=78.5) - currently contains 32 iron plates\n- Additional belt system from (x=8.5, y=75.5) to (x=9.5, y=77.5) connecting to the circuit assembly\n- Small electric poles (x=21.5, y=73.5), (x=20.5, y=75.5), (x=21.5, y=78.5), (x=21.5, y=80.5)\n\nThe system is producing iron plates at a rate of approximately 9-11 plates per 60 seconds when power is available. The agent has been manually extracting iron plates from the belt to clear it and feed the circuit assembler.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (x=-48.5, y=78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=-48.5, y=78.5) mining copper ore - intermittently working due to power outages\n- Wooden chest (x=-48.5, y=80.5) collecting copper ore from the drill (currently contains 783 copper ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=-48.0, y=82.0) with coal, currently working with copper ore\n- Inserter (x=-47.5, y=83.5) to move copper plates from furnace to chest - not working due to power outages\n- Wooden chest (x=-47.5, y=84.5) for copper plate storage (currently empty as of step 127)\n- Chest output inserter (x=-47.5, y=85.5) to extract plates from chest - not working due to power outages\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=-47.5, y=86.5) extending to (x=-22.5, y=86.5) - currently contains 103 copper plates\n- Small electric poles (x=-45.5, y=78.5), (x=-46.5, y=80.5), (x=-45.5, y=83.5), (x=-45.5, y=85.5)\n\nThe system is producing copper plates at a rate of approximately 10-11 plates per 60 seconds when power is available. The agent has been manually extracting copper plates from the belt to clear it and feed the cable assembler.\n\n### Circuit Production System\nConsists of:\n\n#### Copper Cable Assembly (x=-6.5, y=74.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (x=-"}
