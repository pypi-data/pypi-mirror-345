{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest, with segments at positions (-24.5, -69.5), (-22.5, -69.5), (-21.5, -68.5), (-21.5, -69.5), (-24.5, -66.5), (-23.5, -66.5), (-21.5, -67.5).\n- Additional Wooden Chests at positions (-24.5, -67.5) and (-23.5, -69.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the chest to another Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Transport Belt network facilitating movement of resources, with segments at positions (-12.5, -55.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates and ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) transferring items between chests at positions (-16.5, -64.5) and (-14.5, -64.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Undefined or Misused Entities\n- Ensure that all entity names are correctly defined and imported before use. For example, use 'burner_mining_drill' instead of 'BurnerMiningDrill' to avoid NameError.\n\n### Errors Related to Attribute Access\n- Verify that the objects being accessed have the correct attributes. For instance, ensure that entities like BeltGroup have a 'prototype' attribute before attempting to access it to avoid AttributeError.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chests or entities have items available for inserters to pick up. Check the inventory status and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and clear out full chests to prevent mining drills and inserters from stopping due to lack of space."}
