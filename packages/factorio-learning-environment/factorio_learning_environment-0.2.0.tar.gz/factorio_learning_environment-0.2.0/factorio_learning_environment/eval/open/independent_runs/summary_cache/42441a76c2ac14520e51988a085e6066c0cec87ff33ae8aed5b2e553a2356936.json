{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully established on the map. Several attempts were made to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but each placement or crafting effort failed due to missing inventory items and unavailable resources. Other operations (such as using existing furnaces for smelting) were performed on pre\u2010existing game entities rather than through agent\u2013initiated structure placement.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Errors for Entity Retrieval  \n\u2003\u2013 Avoid supplying unsupported keyword arguments (for example, do not use \u201cradius\u201d when the API expects no keyword parameters).  \n\u2003\u2013 Match the function\u2019s signature exactly; using positional arguments when the function is defined to take none will trigger errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the required Lab item is present in inventory before attempting placement.  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that resource prerequisites (such as sufficient iron-plates, iron-gear-wheels, copper-cables, and electronic-circuits) are met prior to and during lab crafting.  \n\u2003\u2013 Check that all sub\u2013ingredient production processes are operational (e.g., proper furnace smelting setups) so that lab crafting does not fail due to missing intermediary products.\n\n\u2022 Iterating over Non\u2013Iterable Results  \n\u2003\u2013 Before performing iterations on entities (like filtering labs), confirm that the retrieval function returns a valid list rather than None to avoid \u201cNoneType\u201d iteration errors."}
