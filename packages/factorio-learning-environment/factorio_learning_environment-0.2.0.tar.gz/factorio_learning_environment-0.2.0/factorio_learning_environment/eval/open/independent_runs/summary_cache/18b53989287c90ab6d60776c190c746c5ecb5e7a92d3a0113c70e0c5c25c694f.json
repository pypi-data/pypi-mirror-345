{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0) - currently not fueled and not connected properly.\n- Offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5) - working and connected to the fluid system.\n- Pipe groups connecting various entities in the fluid network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) - idle and has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) - idle and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Lab at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 0.0, 0.0) - currently has no power and is set for automation research.\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position not specified) - connected to the copper plate production line.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. For example, the boiler could not be placed at (-4.5, 23.0) because an entity already exists there.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Make sure that the entities you are trying to connect are within the correct distance and that the connection points are valid. The attempt to connect the boiler to the steam engine failed due to improper positioning of the pipes.\n\n### Errors related to fueling and power\n- Always check that your boiler is fueled before attempting to connect it to other entities. The boiler was not fueled and was not connected properly to the steam engine, leading to warnings about its status.\n\n### Errors when inserting into idle furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt before inserting items. The furnace at (0.0, 0.0) was idle and had no ingredients to smelt."}
