{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Smelting Setup at position (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at (-13.0, -50.0) used in smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Output Burner Inserter at (-14.5, -51.5) positioned to extract ore from the sink chest.\n- Input Burner Inserter at (-16.5, -49.5) placed to insert ore into the furnace.\n- An attempted transport belt connection from (\u201113.5, \u201151.5) to (\u201117.5, \u201149.5) to link the inserters, which remains unconnected due to missing required items.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup with Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at (-15.0, -50.0) actively mining iron ore.\n- Sink Wooden Chest at (-15.5, -51.5) placed to collect ore from the drill\u2019s output.\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Extraction Failures from Sink Chest: Repeated extraction errors occurred when attempting to extract iron ore from the sink chest that lacked the expected resource. Verify that ore is present in the chest before extraction.\n- Inserter Placement Collisions: Burner inserter placement attempts failed due to occupied target tiles. Adjust spacing, change direction, or modify reference positions to avoid conflicts.\n- Furnace Production Timeout: Furnace production did not reach the expected iron plate count, leading to timeouts. Ensure a consistent ore supply and avoid extraction errors to maintain smelting efficiency.\n- Missing Inventory Items for Belt Connection: An error in connecting the transport belt was observed because the required item was missing in inventory. Confirm necessary items are available before attempting entity connections."}
