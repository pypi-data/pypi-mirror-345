{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel (8 coal) and input (5 iron ore). It is currently working and producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to craft entities. In this case, there were not enough resources to craft an Assembling Machine.\n- Always check your inventory for required items before executing crafting actions to avoid running into resource shortages.\n- If an assertion error occurs indicating a lack of items, verify your inventory and ensure you have the necessary components before proceeding with actions that depend on those items.\n- When attempting to craft items that require sub-ingredients (e.g., Iron Gear Wheel requires Iron Plate), ensure you have the means to produce those sub-ingredients, such as a furnace or crafting machine.\n- Ensure that the furnace has enough fuel and input materials before starting the smelting process to avoid smelting timeouts.\n- Be mindful of the furnace inventory to avoid extracting more items than available.\n- When checking required ingredients for crafting, ensure you have enough of each required component to avoid crafting failures."}
