{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Three stone furnaces located at positions:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Each furnace is supplied with iron ore and coal for smelting iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) used for storing mined iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal available to refuel mining drills and furnaces. This will prevent interruptions in mining and smelting operations.\n- Maintain a steady supply of iron ore to furnaces to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning.\n\n#### Errors from full inventory\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full drop positions.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron ore available for smelting.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal available for fueling entities.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron plates produced and available in inventory."}
