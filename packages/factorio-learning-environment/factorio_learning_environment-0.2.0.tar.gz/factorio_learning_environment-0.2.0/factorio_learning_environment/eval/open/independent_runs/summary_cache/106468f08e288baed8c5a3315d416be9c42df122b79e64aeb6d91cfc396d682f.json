{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)**: Currently working, fueled with coal, and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)**: No ingredients to smelt, fueled with coal.\n- **Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)**: No ingredients to smelt, fueled with coal, furnace fuel source is full.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0)**: Out of fuel, chest at drop position is full. Neighbors include a wooden chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests**: Positioned at (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), and (x=4.5, y=-58.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in your inventory to refuel the burner mining drill. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Full Chest at Drop Position\n- The chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is full. Regularly empty the chest to allow continued mining operations and prevent stoppages.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to smelt. Check the supply chain and ensure that iron ore is being delivered to the furnaces consistently.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the current steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n  - `wooden-chest`: int\n\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
