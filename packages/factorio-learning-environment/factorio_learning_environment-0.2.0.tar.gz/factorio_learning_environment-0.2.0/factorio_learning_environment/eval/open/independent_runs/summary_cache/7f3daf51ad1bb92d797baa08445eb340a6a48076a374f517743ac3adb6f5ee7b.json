{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(10, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position 10.0, 0.0) \n\n### Copper plate mine at position(1, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 1.0, 1.0) and a furnace (position 1.0, 1.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(8, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position 8.5, 1.5) and burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position 1.0, 1.0 to the assembling machine at position 8.5, 1.5\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) and connected pipes (position -9.5, 23.5), (position -9.5, 22.5)\n\n### Electricity group at position(43.5, 32.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric poles at positions (43.5, 32.5), (47.5, 32.5), (56.5, 33.5), (52.5, 49.0), (52.5, 54.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that cannot accommodate the pole (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. In this case, ensure that a steam engine is present at position (10.0, 0.0) before calling `get_entity`.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
