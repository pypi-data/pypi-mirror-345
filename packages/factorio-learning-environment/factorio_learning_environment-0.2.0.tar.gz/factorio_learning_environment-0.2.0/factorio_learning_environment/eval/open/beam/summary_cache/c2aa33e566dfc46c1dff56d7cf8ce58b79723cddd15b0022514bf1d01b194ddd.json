{"content": "\"\"\"\nAfter waiting for the smelting process to complete, it appears that the furnace has not produced any copper plates yet. Instead, there are still 3 pieces of copper ore remaining in the furnace, and the output inventory still shows 3 iron plates. The furnace is currently in a 'FULL_OUTPUT' status, indicating that it has completed its processing cycle but has not yet converted the copper ore into plates.\n\nMy current inventory remains unchanged:\n- 5 pieces of coal\n- 5 pieces of stone\n- 3 pieces of iron plates\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Copper Ore Not Processed**: The furnace seems to be stuck on processing copper ore. This could be due to the furnace type or the recipe not being available for copper plates.\n2. **Iron Plates**: The furnace has successfully produced iron plates, but I need to ensure that I can also smelt copper ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Furnace Recipes**: I should verify if the stone furnace can smelt copper ore into copper plates. If not, I may need to build a different type of furnace (like a steel furnace) that can handle copper ore.\n2. **Gather More Resources**: While waiting for the furnace to process, I could gather more resources or explore other crafting options.\n\nLet's check the available recipes for the stone furnace to confirm if it can smelt copper ore into copper plates.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the available recipes for the stone furnace\navailable_recipes = get_furnace_recipes(stone_furnace)\nprint(f\"Available recipes for the stone furnace: {available_recipes}\")", "summary_range": "[1-74]"}
