{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(x=42.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=42.0, y=-83.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=43.5, y=-81.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=42.5, y=-80.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting fuel into the Stone Furnace\n- The furnace result is full. Ensure to manage the output inventory of the furnace to avoid this issue.\n\n### Errors when inserting fuel into the Burner Mining Drill\n- The chest at the drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for items\n- Check the source inventory for items and ensure it has enough to fulfill the inserter's request.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: Inventory (type: dict)\n- `iron-ore`: Inventory (type: dict)\n- `iron-plate`: Inventory (type: dict)"}
