{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at positions around (16.0, 71.0) to (18.5, 75.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a mining-to-smelting line for iron ore:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 72.5) collecting iron ore from the drill\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 73.5) feeding iron ore from the chest into the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 74.5) extracting iron plates from the furnace\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 75.5) collecting iron plates from the inserter\n- Small electric poles placed near furnace and inserters for power supply, though connection to one inserter at (18.5, 74.5) is partially failing\n\nThis structure is designed to automate iron ore mining, smelting, and collection of iron plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Direction argument type error when placing entities\n- When placing entities with direction, ensure the direction argument is of the correct Direction enum type, not a raw integer or other type. Use Direction.UP, Direction.DOWN, etc., directly.\n\n### Power pole connection failures due to nil or missing fields\n- When connecting power poles between entities, verify that both source and target entities are valid and fully initialized.\n- Check that the connection function handles cases where an entity might be missing expected attributes to avoid nil indexing errors.\n- Ensure power poles are placed close enough to entities to allow connection.\n\n### Missing output chest detection\n- Before accessing output chests, assert their existence carefully. If an output chest is expected but not found, add checks to handle this gracefully or create the chest beforehand.\n\n### Inventory availability for placing assembling machines\n- Confirm that the required items (e.g., assembling-machine-2) are present in inventory before attempting to place them to avoid placement failures.\n\n### Fueling inserters and machines to avoid waiting states\n- Inserters and furnaces showed warnings about being out of fuel and waiting for source items. Make sure to keep fuel supplied to burner inserters and burner furnaces to maintain operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
