This indicates that I need to gather more resources before I can continue with crafting or rebuilding the furnace.\n\n### Summary of the Situation:\n- The furnace is not processing copper ore, and the attempt to dismantle and rebuild it has led to an inability to craft a new one due to missing stone.\n- The current inventory includes:\n  - 3 iron plates\n  - 1 iron gear wheel\n  - 4 copper ore (still in the furnace)\n  - No stone available for crafting a new furnace.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Gather Stone**: I need to collect stone from the environment. This will allow me to craft a new furnace and continue processing copper ore.\n2. **Explore Other Resources**: While gathering stone, I can also look for other materials that might be useful for crafting.\n3. **Check for Nearby Resources**: If there are any nearby deposits of stone or other ores, I should prioritize those to expedite the gathering process.\n\nLet's proceed to gather stone from the environment.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Gather stone from nearby resources\ngather_resource(Prototype.Stone, quantity=5)  # Attempt to gather some stone\n\n# After gathering, check the inventory again to confirm the resources collected\nprint(f\"Current inventory after gathering: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory to see if stone has been collected.", "summary_range": "[1-104]"}
