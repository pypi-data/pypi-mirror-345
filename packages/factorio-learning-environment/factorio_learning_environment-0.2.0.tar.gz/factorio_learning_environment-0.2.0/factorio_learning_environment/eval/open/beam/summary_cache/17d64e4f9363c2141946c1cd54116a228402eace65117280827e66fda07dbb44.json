{"content": "I notice a pattern in the errors:\n1. We have coal in our inventory (10 pieces)\n2. We can successfully add coal to the mining drill\n3. We can successfully add coal to the furnace\n4. We fail when trying to add coal to the inserter\n5. The furnace and inserter are being placed at y=30.0 and y=30.5 instead of y=29.0\n\nLet's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# First, let's fuel the unfueled mining drill\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\ndrill = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\nif drill:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=2)\n    print(f\"Added fuel to mining drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n# Craft a burner inserter if we don't have one\nif 'burner-inserter' not in inventory:\n    craft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter)\n    print(\"Crafted burner inserter\")\n\n# Craft a stone furnace\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nprint(\"Crafted stone furnace\")\n\n# Now place the furnace at the correct height\nmove_to(Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0))\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0),\n    direction=Direction.UP\n)\n\nif furnace:\n    print(f\"Placed new furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    # Add fuel to the furnace (use less coal)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=2)\n    print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n    # Place the inserter at the correct position\n    inserter_pos = Position(x=-11.0, y=29.0)\n    move_to(inserter_pos)\n    input_inserter = place_entity(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n        position=inserter_pos,\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT\n    )\n    \n    if input_inserter:\n        print(f\"Added input inserter at {input_inserter.position}\")\n        # Try with less coal\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, input_inserter, quantity=2)\n        print(\"Added fuel to input inserter\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Current entities: {entities}\")\n```\n\nChanges made:\n1. Reduced coal quantities to ensure we don't run out\n2. Added explicit crafting of burner inserter\n3. Specified exact coordinates for inserter placement\n4. Changed inserter direction to RIGHT\n5. Removed place_entity_next_to in favor of explicit positioning\n\nLet's see if this resolves the issues we're seeing.", "summary_range": "[1-832]"}
