{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates and intermediate buffering.\n- Two burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), both fueled with coal, moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved fuel supply to inserters and stable power connectivity, though output belt blockage at furnace persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly connected pole at (8.95, 13.05) linked to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), now connected to power network and working, producing iron gear wheels.\n- Input wooden chest at (25.5, 78.5) placed to supply iron plates to assembler.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) placed to receive assembling machine output.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled with coal, moving items from output chest.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5) connected to power network.\n- Improved inserter and chest arrangement allowing smooth input and output flow.\n\nThis structure is now operational with power and fuel supplied, enabling iron gear wheel production with buffered input and output chests.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous attempts to place burner inserters and poles failed due to tile occupation.\n- These were resolved by removing obstructing wooden chest and repositioning inserters and poles.\n- Always verify tile occupancy before placement; remove or relocate obstructing entities as needed.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) initially out of fuel or empty, causing stoppage.\n- Agent successfully inserted coal into these inserters, restoring operation.\n- Maintain regular fuel insertion into burner inserters to avoid downtime.\n- Monitor inserter inventories to prevent insertion failures due to full inventories.\n\n### Crafting and recipe input supply issues\n- Assembling machine initially lacked iron plates and power, preventing crafting.\n- Agent connected assembler to power network and supplied iron plates via new input chest at (25.5, 78.5).\n- Despite input chest supply, assembler input inventory often remained empty, indicating possible insertion timing or routing issues.\n- Ensure inserters feeding assembler are correctly positioned and powered.\n- Confirm input chests contain sufficient materials and inserters are active to maintain assembler input.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" indicating output congestion.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, halting smelting output.\n- Agent extracted iron plates from chests regularly, but blockage persists.\n- To mitigate, improve belt throughput or add additional storage/output capacity downstream of furnace.\n- Verify all electric poles remain connected to power network to ensure continuous operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by agent."}
