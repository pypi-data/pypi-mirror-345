{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron ore chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) containing iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-10.5, y=-49.5) used for transferring iron ore from the iron ore chest and coal from another location.\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Coal chest at position (x=54.5, y=-78.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-10.5, y=-49.5) used for transferring coal from the coal chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) used for producing iron plates. Currently, the furnace inventory is full with iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory (e.g., stone furnace) has enough space before attempting to insert items. Consider checking the inventory status and clearing or expanding it if necessary.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron ore in the chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n- `target_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal and iron ore in the wooden chest at position (x=-10.5, y=-49.5).\n- `coal_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal in the chest at position (x=54.5, y=-78.5).\n- `stone_furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron plates in the stone furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)."}
