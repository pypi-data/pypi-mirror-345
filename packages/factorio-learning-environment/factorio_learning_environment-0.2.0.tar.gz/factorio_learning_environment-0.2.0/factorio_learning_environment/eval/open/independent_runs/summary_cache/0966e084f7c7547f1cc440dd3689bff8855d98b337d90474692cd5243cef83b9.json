{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0)\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0)\n\nThese furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates, which are essential for crafting and building other structures.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing 800 units of coal\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) to move coal from the mining drill to the chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for additional storage\n\nThis facility is used to extract coal, which is a critical fuel source for furnaces and other machinery.\n\n### Coal Storage Chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) containing 5 units of coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) containing 5 units of coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) containing 5 units of coal\n\nThese chests are used to store coal, ensuring a steady supply for various processes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory in Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills and inserters from halting operations due to full inventory. Specifically, empty the chest at position (40.5, -83.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that there are items available at the source position for the inserter to pick up. This can be resolved by maintaining a steady supply of resources to the source position.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the player, including items like 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
