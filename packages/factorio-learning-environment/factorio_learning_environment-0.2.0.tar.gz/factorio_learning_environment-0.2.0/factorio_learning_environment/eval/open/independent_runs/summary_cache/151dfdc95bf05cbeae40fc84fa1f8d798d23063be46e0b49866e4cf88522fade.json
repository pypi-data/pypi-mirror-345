{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring items properly.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters and Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters and mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel. Running out of fuel will halt operations and reduce efficiency.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to transfer iron ore into the furnace. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, recheck the inserter setup and alignment.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel entities as needed. Running out of coal can lead to operational downtime."}
