{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with neighbours:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -48.5)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace result is full\", indicating a need for input materials and output space.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) actively working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from chests to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Output System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) with warnings of \"waiting for source items\" and \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked\", indicating issues with transferring items to the output chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) intended for collecting iron plates, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without a valid target\n- Ensure that there is a valid nearby entity capable of accepting the item before attempting to insert. This error occurred when trying to insert iron ore and coal into entities that couldn't accept them.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a non-existent or empty entity\n- Verify the presence of items in the target entity before attempting extraction. This error occurred multiple times when trying to extract iron plates from a wooden chest that either didn't exist or was empty.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Check that the source entities have the necessary items available for the inserters to function. This issue was noted with inserters waiting for items from chests or furnaces.\n\n### Errors when inserters are blocked at the drop position\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter's output is clear and can accept items. This was a problem when the inserter's drop position was blocked, preventing item transfer.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources in inventory\n- Maintain adequate resources in the inventory to avoid errors when attempting to insert items into entities. This occurred when trying to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory."}
