Always ensure the target entity is an inserter (or an entity accepting items) rather than a steam engine.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Distance Error (Step 212)\n\u00a0 \u2013 The wooden chest placement failed because the target position (3.5, 15.5) was too far from the player\u2019s position (0, 0). Move closer to the target location before attempting to place the entity.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage Error (Step 213)\n\u00a0 \u2013 Failed placement of the wooden chest occurred due to its absence in the inventory. Verify that the required entity is available in inventory before placement.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Error (Step 212)\n\u00a0 \u2013 A NameError occurred because of an undefined variable ('target_chest'). Double-check variable names and ensure that references match the defined variables."}
