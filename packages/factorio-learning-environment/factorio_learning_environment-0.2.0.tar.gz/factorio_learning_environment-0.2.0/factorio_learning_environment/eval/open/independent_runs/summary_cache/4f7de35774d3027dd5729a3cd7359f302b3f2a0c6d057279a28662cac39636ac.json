{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transportation System at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a transport belt system consisting of belts at positions (-25.5, -65.5), (-24.5, -65.5), and (-23.5, -65.5) for copper ore extraction and transportation.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore extraction and storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) and a Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for iron plate production.\n\n### Transport Belt Systems\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-26.5, -65.5) to (-22.5, -65.5) for transporting materials.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-23.5, -64.5) to (-21.5, -64.5) for transporting materials.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-20.5, -64.5) to (-20.5, -66.5) for transporting materials.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5) for transporting materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. This can be done by checking the tile status or visually confirming the absence of other objects.\n\n### Errors when finding suitable positions for placing entities\n- Verify that the desired position for placing an entity is valid and unoccupied. Consider adjusting the position slightly if the initial placement attempt fails due to obstructions."}
