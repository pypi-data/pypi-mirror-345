For example, you need at least 5 stones to craft a Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient resources in the furnace\n- Monitor the fuel levels in the furnace to avoid running out of coal, which can halt production. Harvest more coal proactively when levels are low.\n\n### Errors related to recipe retrieval\n- Ensure that the prototypes you are trying to craft have valid recipes. If you encounter an error stating that a recipe could not be found, check if the prototype is available in the game or if you have the necessary technology unlocked.\n\n### Errors related to incorrect entity references\n- When using functions that require an entity, ensure you are passing the correct entity reference instead of a position. For example, use the actual furnace entity rather than its position when inserting items.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace or crafting machine. If you encounter an error stating \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory,\" check your inventory levels before proceeding.\n\n### Errors related to repeated attempts to insert without sufficient items\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to insert items into furnaces or machines when your inventory does not contain the required items. Check your inventory before each insertion attempt to prevent unnecessary errors."}
