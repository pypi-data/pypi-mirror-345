The agent repeatedly attempted to craft and place a Lab intended for supplying Automation Science Packs at position (0.5, 2.5), but these efforts failed due to missing inventory items and insufficient sub-ingredients. Although pre\u2010existing smelting facilities (a furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used for iron smelting and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) used for copper plate production) were referenced during production processes, no new production or research structures were constructed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Consistency\n  - Call functions with the correct signature. The get_entities() function was first invoked with an unsupported keyword argument ('radius') and later with an incorrect number of positional arguments. Verify parameter requirements before usage.\n\n\u2022 Handling Undefined or None Returns\n  - When retrieving entities (for example, attempting to list Labs), ensure the result is not None before iterating. Fallback to an empty collection to prevent errors from iterating over None.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Failures\n  - Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) are available prior to initiating Lab crafting. \n  - Confirm that the Lab is present in the inventory before attempting to place it, to avoid placement errors indicating \u201cNo lab in inventory.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Resource and Dependency Management\n  - Monitor and secure sufficient raw materials and processed components (like iron plates and copper plates) so that intermediate products can be crafted reliably. \n  - Verify that the necessary smelting and crafting processes are in place to support the production of complex items such as the Lab.\n\n"}
