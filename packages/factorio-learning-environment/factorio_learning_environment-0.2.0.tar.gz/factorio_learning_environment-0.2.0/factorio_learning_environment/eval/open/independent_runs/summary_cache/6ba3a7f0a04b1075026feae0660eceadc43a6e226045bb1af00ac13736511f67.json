{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection System at Position (x=41, y=-83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) moving coal from the drill to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for temporary coal storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) storing coal, currently holding 283 units.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing coal, currently holding 220 units.\n- BeltGroup connecting wooden chests, facilitating coal movement between positions (x=42.5, y=-83.5) and (x=45.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\", currently holding 64 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\", currently holding 76 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., mining drill or chest) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Make sure to supply the furnaces with the necessary raw materials for smelting. Check the input inventory of the furnace and ensure it has the required ingredients.\n\n### Errors with Stale Entity Data\n- Ensure that the game state is updated before attempting to access entity data. This can be achieved by refreshing the game state or ensuring that the entity data is not outdated before use."}
