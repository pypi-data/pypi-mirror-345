{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex\n1. Mining Area at (-15, -50):\n- Burner mining drill (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- Wooden chest for storage (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Stone furnace (x=-14.0, y=-47.0)\n\n2. Smelting Area near Origin:\n- Stone furnace group:\n  - Furnace at (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Furnace at (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n  - Furnace at (x=4.0, y=4.0)\n  - Furnace at (x=6.0, y=4.0)\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production\nLocated around (x=24.5, y=4.5):\n- Assembling machine (x=24.5, y=4.5)\n- Input chest with iron plates (x=21.5, y=4.5)\n- Output chest with copper plates and science packs (x=27.5, y=4.5)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - One at (x=22.5, y=4.5) feeding input materials\n  - One at (x=26.5, y=4.5) collecting output\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Steam engine (x=-5.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler (x=-2.0, y=23.5)\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Connected pipe networks:\n  - Pipe group at (x=-6.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe group at (x=-3.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe group at (x=0.5, y=23.5 to x=6.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Research Area\nMultiple labs connected to electricity group 40801, currently researching automation\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check if target location is clear before placing entities\n- Remove existing entities at the target location before placing new ones\n- Ensure there is enough space around the target location for the entity's dimensions\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to use them (e.g., pipe-to-ground, coal)\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner-type entities\n\n### Connection Issues\n- Verify fluid connections are properly aligned before attempting to connect pipes\n- Ensure power poles are within connection range of each other\n- Check that machines requiring power are connected to the power network\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner-type entities\n- Ensure proper resource input for assembling machines\n- Verify fluid flow in pipe systems"}
