{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to mine and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which is fueled by coal and actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores the mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. However, it is currently misaligned and not functioning correctly.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) which is fueled and ready to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is not receiving iron ore due to the misalignment of the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- **Issue**: The inserter's pickup position is not correctly aligned with the chest, causing a failure in transferring iron ore.\n- **Solution**: Ensure that the inserter's pickup position matches the position of the chest. Adjust the inserter's position or the chest's position to align them properly.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- **Issue**: Inserters and mining drills occasionally run out of fuel, leading to interruptions in operations.\n- **Solution**: Regularly check fuel levels and refuel entities like inserters and mining drills to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Resource Insertion Errors\n- **Issue**: Attempted to insert coal into the mining drill when there was no coal available in the inventory.\n- **Solution**: Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel mining drills or other entities.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- **Issue**: The furnace is not receiving iron ore due to the misalignment of the inserter.\n- **Solution**: Correct the alignment of the inserter to ensure it can successfully transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace."}
