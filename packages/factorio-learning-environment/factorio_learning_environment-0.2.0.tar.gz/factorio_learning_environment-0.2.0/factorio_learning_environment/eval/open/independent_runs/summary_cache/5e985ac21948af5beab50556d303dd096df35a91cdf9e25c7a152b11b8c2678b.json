{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently has 10 units of iron ore and is out of fuel.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -49.5): Transfers items into the furnace. It is currently fueled with 10 units of coal and is waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -49.5): Positioned to store items transferred by the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" and \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when Inserter is Waiting for Source Items\n- Regularly check that the source items are available for inserters to function correctly. This will prevent the inserter from having a status of \"waiting for source items.\"\n\n### Errors when Furnace is Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the furnace to avoid it running out of fuel, which halts production. This will prevent the furnace from having a status of \"out of fuel.\""}
