{"content": "The error indicates that the boiler could not be placed at the specified position due to a conflict with the offshore pump. This is a common issue when trying to place entities too close to each other or in an invalid configuration. Here are some steps to resolve this:\n\n### Tips for Successful Placement:\n\n1. **Check for Obstructions:**\n   - Ensure there are no obstructions like trees, rocks, or other entities in the intended placement area.\n\n2. **Increase Spacing:**\n   - Increase the spacing between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure they are not overlapping.\n   ```python\n   boiler = place_entity_next_to(\n       Prototype.Boiler, reference_position=offshore_pump.position, direction=Direction.DOWN, spacing=1\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Adjust Reference Position:**\n   - If increasing spacing does not work, try adjusting the reference position slightly to ensure the boiler has enough room.\n   ```python\n   boiler_position = offshore_pump.position.down(2)\n   boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Placement Area:**\n   - Use `inspect_area()` to check the surroundings of the intended placement to ensure there is enough space.\n   ```python\n   area_status = inspect_area(boiler_position)\n   print(f\"Area status around boiler position: {area_status}\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Manual Adjustment:**\n   - Manually adjust the position by moving the character slightly and retrying the placement.\n\n### Example Code for Adjusted Placement:\n\n```python\n# Attempt to place the boiler with increased spacing\ntry:\n    boiler = place_entity_next_to(\n        Prototype.Boiler, reference_position=offshore_pump.position, direction=Direction.DOWN, spacing=1\n    )\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to place boiler with spacing 1: {e}\")\n    # Try a different approach by manually specifying a position\n    boiler_position = offshore_pump.position.down(2)\n    boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully place the boiler and continue with your setup. Adjusting spacing and position is often necessary in Factorio to accommodate the game's grid-based placement system.", "summary_range": "[1-130]"}
