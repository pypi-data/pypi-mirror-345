If the source is empty, replenish it before using the inserter.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent entities\n- Confirm the presence of a valid entity containing the items you wish to extract before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when inserters are blocked or waiting for space\n- Regularly check and clear blockages in belts or chests to ensure smooth operation of inserters and prevent them from waiting unnecessarily."}
