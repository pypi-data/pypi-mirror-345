{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with an inventory containing 100 copper plates and a fuel source of 3 coal. The furnace is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients and its result inventory is full.\n\n### Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients**: \n  - Ensure that the required ingredients for crafting are available in the inventory or accessible from connected entities like furnaces or chests. In this case, the copper plates needed for crafting the automation science pack are not available for crafting as the furnace is not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n  \n- **Errors when transferring items to a chest that is full**: \n  - Check the inventory of the chest before transferring items to ensure there is enough space to accommodate the items being transferred. The current chest has 116 copper plates, which may limit further transfers.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**: \n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: \n  - Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined**:\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed due to missing required sub-ingredients (copper plates) which cannot be crafted without a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary containing items like 'stone-furnace', 'wood', 'iron-plate', 'automation-science-pack' (type: dict).\n  - `furnace`: Object representing the stone furnace (type: Furnace).\n  - `chest`: Object representing the wooden chest (type: Chest)."}
