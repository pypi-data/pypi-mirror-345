{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for copper smelting\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for additional copper smelting\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for iron smelting\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (x=-2.5, y=0.5), (x=-2.5, y=1.5), (x=-2.5, y=2.5), (x=-3.5, y=2.5), etc., connecting various entities to the power grid\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe connections supplying water to various entities\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Fluid Entities\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between fluid entities such as offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines are correctly aligned and connected. Verify that the connection points are not obstructed and that the entities are within the correct proximity to establish a connection.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to source items and that the source items are available. Check that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly configured and accessible.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check that the supply of raw materials such as iron ore and copper ore is maintained to avoid production halts."}
