{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) and another Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between the chests.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for input materials.\n\n### Copper Ore Collection and Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests positioned at (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), (0.5, -3.5), (5.5, -3.5), (0.5, -2.5), (5.5, -2.5), (0.5, 3.5), (5.5, 3.5), (0.5, 2.5), (5.5, 2.5), (0.5, 4.5), (5.5, 4.5) storing copper ore.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for input materials.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) and a Transport Belt at position (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Coal Mining Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5), with the chest at (52.5, -84.5) being full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using non-callable objects\n- Ensure that you are calling methods correctly. The error \"TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable\" suggests that you are trying to call an object that is not a function. Double-check your method calls and ensure that you are not trying to invoke objects as if they were functions.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory or storage\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests and other storage entities to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. For example, the chest at position (52.5, -84.5) is full, preventing the Burner Mining Drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces, are adequately supplied with fuel to maintain continuous operation. The Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) is out of fuel, which can disrupt resource extraction.\n\n### Errors due to lack of input materials\n- Ensure that production entities like Furnaces have the necessary input materials to function. The Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) are not operating due to a lack of ingredients to smelt."}
