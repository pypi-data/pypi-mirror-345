{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5) for storage\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), (0.5, -3.5), (0.5, -2.5), (5.5, -3.5), and (5.5, -2.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) for storage\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable\n- Ensure that you are using the correct method to interact with entities. The `pickup_entity` function should be used with an appropriate entity type and position. Verify the entity type and ensure it is not mistakenly being treated as a callable object.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full. Full chests can halt production processes. Consider using inserters to automate the transfer of items from chests to other entities or storage solutions.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Shortages\n- Ensure that all burner entities, such as mining drills and inserters, are adequately fueled. Regularly monitor fuel levels and replenish them as needed to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and other processing entities have the necessary ingredients to operate. Regularly supply these entities with the required raw materials to avoid production stoppages."}
