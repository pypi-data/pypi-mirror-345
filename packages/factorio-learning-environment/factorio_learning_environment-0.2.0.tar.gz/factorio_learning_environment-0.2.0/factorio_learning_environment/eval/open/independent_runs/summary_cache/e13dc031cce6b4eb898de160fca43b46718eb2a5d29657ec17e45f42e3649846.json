{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at position (41.0, -82.0)\nComplex structure consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal (currently contains 475 coal)\n- First burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) configured to pick from position (42.5, -81.5) and drop at (42.5, -79.5)\n- Second burner inserter at (43.5, -80.5) configured to pick from position (42.5, -80.5) and drop at (44.5, -80.5)\n- Transport belt group starting at (42.5, -81.5) extending to (43.5, -81.5)\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n\nThe structure is set up as an automated coal mining and transport system, with the drill mining coal into a chest, inserters moving coal along transport belts, and ultimately feeding into a furnace.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Verify target location is clear before placing entities - multiple attempts failed due to existing objects blocking placement\n- When placing inserters, ensure proper spacing between connected entities to allow for valid pickup/drop positions\n\n### Entity Configuration Issues\n- Pay attention to inserter rotation and pickup/drop positions to create proper material flow\n- Ensure inserters are properly aligned with their source and destination entities\n- Check that transport belts are oriented correctly to move materials in the intended direction\n\n### Code/API Issues\n- BeltGroup objects don't have a 'direction' attribute - use individual belt properties instead\n- When working with belt groups, access individual belt properties through the belts array\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\nNo utility functions defined in the provided logs\n\n### Important Variables\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter - Inserter moving items from chest to belt\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter - Inserter moving items from belt to furnace\n- belt: BeltGroup - Group of transport belts connecting components\n\n### Entity States\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Entity is functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Entity is waiting for input materials\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Output is blocked\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Entity lacks required input materials\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: Entity contains no items\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Entity is in normal state"}
