{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) with fuel (coal) and iron ore being processed into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) with fuel (coal) and iron ore being processed into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.0, 1.0) for automated insertion of iron ore into the furnace.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting various positions, including:\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) moving left.\n  - Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5) moving up.\n  - Belt from (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) moving up.\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) moving up.\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5) moving left.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. For example, when placing a burner-inserter at position (x=5.0, y=1.5), the placement failed due to an existing wooden chest. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid such conflicts.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
