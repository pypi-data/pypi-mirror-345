{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the processed iron plates.\nUpdates:\n- Steps 38\u201347: Produced and extracted multiple batches of iron plates; experienced a temporary halt due to insufficient iron ore.\n- Steps 48\u201349: Inserted additional iron ore resulting in an inventory update showing 14 iron ore remaining, 5 iron plates processed, and 25 coal used as fuel.\n- Step 51: Insertion of 10 additional iron ore updated the furnace inventory to 7 iron ore and 15 iron plates after processing.\n- Step 52: Extracted 10 iron plates, updating the furnace inventory to 13 iron plates.\n- Steps 54\u201355: Harvested 10 iron ore and inserted into the furnace; subsequent processing attempts resulted in consecutive timeouts with the furnace inventory eventually showing 22 iron plates and repeated timeout errors.\n- Step 56: Extracted 22 iron plates from the furnace, further updating connected inventories.\n- Step 58: Harvested 10 iron ore from a resource at position (-15.5, -50.5), adding to player inventory.\n- Step 59: Moved to the furnace, inserted 5 coal as fuel and 10 iron ore for smelting; processing produced 10 iron plates which were then extracted.\n- Steps 62: Repeated insertion of 5 coal and 10 iron ore into the furnace with monitored production cycles achieving a smooth build-up from 0 to 10 iron plates before extracting 10 plates, updating the player inventory to include 27 iron plates, 13 coal, and 40 iron-gear-wheel.\n- (No new structural placements or connections beyond the established Stone Furnace setup.)\n  \nNote: The recipe printout in step 63 for AssemblingMachine1 is informational and does not reflect the creation or connection of a new structure.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Timeout and Waiting Cycle Management in Smelting\n- Ensure consistent fuel and ingredient availability before initiating smelting cycles.\n- Monitor processing progress vigilantly, adjusting wait intervals promptly in case of production stalls.\n\n### Insufficient Resource Verification\n- Always verify resource quantities prior to insertion actions to avoid intermittent halts in processing.\n\n### Stale Entity Data Utilization\n- Regularly refresh entity data to incorporate current map states, especially following inventory updates, to prevent decision-making based on outdated information.\n\n### Consistent Error Patterns in Processing Activities\n- Group and analyze repeated timeout errors and processing delays to streamline corrective checks and confirmation of entity status before subsequent operations."}
