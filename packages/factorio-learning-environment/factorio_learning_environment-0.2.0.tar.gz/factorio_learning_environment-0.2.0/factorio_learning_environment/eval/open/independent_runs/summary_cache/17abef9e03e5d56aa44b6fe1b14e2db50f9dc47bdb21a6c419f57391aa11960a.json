For example, iron plates must be smelted in a furnace before they can be used for crafting burner inserters.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target position is free of other entities before placing a new entity. Adjust the position or remove the obstructing entity if necessary.\n\n### Errors in Inserting Items with Insufficient Inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### NameError Due to Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are properly defined and initialized before use. Double-check variable names for typos or incorrect references.\n\n### Errors in Placing Chests\n- Ensure the intended position for placing a chest is not occupied by another object. Adjust the position if necessary."}
