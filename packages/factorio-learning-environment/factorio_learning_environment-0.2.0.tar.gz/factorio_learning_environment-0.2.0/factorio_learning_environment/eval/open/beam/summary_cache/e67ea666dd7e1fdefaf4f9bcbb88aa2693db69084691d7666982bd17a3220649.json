Let's proceed with setting up the power generation system to ensure the assembling machine is powered.\n\n### Steps to Set Up Power Generation:\n\n1. **Place an Offshore Pump:**\n   - This will provide water to the boilers.\n   - Ensure it's placed on water.\n\n2. **Place a Boiler:**\n   - Connect it to the offshore pump to heat the water.\n   - Ensure it has a fuel source like coal.\n\n3. **Place a Steam Engine:**\n   - Connect it to the boiler to generate electricity.\n\n4. **Connect the Steam Engine to the Electric Network:**\n   - Use small electric poles to connect the steam engine to the assembling machine.\n\n### Code Example:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Place the Offshore Pump\ntry:\n    water_position = find_water_nearby()  # Hypothetical function to find water\n    offshore_pump = place_entity(Prototype.OffshorePump, water_position)\n    print(\"Offshore pump placed successfully.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error placing offshore pump: {e}\")\n\n# Step 2: Place the Boiler\ntry:\n    boiler_position = Position(water_position.x + 1, water_position.y)\n    boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, boiler_position)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, 5)  # Insert some coal to start\n    print(\"Boiler placed and fueled.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error placing boiler: {e}\")\n\n# Step 3: Place the Steam Engine\ntry:\n    steam_engine_position = Position(boiler_position.x + 1, boiler_position.y)\n    steam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, steam_engine_position)\n    print(\"Steam engine placed successfully.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error placing steam engine: {e}\")\n\n# Step 4: Connect to the Electric Network\ntry:\n    pole_position = Position(steam_engine_position.x + 1, steam_engine_position.y)\n    electric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, pole_position)\n    connect_entities(electric_pole, assembling_machine)\n    print(\"Assembling machine connected to power network.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error connecting to power network: {e}\")\n\n# Verify the final setup\nfinal_entities_status = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Final Setup Status: {final_entities_status}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- Ensure all components are within reach of each other for connections.\n- Verify that the boiler is fueled and the steam engine is connected to the boiler.\n- Use the `inspect_inventory()` function to check for available resources before crafting or placing entities.\n- Adjust positions based on the actual layout of your environment.", "summary_range": "[1-128]"}
