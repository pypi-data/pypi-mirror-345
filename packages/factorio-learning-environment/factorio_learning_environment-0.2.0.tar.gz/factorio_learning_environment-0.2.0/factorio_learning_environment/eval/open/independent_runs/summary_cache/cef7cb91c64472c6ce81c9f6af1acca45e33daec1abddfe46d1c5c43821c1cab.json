{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the burner mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing an entity is unoccupied. If a collision occurs, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and functionality\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Regularly check and adjust inserter setups to ensure they are functioning as intended.\n\n### Errors when entities are not receiving resources\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly transferring resources to the intended entity. If a furnace is not receiving ore, check the inserter setup and ensure it is aligned and fueled properly."}
