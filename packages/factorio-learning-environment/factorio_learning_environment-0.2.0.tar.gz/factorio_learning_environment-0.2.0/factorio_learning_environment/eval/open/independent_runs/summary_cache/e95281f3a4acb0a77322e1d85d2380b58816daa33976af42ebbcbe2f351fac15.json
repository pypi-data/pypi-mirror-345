Ensure that the targeted fluid_system identifier is current, correctly assigned, and that the pipe group is within an appropriate proximity before attempting a connection.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Attribute Usage:\n  - Use only supported inventory attributes when accessing or modifying inventory items to avoid attribute-related errors.\n\n\u2022 Consistency in Connection Parameters:\n  - Verify that fluid_system identifiers and connection parameters align with the existing map configuration to prevent mismatches during pipe group lookups."}
