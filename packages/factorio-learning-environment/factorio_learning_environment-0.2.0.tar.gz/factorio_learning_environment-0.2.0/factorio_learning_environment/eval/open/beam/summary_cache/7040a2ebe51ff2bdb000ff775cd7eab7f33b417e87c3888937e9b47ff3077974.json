Here are the updated details:\n\n### Current Furnace Status:\n1. **First Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 11 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 21 (total available for processing)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 33 (total)\n   - Status: WORKING (actively producing)\n\n2. **Second Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 13 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 0 (none remaining)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 16 (total)\n   - Status: NO INGREDIENTS (idle)\n\n### Summary:\n- The first furnace now has 21 iron ore and continues to work, increasing our iron plate production.\n- The second furnace remains idle due to a lack of raw materials.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. To maximize production, we should consider inserting iron ore into the second furnace as well. \n2. We can also assess our inventory to determine if we need to craft additional entities or gather more resources.\n\nLet's insert some iron ore into the second furnace to get it operational again!\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1.
