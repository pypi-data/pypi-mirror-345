For example, verify that a copper furnace is available and can accept copper plates.\n\n### Errors when moving to positions with incorrect data types\n- Ensure that position data is correctly formatted and uses integer indices. Avoid using strings or other non-integer types for position coordinates.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients for smelting.\n\n### Errors related to power connectivity\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters and poles, are properly connected to the power network to avoid disruptions in operation."}
