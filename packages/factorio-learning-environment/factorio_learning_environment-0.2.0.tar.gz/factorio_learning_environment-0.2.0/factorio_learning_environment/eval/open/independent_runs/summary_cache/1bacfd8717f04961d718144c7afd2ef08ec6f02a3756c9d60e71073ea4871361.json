{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, with pipes at various positions including (-45.5, -122.5) and (-38.5, -110.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with a source of iron ore and producing copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) and another at position (6.0, -62.0), both with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a Small Electric Pole at position (5.5, -60.5) and a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Storage Facilities\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron and copper plates\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple PipeGroups at various positions, all currently empty, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (-45.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-48.5, -121.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-46.5, -120.5)\n\n### Electrical Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, currently with no voltage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Verify that there are no obstructions and that the pipes are placed correctly to establish a fluid connection.\n\n### Boiler Not Operational\n- Check the connections and ensure that the boiler is properly connected to both the offshore pump and the steam engine. Verify that there is a continuous pipe connection and that there are no missing segments.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that the inserter is within range of a powered electric pole. Check the connections and confirm that the electric network is operational and providing power to the inserter.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner mining drills and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Refill them with appropriate fuel to prevent interruptions."}
