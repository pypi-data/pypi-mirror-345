{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and transfers it to the adjacent chests.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) which transfers items between the chests.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a non-existent or empty chest\n- Ensure the target chest contains the items you wish to extract before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid tiles\n- Verify the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity before attempting placement. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or reference position if placement fails.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors when repositioning inserters\n- Confirm that the new position for inserters is valid and that they are properly aligned to transfer items between the intended entities."}
