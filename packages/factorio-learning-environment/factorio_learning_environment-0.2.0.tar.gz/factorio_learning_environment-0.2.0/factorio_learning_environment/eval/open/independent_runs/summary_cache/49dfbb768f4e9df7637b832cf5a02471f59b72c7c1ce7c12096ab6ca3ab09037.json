{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position(8.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear input system:\n  - Wooden chest at position(7.5, 9.5)\n  - Burner inserter at position(7.5, 10.5)\n- Copper plate input system:\n  - Wooden chest at position(9.5, 9.5) containing 2 copper plates\n  - Burner inserter at position(9.5, 10.5)\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter at position(10.5, 13.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position(11.5, 13.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n- Small electric pole at position(8.5, 15.5) providing power\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-4.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 16.0) containing 31 coal\n- Offshore pump at position(-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected pipe systems for water and steam circulation\n- Electric pole network distributing power\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at various locations:\n- Setup 1 (around x=41):\n  - Burner mining drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\n  - Wooden chest at position(41.5, -80.5) containing 252 coal\n  - Burner inserter at position(41.5, -79.5)\n\n- Setup 2 (around x=-28):\n  - Burner mining drill at position(-28.0, -61.0)\n  - Wooden chest at position(-27.5, -59.5)\n  - Burner inserter at position(-26.5, -59.5)\n  - Stone furnace at position(-25.0, -59.0)\n  - Output chest at position(-22.5, -58.5) containing 2 iron plates\n\n- Setup 3 (around x=-18):\n  - Burner mining drill at position(-18.0, -53.0)\n  - Input chest at position(-17.5, -51.5)\n  - Stone furnace at position(-15.0, -51.0)\n  - Output chest at position(-12.5, -50.5) containing 44 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placement - multiple attempts to place inserters where electric poles or transport belts already exist\n- When placing entities next to assemblers, ensure proper spacing and direction to avoid collisions with existing structures\n- Consider the full dimensions of entities (especially larger ones like assemblers) when planning adjacent placements\n\n### Direction Related Errors\n- Invalid direction \"NORTHWEST\" used - only use valid Direction enums (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- Ensure proper orientation of inserters relative to their source and destination positions\n\n### Space Management\n- Ensure adequate spacing between production line components\n- Consider the complete path of materials when placing input/output inserters and chests\n- Plan for proper clearance around larger entities like assembling machines and furnaces\n\n### Entity Interaction Issues\n- Inserters need proper alignment with their pickup and drop positions\n- Ensure inserters can reach their intended source and destination points\n- Place appropriate destination entities for inserter outputs to prevent blocking"}
