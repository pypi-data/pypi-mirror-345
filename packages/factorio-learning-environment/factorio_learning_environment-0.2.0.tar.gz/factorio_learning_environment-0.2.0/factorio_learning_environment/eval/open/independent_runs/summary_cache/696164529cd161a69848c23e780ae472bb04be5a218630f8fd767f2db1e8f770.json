{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Three stone furnaces at positions:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Each furnace is fueled with coal and processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions:\n  - Chest at position (-14.5, -50.5)\n  - Chest at position (-13.5, -50.5)\n  - Chest at position (-12.5, -50.5)\n  - Chest at position (-11.5, -50.5)\n  - Chest at position (-10.5, -50.5)\n  - Chest at position (-9.5, -50.5)\n  - Chest at position (-8.5, -50.5)\n  - Chest at position (-7.5, -50.5)\n  - Chest at position (-6.5, -50.5)\n- These chests are used for storing processed iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) receiving extracted iron ore.\n- Additional wooden chests at positions:\n  - Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (7.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (6.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (9.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (8.5, -60.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing resources have enough space to accommodate incoming items. Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full. Ensure that the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is emptied to allow continuous mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int (205)\n  - `iron-ore`: int (142)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (4748)\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int (4)\n  - `wood`: int (10)\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the current structures and potential errors in the agent's operations."}
