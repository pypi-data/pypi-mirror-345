{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Steam Power Plant System\nLocated in the southern area of the map, consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) producing water\n- Boiler at (-2.0, 23.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at (-5.5, 12.5)\n- Complex pipe network connecting these components:\n  - Water input pipes from pump at y=19.5-21.5\n  - Steam output pipes at y=14.5 connecting to steam engine\n  - Multiple pipe groups for water and steam transport\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex\nLocated in northern area (around y=-50), consists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore (392 units)\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) smelting iron plates\n\n### Smelting Array\nMultiple stone furnaces for smelting:\n- Furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnaces at (4.0, 4.0), (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have coal fuel but currently lack ingredients\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production\nLocated around (24.5, 4.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine at (24.5, 4.5)\n- Input chest at (21.5, 4.5) containing iron plates (770)\n- Output chest at (27.5, 4.5) containing copper plates (430) and science packs (16)\n- Two burner inserters at (22.5, 4.5) and (26.5, 4.5) for automation\n\n### Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs spread across the map, connected by electricity network (currently unpowered)\n- Several labs containing automation science packs\n- Electric pole network connecting labs (id=95872)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing pipes or other entities, check if the target location is already occupied\n- Use the entity preview to verify placement is possible before attempting to place\n\n### Distance Related Placement Errors\n- Stay within 10 tiles of target location when placing entities\n- Move closer to target location if \"too far away\" error occurs\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Labs and assembling machines are not receiving power\n- Ensure power generation (steam engine) is properly connected to the power network\n- Verify all components in power network are properly linked with electric poles\n\n### Fluid System Connection Issues\n- Steam engine shows \"no input liquid\" warning\n- Ensure complete pipe connections between offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Verify pipe systems are properly connected at junction points\n\n### Resource Supply Issues\n- Burner inserters running out of fuel\n- Mining drill lacking fuel\n- Keep fuel supplied to all burner-type entities"}
