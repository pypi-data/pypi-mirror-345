{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED due to no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status FULL_OUTPUT, containing 200 units of water at 15\u00b0C and 200 units of steam at 165\u00b0C.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING, supplying water to the system.\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions, including (x=1.5, y=20.5) and (x=5.5, y=20.5), with fluid system 30410.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=21.5) with fluid system 30418.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with fluid system 30420, transporting water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=7.5, y=8.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), and others, with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when reconnecting pipes\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes. Verify that the path is clear and the correct entities are being connected.\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Verify that there is a suitable position available for placing small electric poles. Ensure there are no obstructions and that the placement area is valid.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wooden-chest: int = 11`\n  - `burner-inserter: int = 5`\n  - `small-electric-pole: int = 2`\n  - `pipe: int = 195`\n  - `pipe-to-ground: int = 2`\n  - `boiler: int = 1`\n  - `burner-mining-drill: int = 3`\n  - `offshore-pump: int = 2`\n  - `stone-furnace: int = 4`\n  - `lab: int = 1`\n  - `wood: int = 3`\n  - `coal: int = 170`\n  - `stone: int = 20`\n  - `iron-ore: int = 169`\n  - `copper-ore: int = 42`\n  - `iron-plate: int = 2011`\n  - `copper-cable: int = 8`\n  - `electronic-circuit: int = 4`\n\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
