{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5), intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from picking up items. Double-check the pickup position coordinates against the chest's position.\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- When placing an inserter, ensure there is no collision with existing entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Inserter Fueling\n- Regularly refuel inserters with coal to maintain their operation. An inserter without fuel will not function.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to transfer items into the furnace. Check for any misalignment or obstruction that might prevent the transfer of iron ore to the furnace.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available in the inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to insert it into a mining drill."}
