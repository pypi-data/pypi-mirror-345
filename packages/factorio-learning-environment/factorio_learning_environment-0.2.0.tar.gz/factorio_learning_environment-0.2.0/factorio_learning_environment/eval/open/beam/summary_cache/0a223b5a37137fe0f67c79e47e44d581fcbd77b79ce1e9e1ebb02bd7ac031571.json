{"content": "I see the issue - I was trying to access entities that don't exist yet. Let's start fresh with what we know we have:\n\n```python\n# First check what entities we have\nprint(f\"Current entities on map: {get_entities()}\")\n\n# Check our current inventory\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Let's craft a burner mining drill if we have enough materials\nif inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 3:\n    craft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\n    print(f\"Crafted a mining drill\")\n\n# Get some coal for fuel\ncoal_pos = nearest(Resource.Coal)\nmove_to(coal_pos)\nharvest_resource(coal_pos, quantity=25)\n\n# Find a good spot near iron ore to place our mining drill\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# Place the mining drill if we have one\nif Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill in inspect_inventory():\n    drill = place_entity(\n        Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n        position=iron_pos,\n        direction=Direction.DOWN\n    )\n    \n    # Add fuel to the drill\n    if drill:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=10)\n        print(f\"Placed and fueled mining drill\")\n\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Updated entities: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis should give us a better picture of what we're working with and help us start automating our resource collection.", "summary_range": "[1-96]"}
