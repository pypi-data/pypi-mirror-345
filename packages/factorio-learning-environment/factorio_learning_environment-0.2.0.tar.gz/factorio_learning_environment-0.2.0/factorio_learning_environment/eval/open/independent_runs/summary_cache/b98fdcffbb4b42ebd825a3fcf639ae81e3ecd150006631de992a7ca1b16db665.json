{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (15.5,72.5) storing iron ore (currently contains 15 iron ore)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at (-46.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (-46.5,70.5) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-46.5,72.5) storing copper ore (currently contains 16 copper ore)\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,-0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,-0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-5.0,-0.5) converting water to steam (currently has coal fuel)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5,-0.5) generating electricity\n- Pipe network connecting the components (currently not fully functional)\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at (16.0,76.0)\n- Stone furnace at (16.0,76.0) (currently not operational due to lack of fuel and input materials)\n\n### New Power Generation Attempt at (-9.5,19.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,19.5)\n- Boiler at (0.0,30.5)\n- Steam engine at (5.5,30.5) (not connected)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power system connection issues\n- Ensure steam engines are properly connected to both the fluid system (steam pipes) and electrical network\n- Verify all pipe connections between offshore pump, boiler and steam engine are properly established\n- Check that power poles connect all electrical consumers to the steam engine\n\n### Entity placement collisions\n- When placing inserters or other entities near existing structures, ensure there is sufficient space\n- Consider increasing spacing parameter or changing direction when placement fails\n- Check for nearby entities that might block placement (mining drills, chests, etc.)\n\n### Fluid system troubleshooting\n- Verify fluid connections between all components in the chain (pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 engine)\n- Check that pipes are properly aligned and connected to the correct ports\n- Ensure there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network\n\n### Power verification\n- Always verify power status of electrical mining drills after connection\n- Check that steam engine shows WORKING status before assuming power is available\n- Monitor power production and consumption to ensure sufficient capacity\n\n### Water source placement\n- Verify water source exists before attempting to place offshore pump\n- Ensure offshore pump is placed directly adjacent to water\n- Check terrain type before placing boilers/engines to avoid water tiles\n\n### Component spacing\n- Maintain proper spacing between boiler and steam engine (2 tiles minimum)\n- Ensure all power plant components are placed on land, not water\n- Verify clear path for pipe connections between components"}
