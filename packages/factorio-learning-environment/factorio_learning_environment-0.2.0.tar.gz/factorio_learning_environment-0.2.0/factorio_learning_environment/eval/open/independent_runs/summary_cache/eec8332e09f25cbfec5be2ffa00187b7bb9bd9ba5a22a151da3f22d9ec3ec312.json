{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Steam Power Plant\nThis structure is designed for generating electricity. It currently consists of water pumping, two boiler-engine pairs, and water pipe connections. Steam connections between boilers and engines are not yet established.\n-   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water.\n-   **Boiler 1** at position (x=8.0, y=13.5): Heats water using fuel (currently has no fuel).\n-   **Steam Engine 1** at position (x=11.5, y=13.5): Intended to generate power from steam produced by Boiler 1.\n-   **Boiler 2** at position (x=15.0, y=13.5): Heats water using fuel (currently has no fuel).\n-   **Steam Engine 2** at position (x=18.5, y=13.5): Intended to generate power from steam produced by Boiler 2.\n-   **Pipe Network"}
