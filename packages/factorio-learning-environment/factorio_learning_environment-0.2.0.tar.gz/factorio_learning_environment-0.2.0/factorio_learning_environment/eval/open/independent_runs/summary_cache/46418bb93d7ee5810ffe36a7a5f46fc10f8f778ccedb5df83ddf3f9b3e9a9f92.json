{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with a fuel source of coal. The furnace is currently full of fuel but has no ingredients to smelt. It has produced iron plates in the past, as indicated by the inventory.\n\n### Pipe System at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\n- Comprises a group of pipes forming a fluid system. The pipes are positioned at:\n  - (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=23.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n- The system is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Consists of electric poles positioned at various coordinates, providing a framework for electricity distribution. The network is currently not energized.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Moving to New Areas\n- Ensure that the indices used for movement are integers, not strings. This will prevent errors related to incorrect data types during movement operations.\n\n### Errors when Placing Offshore Pumps\n- Verify the suitability of the position before attempting to place an offshore pump. Multiple attempts to place the pump in unsuitable positions were noted.\n\n### Errors when Placing Boilers and Steam Engines\n- Check the suitability of the position before placing boilers and steam engines. Several attempts to place these entities in unsuitable positions were recorded.\n\n### Connection Errors between Offshore Pumps and Boilers\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between offshore pumps and boilers to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors in Electric Pole Placement\n- Confirm that electric poles are placed correctly to avoid placement issues that prevent the connection of electric networks.\n\n### Boiler Placement Validation Errors\n- Ensure that the dimensions provided for boiler placement are valid integers to comply with the building requirements and avoid validation errors."}
