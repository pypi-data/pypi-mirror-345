{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-63\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation (Water -> Steam -> Electricity)\n*   **Purpose:** Generates electricity from water using coal as fuel.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Offshore Pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 (Extracts water, Status: WORKING)\n    *   Boiler at x=-5.0 y=2.5 (Heats water to steam using coal, Status: NOT_CONNECTED - No input liquid/fluid connections)\n    *   Steam Engine at x=0.5 y=6.5 (Generates electricity from steam, Status: NOT_CONNECTED - No input liquid/fluid connections, not connected to power network)\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler (fluid_system=16792/16793, status=EMPTY/FULL_OUTPUT - partially connected, water only at pump)\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Boiler to Steam Engine (fluid_system=16797, status=EMPTY)\n*   **Updates:** Boiler was refueled and briefly worked (Step 58) but became disconnected again (Step 62). Steam engine was connected to the power grid (Step 58) but is not receiving steam.\n\n### Coal Mine\n*   **Purpose:** Mines coal and stores it in a chest.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Electric Mining Drill at x=15.5 y=-0.5 (Status: NO_POWER)\n    *   Wooden Chest at x=15.5 y=1.5 (Receives coal from the drill)\n*   **Updates:** Drill was connected to the power grid (Step 58) but is currently unpowered.\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction and Processing\n*   **Purpose:** Extracts crude oil, refines it, and produces plastic.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   **Extraction:**\n        *   Pumpjack at x=17.5 y=40.5 (Status: NO_POWER)\n        *   Pumpjack at x=20.5 y=40.5 (Status: NO_POWER)\n        *   PipeGroup"}
