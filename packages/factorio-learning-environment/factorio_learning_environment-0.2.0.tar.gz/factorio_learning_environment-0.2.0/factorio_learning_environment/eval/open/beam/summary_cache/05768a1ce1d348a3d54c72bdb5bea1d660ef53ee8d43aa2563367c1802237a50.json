{"content": "I notice we're still having issues with the mining drill not accepting fuel. Let's try to specifically target the drill at position (-20.0, 22.0) and get right next to it before attempting to fuel it:\n\n```python\n# First get the specific drill we want\ndrills = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})\ntarget_drill = None\nfor drill in drills:\n    if drill.position.x == -20.0 and drill.position.y == 22.0:\n        target_drill = drill\n        break\n\nif target_drill:\n    print(f\"Found target drill at: {target_drill.position}\")\n    \n    # Move right next to the drill\n    move_to(Position(x=-20.0, y=21.0))  # Position just below the drill\n    print(\"Moved next to drill\")\n    \n    # Try to add fuel\n    if target_drill.status == EntityStatus.NO_FUEL:\n        # Check our coal inventory first\n        inventory = inspect_inventory()\n        print(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n        \n        if 'coal' in inventory:\n            # Try inserting coal\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, target_drill, quantity=5)\n            print(\"Attempted to add fuel to drill\")\n            \n            # Verify the drill's status\n            print(f\"Drill status after fueling: {target_drill.status}\")\n            print(f\"Drill fuel: {target_drill.fuel}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"No coal in inventory!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Could not find target drill!\")\n\n# Print final status\nprint(f\"Final drill status: {target_drill.status if target_drill else 'No drill found'}\")\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should help us:\n1. Specifically target the correct drill\n2. Get close enough to interact with it\n3. Verify we have coal before attempting to fuel\n4. Check the status after attempting to fuel\n\nLet's see if this helps us understand why the drill isn't accepting fuel.", "summary_range": "[1-2794]"}
