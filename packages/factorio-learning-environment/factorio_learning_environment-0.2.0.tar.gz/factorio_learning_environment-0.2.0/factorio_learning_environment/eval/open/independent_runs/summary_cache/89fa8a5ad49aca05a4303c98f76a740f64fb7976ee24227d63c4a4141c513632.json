{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbour: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -48.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -48.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Inventory: Iron Plate\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Transfers iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -47.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Transfers iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -47.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Stores iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning correctly.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. If the tile is occupied, consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be caused by a lack of resources or misalignment issues.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage."}
