It supports resource processing for advanced production requirements.\n\n### Copper Plate Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of a furnace used to process copper ore into copper plates. This structure is essential for resolving copper plate shortages needed for subsequent production steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval:\n  - Avoid adding unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) when calling get_entities.\n  - Do not supply unexpected positional arguments; always follow the correct function signature.\n\n\u2022 Iteration over None:\n  - Ensure the result of entity-retrieval functions is validated as iterable before processing it.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting and placement failures:\n  - Verify that a lab item is actually available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  - Confirm that all necessary sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable) are in sufficient quantity prior to lab crafting.\n  - Establish a stable production pathway for intermediate materials to prevent recurring resource shortages."}
