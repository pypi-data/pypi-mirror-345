{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (56.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 56.0, -62.0)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) for mining coal\n- Inserter (position 42.5, -81.5) that moves coal from the Burner Mining Drill to the Wooden Chest\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 40.5, -83.5) that collects coal from the Burner Mining Drill\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 43.5, -81.5) that unblocks the inserter at position (42.5, -81.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to crafting items\n- Ensure you have all required materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, the Wooden Chest requires 2 wood, which could not be crafted due to missing materials.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For instance, a Wooden Chest could not be placed at (43.5, -81.5) because it was not available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when using crafting machines\n- Make sure to insert the necessary items into the crafting machine before attempting to craft. The Stone Furnace requires iron ore to smelt into iron plates, which must be inserted before crafting can occur.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Move to the target entity from which you want to extract items before attempting to extract. For example, ensure you are positioned correctly when extracting from the Wooden Chest.\n\n### Errors related to fuel\n- Ensure that the Burner Mining Drill has sufficient fuel before attempting to operate it. The drill was reported as \"out of fuel\" when trying to extract coal.\n\n### Errors with inserters\n- Ensure that the inserter has items available to pick up and that there is space in the destination before attempting to insert items. The inserter was reported as \"waiting for source items\" and \"waiting for space in destination\" when it could not operate.\n- The inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) is waiting for space in destination as the output is full. Place a sink object at (43.5, -81.5) to unblock.\n\n### Errors with inventory management\n- The agent repeatedly extracted coal from the Wooden Chest without ensuring enough space in the inventory, leading to inefficient operations. Always check inventory space before extracting items."}
