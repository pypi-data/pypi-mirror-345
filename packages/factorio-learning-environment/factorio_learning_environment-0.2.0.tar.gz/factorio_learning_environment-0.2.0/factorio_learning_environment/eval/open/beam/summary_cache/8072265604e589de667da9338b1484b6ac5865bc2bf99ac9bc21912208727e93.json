{"content": "I notice a pattern here - the furnace appears empty when we inspect it (`furnace_contents: {}`), but it's actually full when we try to insert items. This suggests there might be a disconnect between what we can see in the inventory and what's actually in the furnace.\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n```python\n# Get our references\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\nprint(f\"Found drill at {drill.position} and furnace at {furnace.position}\")\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {furnace.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace warnings: {furnace.warnings}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace fuel: {furnace.fuel}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace source: {furnace.furnace_source}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace result: {furnace.furnace_result}\")\n\n# Let's try to extract anything that might be in the furnace\nmove_to(furnace.position)\n\n# Try to extract items even if inventory shows empty\ntry:\n    extract_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace.position, quantity=50)  # Try to extract all coal\n    print(\"Extracted coal from furnace\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Could not extract coal: {e}\")\n\ntry:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, quantity=10)  # Try to extract any plates\n    print(\"Extracted iron plates from furnace\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Could not extract iron plates: {e}\")\n\ntry:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace.position, quantity=10)  # Try to extract any ore\n    print(\"Extracted iron ore from furnace\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Could not extract iron ore: {e}\")\n\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status after extraction attempts: {furnace.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace fuel after extraction: {furnace.fuel}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace source after extraction: {furnace.furnace_source}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace result after extraction: {furnace.furnace_result}\")\n\n```\n\nThis code will:\n1. Get detailed information about the furnace's state\n2. Try to extract items even if the inventory appears empty\n3. Print detailed status information after our extraction attempts\n\nThis should help us understand what's actually in the furnace and why we can't insert new items.", "summary_range": "[1-3568]"}
