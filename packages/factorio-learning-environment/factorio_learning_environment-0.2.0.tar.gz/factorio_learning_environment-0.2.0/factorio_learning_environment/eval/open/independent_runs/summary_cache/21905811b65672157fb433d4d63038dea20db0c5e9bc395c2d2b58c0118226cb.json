Regularly check and adjust the inserter's position if the transfer is not occurring as expected.\n- Keep inserters fueled to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and refuel as necessary to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inserter setup and alignment to ensure materials are being delivered to the furnace.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory.
