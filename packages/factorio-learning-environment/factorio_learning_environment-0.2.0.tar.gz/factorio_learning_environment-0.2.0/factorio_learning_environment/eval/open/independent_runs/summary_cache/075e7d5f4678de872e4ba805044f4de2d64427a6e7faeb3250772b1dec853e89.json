{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Processing System at (-28, -61) area\nTwo parallel automated mining and smelting lines (unchanged from previous report)\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing System at (-18, -49) area\nTwo mining lines with updated collection system (unchanged from previous report)\n\n### Power Generation System (In Progress) at (-66.5, -97.5)\nCurrent setup of steam-based power generation:\n- Offshore pump at (-66.5, -97.5) - Not connected\n- Boiler at (-61.5, -93.0) - Not connected\n- Multiple disconnected pipe groups at various positions, indicating incomplete water system\n\n### Research Setup\n- Lab placed at (-3.5, -46.5), currently without power (unchanged)\n\n### Additional Processing\nTwo stone furnaces at (0,0) and (2,0) for iron plate production (unchanged)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Connection Errors\n- Ensure connection points between entities are not blocked before attempting to connect\n- Plan pipe layouts to avoid crossing or blocking connection points\n- Remove all existing pipe connections before attempting to create new ones to avoid conflicts\n\n### Resource Management\n- Verify sufficient materials in inventory before attempting construction\n- Ensure iron plates are available (through smelting) before attempting to craft items that require them\n- Monitor inventory levels of critical crafting materials\n\n### Fluid System Setup\n- Create direct, minimal connections between fluid entities rather than complex networks\n- Remove all disconnected pipes before attempting new connections to avoid interference\n- Ensure proper spacing around fluid entities to allow for connection points\n\n### Production Chain Issues\n- Ensure all components of a production chain are properly fueled and connected\n- Monitor resource production and consumption rates to maintain steady flow\n- Keep production chains supplied with required raw materials\n\n### System Design\n- Leave adequate space between parallel production lines\n- Consider fluid and power distribution paths when planning layout\n- Ensure proper spacing for inserter pickup and drop positions\n- Plan for future expansion when placing initial structures\n\n### Crafting Requirements\n- Remember that iron plates cannot be hand-crafted and require a furnace\n- Plan crafting sequences considering both direct materials and intermediate products\n- Maintain sufficient stock of basic materials needed for crafting"}
