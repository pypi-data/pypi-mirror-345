{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (10 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Produces: Iron Plates (20 units currently in furnace)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Produces: Iron Plates (19 units currently in furnace)\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Drop Position: (40.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5)\n  - Inventory: Coal (30 units)\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup at position (0.5, -0.5)\n  - Inputs: Belt from (0.5, 0.5) to (0.5, -1.5)\n  - Status: Empty\n- BeltGroup at position (3.5, -0.5)\n  - Inputs: Belt from (3.5, 0.5) to (3.5, -1.5)\n  - Status: Empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items Without Required Ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting a burner mining drill requires iron plates, which must be smelted from iron ore using a furnace.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities Without Required Items in Inventory\n- Verify that the necessary items are present in the inventory before attempting to place an entity. For instance, attempting to place a wooden chest without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Raw Resource Items\n- Remember that certain items, like stone, are raw resources and cannot be crafted. They must be gathered directly from the environment. Ensure raw resources are collected before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. If an object is already present, reposition the entity or clear the space.\n\n### Errors in Inserting Items Without Inventory Stock\n- Confirm that the items you wish to insert are available in your inventory. For instance, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace when none is available will result in an error.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities Without Required Items in Inventory\n- Ensure that the items you wish to place, such as a burner inserter, are available in your inventory before attempting to place them."}
