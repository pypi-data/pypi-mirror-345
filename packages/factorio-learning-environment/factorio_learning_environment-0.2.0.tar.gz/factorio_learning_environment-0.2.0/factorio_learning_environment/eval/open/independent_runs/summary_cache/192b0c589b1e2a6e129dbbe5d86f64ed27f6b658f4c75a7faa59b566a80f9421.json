{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Updated)\n- **Pumpjack** at position (17.5, 40.5) - Powered and extracting crude oil (connected to power pole at 15.5,40.5)\n- **Oil Refinery** at position (24.5, 44.5) - Still unpowered despite connection attempts (needs direct power pole connection)\n- **Chemical Plant** at position (31.5, 46.5) - Unpowered and missing coal input for plastic production\n- Pipe networks:\n  - Crude oil pipes from pumpjack to refinery (system 12450, status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n  - Petroleum gas pipes from refinery to chemical plant (system 12453, status: EMPTY)\n\n### Coal Mining Operation\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at position (34.5, 20.5) - Still unpowered with coal output on belts\n- Transport belts now contain 23 coal units moving towards chemical plant\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Working with water output\n- **Boiler** at (-7.0, -0.5) - Now fueled with 14 coal, producing steam\n- **Steam Engine** at (-2.5, -0.5) - Generating power (connected to pole at -2.5,1.5)\n- Power network (voltage: 891000) covers pumpjack but not refinery/chemical plant\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Power Connection Issues\n- Oil refinery remains unpowered despite multiple connection attempts - needs direct pole placement within 7.5 tiles\n- Chemical plant also unpowered - ensure all production buildings have direct power pole connections\n- Verify power network coverage with `get_electricity_network()` before assuming connection\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Repeated inserter placement failures at (30.5, 45.5) and (30.5, 46.5) - these positions are occupied\n- Use `can_place_entity()` check before placement attempts\n- Consider alternative inserter positions around chemical plant\n\n### Prototype Naming Errors\n- Incorrect prototype name format ('OIL-REFINERY' should be 'OilRefinery')\n- Always use exact prototype names from documentation\n\n### System Verification\n- Stop assuming power connections work - always verify with `entity.energy > 0` checks\n- Check fluid system status indicators (FULL_OUTPUT/EMPTY) to diagnose flow issues\n- The petroleum gas pipe system (12453) shows EMPTY - verify refinery outputs are properly connected\n\n### Common Patterns\n- Multiple power network rebuilds without solving core connection issues\n- Repeated assertion failures on power checks without corrective action\n- Not checking entity positions before interaction attempts"}
