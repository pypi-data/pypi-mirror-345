{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Furnace Setup:**\n  - Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with ingredients: {'iron-plate': 80}\n  - Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with ingredients: {'iron-plate': 92}\n- **Inserter Setup:**\n  - Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (61.0, -54.0)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (65.5, -52.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (64.0, -53.0)\n\n#### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Mining Drill:**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a coal resource of 19993, connected to wooden chests and transport belts\n- **Storage:**\n  - Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (42.5, -83.5), (43.5, -83.5), and (44.5, -83.5) storing coal\n\n#### Belt Network\n- **Belt Paths:**\n  - Belt path to inserter 1: from (64.5, -51.5) to (65.5, -50.5)\n  - Belt path to inserter 2: from (65.5, -51.5) to (66.5, -50.5)\n- **Belt Groups:**\n  - Multiple belt groups connecting various positions, including:\n    - From (45.5, -82.5) to (67.5, -54.5)\n    - From (43.5, -80.5) to (63.5, -50.5)\n    - From (42.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -46.5)\n    - From (44.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -54.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors in Belt Connection\n- **Failed Belt Connections:**\n  - Repeated failures to connect transport belts from (43.5, -81.5) to (65.0, -51.0) and (66.0, -51.0) due to invalid path normalization.\n  - **Tip:** Ensure that the path for belt connections is clear and valid. Check for obstacles or incorrect alignment that may prevent successful belt placement.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **Belt Path Function:**\n  - Defined paths for belt connections to inserters, ensuring correct positioning and alignment.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **Inventory:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] = {'wooden-chest': 2, 'transport-belt': 16, 'burner-inserter': 79, 'coal': 2600, 'iron-ore': 57, 'iron-plate': 560, 'iron-gear-wheel': 1588}\n\nThis report reflects the current state of the agent's structures and highlights areas for improvement in belt connectivity."}
