{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=13.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner Inserters positioned to feed coal and remove iron plates\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position with input of automation science packs and status indicating active research on logistics\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5) with status EntityStatus.EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with water fluid and status EntityStatus.WORKING\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=22.5) with steam fluid and status EntityStatus.WORKING\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions and a voltage of 178066\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and not obstructed when connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine. Clear any obstructions in the path before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors with Placement Blockage\n- Verify that there are no placement blockages before attempting to connect entities with pipes. This can be done by ensuring the path is clear of any other entities or obstructions.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- After ensuring all connections are properly made and obstructions cleared, check the steam engine's status and connections to ensure it is generating power. If issues persist, review the setup for any misconfigurations or missing connections."}
