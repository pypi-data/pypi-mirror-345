{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnaces, with a drop position at (-12.5, -48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at Position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at Position (-10.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at Positions (-14.5, -47.5) and (-8.5, -47.5) assisting in the transfer of materials.\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-6.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), (-6.5, -47.5), and (-7.5, -47.5) for storing iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is clear and has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred. Regularly check and clear output destinations to prevent blockages.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify the supply chain to ensure that the source items are available for the inserter to pick up. Maintain a steady flow of resources to prevent idle inserters.\n\n### UnboundLocalError: Cannot Access Local Variable\n- Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and assigned a value before being accessed in the code. Review the code logic to prevent accessing uninitialized variables.\n\n### ValueError: Incorrect Argument Type\n- When using functions like `inspect_inventory`, ensure that the first argument is an Entity or Position object, not an incorrect type like an integer.\n\n### Exception: No Coal to Insert\n- Check the inventory to ensure that there is enough coal available before attempting to insert it into entities like mining drills. Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory.\n\n### AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'furnace_source'\n- Ensure that objects are correctly referenced and that the attributes being accessed exist for the object type. Double-check object types and their attributes to prevent such errors."}
