{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-23.0, y=-66.0) via Transport Belts.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-66.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-65.5) transferring items from a Wooden Chest at position (x=-21.5, y=-65.5) to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items to the Wooden Chest.\n\n### Belt Groups\n- BeltGroup connecting position (x=-25.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-23.5, y=-65.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting position (x=-24.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-59.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that the transport belts are correctly aligned and that the target entities are not `None`. Check the attributes of the entities involved before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
