{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new permanent structures have been successfully established on the map. Multiple attempts were made to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for research\u2014with the Lab meant to serve as the research facility for Automation Science Packs\u2014but none were placed due to inventory and crafting failures. Although furnaces (at positions (5.0, 5.0) and (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were referenced for smelting operations, these were pre\u2010existing processing units and were not newly created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n  \u2013 Ensure that API calls conform to the expected signature. In several instances get_entities was called with an unexpected keyword (\u2018radius\u2019) or with incorrect positional arguments. Verify parameter names and counts before calling to avoid such type and argument errors.\n  \u2013 When a function may return None, implement a proper fallback (for example, converting a None response to an empty list) to prevent iteration errors, as seen when attempting to filter labs.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Failures\n  \u2013 Confirm that the Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement. Errors such as \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d indicate that crafting must first successfully produce the Lab.\n  \u2013 Carefully verify that all sub-ingredients for Lab production (including iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available. Missing prerequisite items led to failures in crafting the Lab.\n  \u2013 Monitor the production chain dependencies; ensure upstream processes (like smelting iron and copper plates) yield sufficient resources to produce the required intermediate components.\n"}
