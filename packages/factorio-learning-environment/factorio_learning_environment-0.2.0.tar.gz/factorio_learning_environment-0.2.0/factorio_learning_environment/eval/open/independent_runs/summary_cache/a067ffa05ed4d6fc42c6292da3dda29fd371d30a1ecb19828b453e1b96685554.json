{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14, -49)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14, -49) and (-12, -48) with a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) feeding into a wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5).\n- Transport belts connecting the furnaces to the wooden chest.\n- Additional burner inserters and chests at positions (-14.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-11.5, -44.5), (-9.5, -44.5), (-14.5, -43.5), (-9.5, -43.5), and (-7.5, -43.5) for efficient material handling and storage.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (1.5, 18.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boilers at positions (1.5, 18.0), (-9.5, 22.0), (-3.5, 22.0), and (0.5, 22.0).\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5) supplying water.\n- Pipe groups connecting the boilers and pump, ensuring fluid transport.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 1.5) and (-4.5, 0.5) for fluid transport.\n- PipeGroup at position (-2.5, 3.5) carrying water, marked as full output.\n- Additional pipe groups at positions (-12.5, 16.5) and (-10.5, 18.5) for fluid distribution.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity poles at various positions, including (-9.5, 14.5), (-6.5, 19.5), and (-4.5, 25.5), forming an electricity network with a voltage of 0.\n\n### Belt Network\n- Belt groups connecting various positions for material transport, including inputs at (-11.5, -46.5) and outputs at (-8.5, -45.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipe-to-Ground\n- Ensure that the location for placing pipe-to-ground is not overlapping with water. Attempt placement on solid ground to avoid footprint overlap errors.\n- Verify the position before attempting to place the underground pipe to ensure it is valid and clear of any obstructions.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Always check the tile for any existing entities or obstacles before placing a new entity to prevent overlap and placement errors."}
