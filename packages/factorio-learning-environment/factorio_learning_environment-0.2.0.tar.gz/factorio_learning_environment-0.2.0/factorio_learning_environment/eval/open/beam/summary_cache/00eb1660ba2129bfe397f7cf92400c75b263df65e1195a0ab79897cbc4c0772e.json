{"content": "The error indicates that there is no steam engine or similar power generator nearby, which is crucial for establishing a power network. Let's troubleshoot and resolve this issue by ensuring that a power source is available and correctly connected to the network.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Verify Power Source Availability:**\n   - Ensure that there is a power source like a steam engine or solar panel in your setup.\n   - If not, consider placing a steam engine connected to a boiler for power generation.\n\n2. **Place a Steam Engine (if necessary):**\n   - If you don't have a steam engine, you need to place one along with a boiler and a water pump.\n   - Ensure the steam engine is connected to a water source and a boiler to generate power.\n\n3. **Connect the Power Source to the Network:**\n   - Once the power source is set up, connect it to the electric poles leading to the assembling machine.\n\n### Example Code to Place a Steam Engine and Connect It:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Place a boiler and steam engine if not already present\ntry:\n    # Place a water pump near a water source\n    water_pump_position = Position(x=2.0, y=2.0)  # Adjust position based on water availability\n    place_entity(Prototype.OffshorePump, Direction.UP, water_pump_position)\n\n    # Place a boiler connected to the water pump\n    boiler_position = Position(x=3.0, y=2.0)\n    place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, Direction.UP, boiler_position)\n\n    # Place a steam engine connected to the boiler\n    steam_engine_position = Position(x=4.0, y=2.0)\n    place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, Direction.UP, steam_engine_position)\n\n    print(\"Successfully placed power generation setup.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error setting up power generation: {e}\")\n\n# Step 2: Connect the steam engine to the electric network\ntry:\n    # Place a small electric pole to connect the steam engine to the network\n    connect_entities(steam_engine_position, Position(x=4.5, y=2.5), Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\n    print(\"Connected steam engine to the electric network.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error connecting steam engine to the network: {e}\")\n\n# Step 3: Verify the power status of the assembling machine\nfinal_machine_status = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Final power status of the assembling machine: \", final_machine_status)\n\n# Print the updated entity list to confirm changes\nprint(f\"Updated entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n\n- Ensure that the water pump is placed adjacent to a water source.\n- Connect the boiler to the water pump and the steam engine to the boiler.\n- Use small electric poles to connect the steam engine to the rest of the power network.\n- Verify that all components are properly aligned and connected.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to establish a functional power network and resolve the power issues with the assembling machine.", "summary_range": "[1-134]"}
