However, due to inventory shortages and missing sub-ingredients, no Lab was successfully created on the map.\n\n### Iron Plate Furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\u2022 Use-case: Utilized for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\u2022 Details: The agent interacted with this furnace for resource processing. Note that this furnace was not constructed by the agent but was referenced during iron plate production.\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\n\u2022 Use-case: Utilized for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\u2022 Details: The agent accessed this structure to convert copper ore into copper plates. As with the iron furnace, it was pre-existing and not newly created.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage Errors:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Avoid supplying unsupported arguments when calling get_entities. In one instance a keyword 'radius' was passed and in another the function was given extra positional arguments. Verify the function\u2019s signature and pass only the accepted arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Failures:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Confirm that a Lab item is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, and copper-plates) are available or producible through an established production chain.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Guard against iterating over None by validating that functions like get_entities return a proper iterable (or falling back to an empty list).\n\n\u2022 Production Pipeline Shortcomings:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Prior to crafting complex items like the Lab, verify that ancillary processes (smelting for iron and copper, crafting intermediary parts) have yielded sufficient materials.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Address recurring shortages (for example, missing iron-gear-wheels) by ensuring resource conversion steps are completed successfully before reattempting construction."}
