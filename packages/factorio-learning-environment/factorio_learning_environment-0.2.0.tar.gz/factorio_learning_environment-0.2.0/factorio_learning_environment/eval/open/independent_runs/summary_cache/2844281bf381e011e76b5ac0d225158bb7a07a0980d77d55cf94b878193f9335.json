{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electric Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole at position (2.5, 2.5) - Status: NOT PLUGGED IN ELECTRIC NETWORK\n- Small Electric Pole at position (9.5, 6.5) - Connected to lab at position (6.5, 6.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (9.5, 8.5) - Connected to lab at position (6.5, 6.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (1.5, 1.5) - Connected to lab at position (6.5, 6.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (2.5, 2.5) - Connected to lab at position (6.5, 6.5)\n\n### Lab\nLocated at position (6.5, 6.5) - Currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to Electric Network\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed within the range of each other to create a connected network. The lab requires power from connected poles.\n- Check the status of electric poles regularly to confirm they are plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required entities in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, the error \"Could not place small-electric-pole at (8.0, 9.0), No small_electric_pole in inventory\" indicates a lack of the required item.\n- Verify that the position you are trying to place an entity is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Make sure that the entities you are trying to connect (like electric poles and labs) are within reach of each other to establish a proper connection."}
