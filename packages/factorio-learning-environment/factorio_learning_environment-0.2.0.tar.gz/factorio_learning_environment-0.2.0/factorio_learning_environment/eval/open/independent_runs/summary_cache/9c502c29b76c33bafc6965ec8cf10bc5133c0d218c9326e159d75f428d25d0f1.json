{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', status: NOT_CONNECTED.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with warning 'out of fuel', status: NO_FUEL.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), status: WORKING.\n- **Pipe Network** connecting the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions such as (x=-0.5, y=21.5), (x=1.5, y=21.5), and others.\n- **Pipe-to-Ground** at position (x=16.5, y=17.5) and **Pipe** at position (x=17.5, y=17.5).\n\n### Water Supply System\n- **Pipe Group** (fluid_system=13478) starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status: FULL_OUTPUT, carrying water.\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at various positions such as (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=7.5, y=8.5), and others, voltage: 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are within a valid range and that the pipe network is correctly configured to allow fluid flow. Verify that all necessary connection points are properly aligned and that there are no obstructions.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers to maintain continuous operation. Consider setting up automated refueling systems using inserters and belts to ensure a steady supply of fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: Attempted to connect a boiler to a steam engine using pipes but failed due to invalid connections. Ensure that the entities are properly aligned and that the correct pipe types are used.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **pipes**: List of pipe entities used for connecting various components.\n- **boiler**: Represents the boiler entity at position (x=1.5, y=23.0).\n- **steam_engine**: Represents the steam engine entity at position (x=17.5, y=20.5).\n- **offshore_pump**: Represents the offshore pump entity at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)."}
