{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) collecting coal\n- Current status: Mining drill is out of fuel\n\n### Iron Smelting System at (45.0, -81.0) to (47.0, -81.0)\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Two output wooden chests at (45.5, -83.5) and (47.5, -83.5) containing iron plates\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) moving items from furnaces to chests\n- Current status: Furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Distribution System at (46.5, -77.5)\n- Input wooden chest at (46.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5)\n- Transport belts at (45.5, -79.5) and (47.5, -79.5)\n- Storage chests at (49.5, -80.5) and (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Multiple attempts to adjust inserter orientations and positions indicate problems with item flow\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with source and destination entities\n- Verify inserter rotation matches the intended flow direction before placement\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drill running out of fuel indicates need for automated fuel supply system\n- Consider implementing automated coal distribution to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Storage Management\n- Multiple chests are reaching full capacity (\"chest is full\" warnings)\n- Implement better storage management or item distribution to prevent backlog\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `input_chest`: Wooden chest entity\n- `left_inserter`, `right_inserter`: Burner inserter entities\n- `left_furnace`, `right_furnace`: Stone furnace entities\n\n### Entity States\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`: Common state for inserters waiting for items\n- `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`: State for furnaces without materials to process\n- `EntityStatus.NO_FUEL`: State for entities requiring fuel to operate\n- `EntityStatus.NORMAL`: Default operational state for entities"}
