{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNone\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Could not find a buildable area\n- The agent repeatedly failed to find a buildable area for the assembling machine, even after moving to different locations. This suggests that the `nearest_buildable` tool is not functioning as expected or that the areas being searched are genuinely obstructed.\n- Solution: Investigate the `nearest_buildable` tool's implementation and ensure it correctly identifies buildable areas. Consider clearing potential obstructions (trees, rocks) in the target areas before attempting to build.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\nNone\n"}
