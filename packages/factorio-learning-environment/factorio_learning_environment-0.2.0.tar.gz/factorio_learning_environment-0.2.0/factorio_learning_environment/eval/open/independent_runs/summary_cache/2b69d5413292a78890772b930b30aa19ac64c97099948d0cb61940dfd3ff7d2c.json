{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 1062) with pipes at Positions (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), and (-7.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Small Electric Poles connecting to the Steam Engine at various positions\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Small Electric Poles near the Inserter and Wooden Chest\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -59.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron and copper plates\n- Inserter for item transfer\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Establishing Pipe Connections\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before placing pipes. Clear existing objects if necessary to avoid placement failure.\n\n### Errors with Fluid System Connections\n- Verify that all components (Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine) are connected to the same fluid system to ensure proper fluid flow.\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Functionality\n- Check that the Boiler is receiving input liquid and is properly connected to the fluid system. Ensure the Steam Engine is connected to the power network and receiving input liquid.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure Inserters are connected to a power source. Verify that Small Electric Poles are correctly placed to supply power to Inserters and other electrical entities.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status and warnings of entities to identify and resolve issues promptly."}
