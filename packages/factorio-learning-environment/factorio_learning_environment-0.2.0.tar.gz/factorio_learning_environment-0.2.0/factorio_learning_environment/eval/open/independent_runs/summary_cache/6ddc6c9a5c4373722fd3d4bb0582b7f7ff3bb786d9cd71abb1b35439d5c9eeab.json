{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) for moving items.\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the inserter with belts from positions (-22.5, -69.5) to (-26.5, -69.5).\n\n### Coal Mining System at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storage.\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the storage with belts from positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) moving items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts\n- Ensure there are no gaps in belt placement when connecting entities. Verify that all belts are placed continuously without any missing segments.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target location is clear of any existing objects to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as burner inserters and mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations."}
