{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nThis structure is responsible for generating electricity by converting water into steam and then using it to produce power. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5): Extracts water from a nearby water source.\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0): Heats the water to produce steam. It is connected to the offshore pump via a series of pipes.\n- **PipeGroup**: Connects the offshore pump to the boiler, ensuring the flow of water. The pipes are positioned at various coordinates, including (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), and extend to (-4.5, 24.5).\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nThis structure is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates. Currently, it has a warning status indicating \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure that the area where you intend to place an entity is free from obstacles and is suitable for placement. For example, the boiler could not be placed next to the offshore pump due to water occupying the intended space. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- When performing calculations involving entity dimensions or positions, ensure that the data types are compatible. The error \"unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'ModelPrivateAttr' and 'int'\" suggests an attempt to add incompatible types. Verify that all variables are properly defined and initialized before performing arithmetic operations.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are present in your inventory. For instance, the error \"No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates a lack of coal when trying to fuel the boiler.\n- Similarly, ensure that you have the necessary items to craft components. The error \"Failed to craft 10x pipe because couldn't craft a required sub-ingredient for pipe - iron-plate\" suggests insufficient iron plates for crafting pipes.\n\n### Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. The error \"name 'steam_engine' is not defined\" indicates that the variable was referenced before being declared or assigned a value.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- When connecting entities, make sure you have the required items in your inventory to establish the connection. The error \"Failed to connect {'Pipe'} from offshore-pump to boiler\" suggests a lack of pipes needed for the connection. Ensure you have crafted or acquired the necessary components before attempting to connect entities."}
