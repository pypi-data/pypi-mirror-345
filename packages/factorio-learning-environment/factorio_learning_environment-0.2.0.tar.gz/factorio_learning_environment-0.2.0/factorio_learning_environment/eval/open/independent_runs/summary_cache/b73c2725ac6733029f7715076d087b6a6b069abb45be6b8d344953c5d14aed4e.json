{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 5})\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5), Burner inserter at (x=-13.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (10,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Inventory: {'iron-ore': 16}\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 9})\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours: Burner mining drill at (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), Transport belt at (x=-12.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-14.5, y=-51.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-12.5, y=-51.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 4})\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Inventory({'iron-ore': 1})\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 41})\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 9})\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours: Transport belt at (x=0.5, y=-2.5), Stone furnace at (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=0.5, y=-2.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=0.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### Transport System\n- **Belt Group**\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction=RIGHT\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction=DOWN\n  - Status: Empty\n  - Belts: 75 belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, when inserting coal into a mining drill, confirm that coal is present in your inventory.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent blockages in production. For instance, the warning indicates that the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) is full, which halts mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Function to insert items into a specified entity. Ensure that the item and quantity are available in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `mining_drill`: Represents a mining drill entity used in the insert_item function.\n- `quantity`: Integer representing the number of items to be inserted into an entity."}
