{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, currently working but output inventory often full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational, moving items between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt drop position remains unresolved, causing mining drill to wait for space.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and intermediate storage but suffers from output congestion limiting throughput.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working but occasionally runs out of fuel.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and others forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity for the factory\u2019s network, though boiler fuel management needs attention.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) intended to feed iron plates into assembly.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items to output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and correctly positioned.\n- Assembling machine remains idle due to lack of iron plate input inventory.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production but cannot operate without input materials being supplied.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace output belt\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) is waiting due to \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked.\"\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, indicating downstream storage or belt congestion.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and chests to ensure continuous item flow.\n- Verify inserters and belts downstream are not full or jammed.\n\n### Assembling machine input supply issues\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) has empty input and output inventories despite power and inserter setup.\n- Iron plates are extracted and inserted back into input chest at (21.5, 75.5) but never reach assembling machine input.\n- Ensure inserters or belts correctly transport iron plates from input chest to assembling machine.\n- Check inserter pickup and drop positions and that no blockage or misplacement prevents item transfer.\n\n### Small electric pole placement conflicts\n- Multiple failed attempts to place small electric poles near key entities (steam engine at (0.5, 6.5), mining drill at (17.5, 72.5), furnace at (18.0, 75.0), assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5)) due to occupied tiles.\n- Suggested solutions include increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or adjusting reference positions.\n- Always verify tile occupancy before placement to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Fuel management for boilers and inserters\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) occasionally runs out of fuel, causing temporary power interruptions.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled but require ongoing monitoring.\n- Maintain regular coal insertion into boilers and inserters to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Inserter positioning and operation\n- Inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are correctly positioned and fueled.\n- However, some inserters report waiting for source items"}
