{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-14, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24, -15) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) collecting coal output\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14, 23) mining iron ore (currently out of fuel)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) collecting iron ore\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11, 20) and (-9, 20) for smelting\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Complex at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20, 20) mining copper ore\n- Complex inserter and chest network:\n  - Output wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n  - Middle wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5) storing copper ore\n  - Final wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) storing copper plates\n- Stone furnace at (24, 20) for smelting\n- Multiple burner inserters for automation:\n  - Inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving ore between chests\n  - Inserter at (22.5, 20.5) feeding furnace\n  - Inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving finished plates\n  - Support inserters at (20.5, 22.5) and (22.5, 22.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests - use inserters instead to move items from chests onto belts\n\n### Errors with furnace fuel management\n- Check furnace fuel capacity before attempting to insert more coal\n- Current furnace at (24, 20) is at maximum fuel capacity (50/50)\n\n### General automation tips\n- Multiple inserters are idle waiting for source items - ensure proper item flow in the production chain\n- One mining drill is out of fuel - implement regular fuel resupply system for all machines"}
