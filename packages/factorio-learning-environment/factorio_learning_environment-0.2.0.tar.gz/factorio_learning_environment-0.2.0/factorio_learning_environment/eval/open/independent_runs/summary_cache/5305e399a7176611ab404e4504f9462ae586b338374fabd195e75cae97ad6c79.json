{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mining Operation at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of a Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0) with a fuel inventory of {'coal': 49}, and two Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Transport System at position(39.5, -81.5)\nConsists of a Burner Inserter at position(39.5, -81.5) with a fuel inventory of {'coal': 21}, which is used to transport coal from the mining operation to other parts of the factory.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of {'coal': 30}, which is used to smelt iron plates.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when mining coal**: Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before continuing to mine coal. Empty the chest at the designated position to resolve this issue.\n* **Errors when smelting iron plates**: Ensure that there are ingredients to smelt in the furnace. Provide the necessary ingredients to resolve this issue.\n* **Errors when using the inserter**: Ensure that the inserter has a source of items to pick up. Provide a source of items to resolve this issue.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* **Utility functions**: None defined.\n* **Important variables**:\n  * `coal_chest`: a chest used to store coal.\n  * `iron_chest`: a chest used to store iron plates.\n  * `drill`: a burner mining drill used to mine coal.\n  * `inserter`: a burner inserter used to transport coal.\n  * `furnace`: a furnace used to smelt iron plates."}
