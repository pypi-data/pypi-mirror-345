{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) for transferring coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that there is enough of the required item in your inventory before attempting to insert it into another entity. For example, trying to insert coal without having any in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Check that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting for source items, it may indicate that the source entity is empty or not producing items.\n\n### Errors when furnace result inventory is full\n- Regularly empty the furnace result inventory to prevent production halts. Ensure there is a mechanism (e.g., inserters, chests) to automatically remove items from the furnace output.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wood', 'coal', and 'iron-plate'.\n- `furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the furnace, including 'iron-ore' and 'iron-plate'."}
