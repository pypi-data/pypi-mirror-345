{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, extracting iron ore from the nearby wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5).\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing 678 iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt and is full of fuel.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing 661 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract from the Stone Furnace\n- Ensure that there are iron plates available in the Stone Furnace before attempting to extract. Check the inventory of the furnace to confirm availability.\n\n### Errors when the wooden chest at drop position is full\n- Empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining. Ensure that there is enough space in the chest to receive items from the mining drill.\n\n### Errors when no ingredients are available for smelting\n- Verify that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. If it is empty, gather the required materials before attempting to smelt.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined yet.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_count: int` - Total count of iron ore available in the wooden chest.\n  - `iron_plate_count: int` - Total count of iron plates available in the wooden chest.\n  - `coal_count: int` - Total count of coal available in the inventory.\n  - `furnace_status: str` - Current status of the Stone Furnace (e.g., NO_INGREDIENTS).\n  - `mining_drill_status: str` - Current status of the Burner Mining Drill (e.g., WORKING)."}
