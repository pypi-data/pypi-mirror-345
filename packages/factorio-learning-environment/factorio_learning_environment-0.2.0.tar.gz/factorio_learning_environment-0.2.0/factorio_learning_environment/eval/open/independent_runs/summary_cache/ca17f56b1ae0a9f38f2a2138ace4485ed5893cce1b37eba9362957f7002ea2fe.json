For example, iron-plates cannot be crafted without a furnace or crafting machine.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft sub-ingredients\n- Verify that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item that depends on them. For instance, iron-sticks require iron-plates, which must be crafted first."}
