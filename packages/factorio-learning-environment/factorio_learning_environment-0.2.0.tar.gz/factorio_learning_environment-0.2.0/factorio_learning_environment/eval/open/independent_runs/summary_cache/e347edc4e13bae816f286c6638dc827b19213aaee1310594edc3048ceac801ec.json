{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) for iron ore collection.\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with a status of `NO_INGREDIENTS`, indicating it requires more iron ore to continue smelting.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) currently `WORKING` with iron ore and coal as fuel.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) currently `WORKING` with iron ore and coal as fuel.\n\n### Storage and Logistics\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** positioned around the mining and smelting area for storage:\n  - Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (7.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (6.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (9.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (8.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Chest at position (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Output Warnings\n- Ensure to regularly extract items from furnaces to prevent them from reaching a `FULL_OUTPUT` status, which stops further production.\n\n### No Ingredients Warnings\n- Maintain a steady supply of iron ore to furnaces to avoid `NO_INGREDIENTS` warnings, which halt production until more resources are supplied.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of coal inventory to prevent errors related to insufficient fuel, as seen with the error \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Chest Management\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from stopping due to a full chest warning.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It failed due to insufficient coal in the inventory, indicating the need for better inventory management.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int, representing the number of wooden chests in the inventory.\n- `coal`: int, representing the amount of coal available for fueling entities.\n- `iron-ore`: int, representing the amount of iron ore available for smelting.\n- `iron-plate`: int, representing the number of iron plates produced and available.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int, representing the number of iron gear wheels in the inventory."}
