{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting System at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0) smelting copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing output plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates from furnace to chest\n\n###Iron Mining and Processing Complex (-10 to -4, -60 to -55)\nConsists of three mining drills in sequence:\n1. First mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0)\n2. Middle mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0)\n3. Last mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0)\nSupporting infrastructure:\n- Multiple wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting ore\n- Network of burner inserters at (-6.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -56.5), (-4.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -56.5) moving materials\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n###Iron Smelting Array (0 to 6, 0 to 2)\nFour parallel smelting lines, each consisting of:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input inserters and chests above furnaces\n- Output inserters and chests below furnaces at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if target location is clear before placing new entities\n- When placing collection chests, ensure the drop position of mining drills is not already occupied\n\n### Entity blockage issues\n- Mining drill outputs are being blocked due to missing or full output containers\n- Furnace belts are blocked at drop positions - ensure proper item flow through the system\n- Set up proper item collection systems before starting mining/processing operations\n\n### Resource management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices regularly\n- Ensure all burner entities (drills, inserters) have adequate coal supply\n- Set up refueling systems to maintain continuous operation"}
