{"content": "\"\"\"\nAfter waiting for the furnace to process the newly inserted copper ore, the results indicate that:\n- The furnace still holds **5 pieces of copper ore**.\n- **9 pieces of iron plates** have been produced so far.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 3 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 2 pieces of coal remaining for fuel\n- **5 pieces of copper ore** (still in the furnace).\n- **9 pieces of iron plates** (produced).\n\n### Furnace Status:\nThe furnace is marked as **\"FULL_OUTPUT,\"** indicating it is at capacity for output but has not produced any copper plates from the copper ore.\n\n### Analysis:\nDespite multiple attempts to process copper ore, it appears that the furnace is not generating any output from the copper ore. This could be due to:\n1. **Recipe Availability**: The recipes for processing copper ore may still be disabled.\n2. **Insufficient Resources**: The furnace may require additional resources (like copper plates) or technology advancements to process copper ore into a usable form.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Recipe Availability**: I should investigate the recipes available for copper processing to see if any prerequisites are missing.\n2. **Gather Additional Resources**: If the output remains stalled, I can focus on gathering more resources or exploring new technologies that could unlock further crafting options.\n3. **Consider Alternative Production**: If copper processing is blocked, I might want to look into other items that can be crafted with the iron plates or explore setting up additional production lines.\n\nLet's check the available recipes for copper processing to determine the next course of action.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for available recipes that can be crafted using copper ore\navailable_recipe_copper_plate = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.CopperPlate)\nprint(f\"Recipe for Copper Plate: {available_recipe_copper_plate}\")\n\n# Display complete current inventory for a broader insight into options\ncomplete_current_inventory_status = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Complete current inventory: {complete_current_inventory_status}\")  # Check complete inventory status again.", "summary_range": "[1-174]"}
