{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Smelting Setup at position(0.0, 0.0)\n[REMOVED - No longer exists on map based on latest entity data]\n\n###Copper and Iron Mining/Smelting Setup with Collection System at position(-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- First burner mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0), rotated downward\n- Second burner mining drill at position (-26.0, -61.0), rotated downward\n- First furnace at position (-27.0, -58.0)\n- Second furnace at position (-25.0, -58.0)\n- Collection system for copper furnace:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-26.5, -56.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position (-26.5, -55.5)\n- Collection system for iron furnace:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-24.5, -56.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position (-24.5, -55.5)\nAll entities are currently without fuel and not operational.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when trying to place entities in already occupied positions\n- Before placing furnaces or other entities, verify the target position is completely free\n- Check if any entity's working area or drop position overlaps with the intended placement location\n- Consider the full tile dimensions of both existing and new entities when planning placement\n\n### Errors when trying to place inserters in invalid positions\n- When placing inserters next to mining drills, ensure the position doesn't conflict with the drill's drop position\n- Consider the tile dimensions and working area of existing entities before placing inserters\n- For mining drills, the drop position is a critical operational point and cannot be blocked by other entities\n- When placing inserters, ensure there's enough clearance from other entities' working areas\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces or drills, try increasing the spacing parameter if initial placement fails\n\n### Errors related to entity spacing and direction\n- When using place_entity_next_to, carefully consider the spacing parameter\n- If placement fails, try increasing the spacing value\n- Consider alternative directions when the desired placement direction is blocked\n- Verify that the reference position and direction combination will result in a valid placement\n\n### Errors related to inventory management and item insertion\n- Always verify required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into entities\n- Keep track of inventory contents when planning operations\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items into furnaces or other entities\n\n### Errors related to entity verification\n- Always verify entity existence at specific coordinates before attempting operations on them\n- Implement position verification before attempting to access or manipulate entities\n- Keep track of entity positions and update them if entities are removed or replaced\n- When referencing entities by position, ensure the entity still exists at that position\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Monitor fuel levels of all powered entities (mining drills, inserters, furnaces)\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available before starting a refueling operation\n- Complete refueling operations for all entities in one pass to maintain efficiency\n- Keep track of coal consumption rates to maintain continuous operation\n- Implement a systematic refueling routine to keep all entities operational\n- Verify coal is in inventory before attempting to refuel entities\n\n### Errors when trying to reference non-existent entities\n- When using place_entity_next_to, ensure the reference entity position exists and is valid\n- Double check coordinates when referencing entity positions\n- Verify entity existence before attempting to use it as a reference point"}
