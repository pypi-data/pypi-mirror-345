{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at position (-13.5, -75.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Storage Facilities\n- Iron Chest at position (-13.5, -75.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple PipeGroups with various statuses and fluid systems, primarily empty, indicating incomplete or non-functional connections.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using non-subscriptable objects\n- Ensure that objects like `PipeGroup` are used correctly and are not treated as subscriptable. Consider using appropriate methods to access their properties.\n\n### Errors in connecting entities\n- When connecting pipes between entities like offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines, ensure that the connections are correctly aligned and that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Steam Engine not generating power\n- Verify that all connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine are complete and that there is a continuous flow of water and steam. Check for any warnings or errors in the connections.\n\n### Inserter not receiving electricity\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source and that the power network is functional. Verify the placement of electric poles and their connections to the inserters.\n\n### Output blocked by item on the ground\n- Ensure that there is a valid destination for the output of mining drills and that the path is clear of any obstructions. Consider using belts or chests to manage the output efficiently."}
