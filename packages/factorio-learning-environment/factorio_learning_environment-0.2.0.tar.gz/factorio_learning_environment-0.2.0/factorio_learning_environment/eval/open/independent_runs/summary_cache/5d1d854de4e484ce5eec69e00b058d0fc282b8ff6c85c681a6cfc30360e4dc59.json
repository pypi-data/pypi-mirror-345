{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates and consists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1**: Located at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), this furnace is currently full with 100 iron plates and is experiencing a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n- **Furnace 2**: Located at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), this furnace is also full with 100 iron plates and has a warning of \"furnace result is full\".\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: Positioned at (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), this drill is fueled with coal and is actively working, extracting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**: \n  - Inserter 1 at (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), waiting for source items.\n  - Inserter 2 at (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), working but waiting for source items.\n  - Inserter 3 at (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), waiting for source items.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Chest 1 at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), empty.\n  - Chest 2 at (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), empty.\n  - Chest 3 at (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), containing 204 iron ore.\n  - Chest 4 at (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), empty.\n  - Chest 5 at (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), containing 315 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space or Source Items\n- Ensure that the destination chest or entity for the inserter has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred.\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items like coal, ensure that your inventory contains the necessary items to complete the action.\n\n### Furnace and Inserter Efficiency\n- Regularly check furnaces to ensure they have ingredients to process and that their output is being cleared to prevent production halts.\n- Monitor inserters to ensure they are properly fueled and have access to both source and destination entities."}
