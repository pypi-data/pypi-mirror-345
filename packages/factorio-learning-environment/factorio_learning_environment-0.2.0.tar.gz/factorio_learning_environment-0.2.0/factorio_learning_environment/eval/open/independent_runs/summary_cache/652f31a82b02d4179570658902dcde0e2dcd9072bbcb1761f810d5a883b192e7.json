The connection between the boiler and the steam engine has been successfully re-established by placing a pipe segment at the boiler's steam output. The system is now operational and providing power.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water. Status: `WORKING`.\n*   **Pipe Group** from Position(x=-8.5, y=-0.5) to Position(x=-4.5, y=0.5): Transports water to the boiler. Status: `WORKING`.\n*   **Boiler** at Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5): Heats water into steam using coal. Status: `WORKING`. Steam output at Position(x=-6.5, y=2.5). Fueled manually in step 42.\n*   **Pipe Group** from Position(x=-6.5, y=2.5) to Position(x=-2.5, y=6.5): Transports steam to the engine. Status: `WORKING`.\n*   **Steam Engine** at Position(x="}
