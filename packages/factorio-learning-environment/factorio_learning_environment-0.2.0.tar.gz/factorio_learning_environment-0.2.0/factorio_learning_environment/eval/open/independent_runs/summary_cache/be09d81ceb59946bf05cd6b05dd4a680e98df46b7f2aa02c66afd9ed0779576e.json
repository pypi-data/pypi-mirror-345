{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a furnace source containing iron-ore and a furnace result containing copper-plate.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack and currently has no power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from non-existent or empty entities\n- Ensure that the stone furnace contains the required items before attempting to extract them. Check the furnace's inventory to confirm the presence of items.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Iron plates cannot be crafted directly; they must be smelted in a furnace. Ensure you have the necessary crafting machines or furnaces to produce sub-ingredients like iron plates.\n- Verify that all sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft complex items like electronic circuits, iron gear wheels, transport belts, and labs.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is available in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n\n### Errors when locating entities\n- Make sure that the target entity, such as a steam engine, exists on the map before trying to find its position. If not, consider placing one if needed.\n\n### Errors due to missing resources for crafting\n- Gather or craft the necessary resources before attempting to craft items like solar panels. Check for missing resources and ensure they are available in your inventory."}
