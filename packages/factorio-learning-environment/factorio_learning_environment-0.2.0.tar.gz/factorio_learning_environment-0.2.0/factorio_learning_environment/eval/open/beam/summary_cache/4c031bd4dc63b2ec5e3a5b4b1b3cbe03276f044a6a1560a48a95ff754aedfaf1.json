{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Current fuel: 6 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 1.0)\n  - Current fuel: 3 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Inventory: 1 iron plate\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fueled with 2 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Drop position: Wooden Chest at (-15.5, -51.5)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -50.0)\n  - Fueled with 4 units of coal\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Drop position: Intended at (-16.5, -51.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5)\n  - Inventory: 15 iron ore\n\n### Coal Mining Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (37.0, -85.0)\n  - Fueled with 2 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Drop position: Wooden Chest at (36.5, -86.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (36.5, -86.5)\n  - Inventory: 17 coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is available in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, a stone furnace or wooden chest must be crafted or acquired before placement.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For instance, ensure you have coal before trying to fuel a mining drill.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Make sure all sub-ingredients are available before crafting complex items. For example, ensure you have enough iron plates and iron gear wheels when crafting a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an entity with no valid contents\n- Confirm that the entity contains the items you wish to extract. For instance, check that there is iron ore in the chest before attempting to extract it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. Remove existing entities if necessary to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Errors when attempting to gather non-existent resources\n- Verify the presence of resources at the target location before attempting to gather them. For instance, ensure there is iron ore at the specified position before placing a mining drill.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities without available space\n- Check that the destination entity has space for the items you wish to insert. For example, ensure furnaces have room for more ingredients before inserting additional iron ore."}
