{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=5.5, y=27.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various components\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (x=17.5, y=0.5) and (x=16.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=18.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Fluid Transport System\nConsists of multiple Pipe Groups:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-14.5, y=14.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-14.5, y=17.5) with status WORKING, transporting water\n- PipeGroup at position (x=1.5, y=29.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, transporting water\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that the correct type of pipe (either 'Pipe' or 'UndergroundPipe') is used and properly aligned between the offshore pump and the boiler. Check the connection points and ensure there are no obstructions or misalignments that could prevent the connection.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network using small electric poles. Ensure that all components in the electricity generation setup are correctly linked to facilitate energy transfer.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to an active power network. Check the connections with electric poles and ensure the power network is functioning correctly.\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Confirm that the boiler is connected to a working fluid system. Check the fluid system for any blockages or disconnections that might prevent water from reaching the boiler.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be improved significantly."}
