{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map as no entities have been successfully placed. The attempts to place entities such as transport belts and wooden chests have failed due to various errors, as detailed in the ERROR TIPS section.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place a Transport Belt or Wooden Chest**: Ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another entity or obstacle before attempting to place an item. Check the surroundings for any obstacles that might prevent placement.\n\n### Errors related to movement\n- **Cannot move due to incorrect data type**: When using the `move_to` function, ensure that the position indices are integers. Avoid using strings as indices, as this will cause an exception.\n\n### General tips for avoiding placement errors\n- **Obstacle Detection**: Before placing any entity, perform a scan of the area to detect any obstacles. This will help in identifying suitable locations for placement.\n- **Position Verification**: Always verify the position coordinates before attempting to place an entity to ensure they are within the valid range and not obstructed.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in constructing structures and managing resources on the map."}
