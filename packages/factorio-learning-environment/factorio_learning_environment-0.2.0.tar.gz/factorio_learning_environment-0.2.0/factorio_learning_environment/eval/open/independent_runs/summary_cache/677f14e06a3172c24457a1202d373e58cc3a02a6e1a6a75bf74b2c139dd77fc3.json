Regularly check and refuel inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly check the inventory status of chests and clear them when full to prevent halting of mining operations. Ensure that there is enough storage capacity for mined resources.\n\n### Errors when furnaces lack ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain production. Monitor the input inventory of furnaces and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Errors when mining drills are out of resources\n- Ensure that mining drills have access to sufficient resources. Regularly check the resource availability in the mining area and relocate drills if necessary."}
