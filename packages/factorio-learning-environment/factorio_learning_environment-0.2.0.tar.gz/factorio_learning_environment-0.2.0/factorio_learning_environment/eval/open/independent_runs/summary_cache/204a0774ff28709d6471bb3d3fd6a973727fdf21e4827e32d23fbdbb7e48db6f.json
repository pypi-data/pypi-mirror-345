{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) with 25 coal as fuel\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups\nCurrent status: Operational with steam production of approximately 1194 units per minute\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (33.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position (33.5, 20.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (33.5, 22.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (35.5, 22.5) containing 298 coal\n- Inserter at position (34.5, 22.5) to move coal from first chest to second chest\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nCurrent status: Operational, producing approximately 43 coal per minute\n\n### Oil Processing Facility at (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5) extracting crude oil\n- Oil refinery at position (25.5, 45.5) set to basic oil processing\n- Petroleum storage tank at position (32.5, 47.5)\n- Chemical plant at position (39.5, 51.5) set to produce plastic bars\n- Coal chest at position (39.5, 48.5) containing 17 coal\n- Plastic output inserter at position (39.5, 55.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nCurrent status: Partially operational - producing petroleum gas (405 units per minute) but chemical plant has fluid ingredient shortage and the system lacks proper connections between components\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity connections\n- When connecting entities with power poles, ensure the pole is placed in a valid position where it can reach both entities\n- Remember that you cannot connect transport belts directly from a chest - you need an inserter to take items from the chest first\n- When connecting fluid-based entities, ensure the source entity already contains the fluid before attempting to connect to a destination that requires that specific fluid type\n- When trying to connect distant fluid entities (like pumpjack to oil refinery or refinery to storage tank), make sure there's a valid path for the pipes to follow and no connection points are blocked\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Check for existing entities (like pipes or power poles) before placing new entities to avoid collisions\n- When placing entities next to others, consider increasing the spacing parameter if placement fails\n- Be aware of the direction parameter when placing entities, as it affects where the entity's connection points will be\n- When placing inserters, check that both pickup and drop positions are clear and valid\n- For chest placement, verify the target position is not already occupied by another entity or item\n- When placing an inserter to feed a chemical plant, carefully check the surrounding area for obstructions and ensure proper alignment with input/output positions\n- Before placing a pipe at a specific position, check if there's already a pipe or other entity at that location\n\n### Errors with belt systems\n- When creating belt systems, ensure the pickup and drop positions are not already occupied by other entities\n- For inserters, verify that their pickup and drop positions are clear before attempting to connect them with belts\n- Belt connections between distant entities (like from coal mining to chemical plant) require a complete path of connected belts\n\n### API usage errors\n- Use the correct function names - for example, use 'connect_entities' instead of 'connect'\n- Pay attention to function parameter requirements and entity compatibility\n- When attempting to connect entities that are far apart, create intermediate connections rather than trying to connect them directly\n- When using functions like get_entity(), ensure the entity actually exists at the specified position before attempting to access it\n- Before attempting to access properties of an entity (like drop_position), verify that the entity exists and is of the expected type\n\n### Power network issues\n- Ensure all electrical entities are properly connected to the power network\n- Remember that the steam engine needs to be connected to the power grid to distribute electricity\n\n### Chemical plant and oil processing issues\n- When setting up a chemical plant for plastic production, ensure there's a reliable way to feed coal into it\n- For fluid connections to chemical plants, make sure the source entity (like a storage tank) already contains the required fluid\n- Position inserters carefully around chemical plants to avoid placement conflicts with pipes"}
