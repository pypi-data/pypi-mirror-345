{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal and currently operational.\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Contains iron ore: 22 units.\n  - Positioned to receive iron ore from the mining drill.\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - Warnings: Out of fuel. Needs refueling to operate.\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fueled with coal.\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt. Requires iron ore input.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Inserter Setup is Incorrect\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Verify that the pickup and drop positions are correctly set.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel all entities that require fuel, such as mining drills and inserters, to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when Chest is Full\n- Monitor the inventory of chests and ensure they have enough space to receive items from mining drills. Empty chests regularly to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors when Furnace is Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Ensure that the inserter is operational and correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for any misalignment or lack of fuel in the inserter.\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of essential resources like coal to prevent operational disruptions. Plan resource collection and refueling activities accordingly."}
