{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently mining iron ore and has a drop position at Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5).\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which is receiving iron ore from the Burner Mining Drill.\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently smelting iron ore into iron plates but has no ingredients to smelt at the moment.\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) which contains iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient resources\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel the Burner Mining Drill. Check your inventory regularly to avoid running out of fuel.\n- If you encounter \"No iron ore available in the original Wooden Chest to extract,\" make sure to keep the chest stocked with iron ore by regularly extracting from the mining drill.\n\n### Errors when the chest is full\n- The warning \"chest at drop position is full\" indicates that the Wooden Chest cannot accept more items. Regularly empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to ensure the Burner Mining Drill can continue mining.\n\n### Errors related to smelting\n- The warning \"no ingredients to smelt\" from the Stone Furnace indicates that you need to feed it iron ore. Ensure you have a steady supply of iron ore to keep the smelting process running.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int (3163) - The amount of iron ore currently in the player's inventory.\n- `coal`: int (4) - The amount of coal currently in the player's inventory.\n- `iron_plate`: int (100) - The amount of iron plates currently in the player's inventory."}
