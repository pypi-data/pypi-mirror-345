The stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is operational but has no ingredients to smelt.\n2. Other furnaces on the map are either out of fuel or have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Next Steps\nNow that we have sufficient wood and iron ore, we can:\n1. Place the stone furnace at a suitable position (if not already placed).\n2. Insert wood as fuel into the stone furnace.\n3. Insert the gathered iron ore into the stone furnace for smelting.\n\nLet's proceed to set up the stone furnace for smelting the iron ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Place the stone furnace at a specified position (if not already placed)\nfurnace_position = Position(x=0.0, y=0.0)  # Position for the furnace\nnew_furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_position)\n\n# Insert wood as fuel into the stone furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Wood, new_furnace, quantity=5)  # Using some wood as fuel\n\n# Now insert the 5 iron ore into the stone furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, new_furnace, quantity=5)  # Add the gathered iron ore into the furnace\n\n# Check the updated inventory after setting up the furnace\nprint(f\"Inventory after setting up the stone furnace: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory after setup\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check the updated status of the entities after setup", "summary_range": "[1-174]"}
