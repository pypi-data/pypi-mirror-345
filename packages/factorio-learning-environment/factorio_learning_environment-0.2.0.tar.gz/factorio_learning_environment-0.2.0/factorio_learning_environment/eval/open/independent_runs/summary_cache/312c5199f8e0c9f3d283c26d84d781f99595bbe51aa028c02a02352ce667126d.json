{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nThere are currently no structures placed on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable positions\n- Ensure that the chosen position for placing any entity, such as a Stone Furnace or Wooden Chest, is buildable. Verify the terrain and any existing restrictions before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities where resources are unavailable\n- Before placing a Furnace, make sure there is a coal supply available to fuel it. If coal is not available, the Furnace will not function as intended.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check that the tile is free of other entities or obstacles before placing a new entity like a Wooden Chest or Transport Belt. Attempting to place on an occupied tile will result in failure.\n\n### Errors when using extraction or placement without proximity\n- Move closer to the target area or entity where you want to place or extract items to ensure successful execution of the action.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for construction and placement. This will prevent unnecessary placement attempts when items are not available."}
