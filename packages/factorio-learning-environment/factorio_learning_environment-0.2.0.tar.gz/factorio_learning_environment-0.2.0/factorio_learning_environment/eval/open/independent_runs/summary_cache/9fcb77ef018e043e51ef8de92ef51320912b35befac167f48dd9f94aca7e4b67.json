{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) receiving coal from the drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items to transfer coal further.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) receiving iron ore from the drill.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) intended for smelting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items to transfer iron ore from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to the furnace.\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-8.5, -48.5) and (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, with one connected to a chest at (-13.5, -45.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chest in Mining Operations\n- Ensure that chests used in mining operations are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to operate efficiently. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and supply the required materials.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
