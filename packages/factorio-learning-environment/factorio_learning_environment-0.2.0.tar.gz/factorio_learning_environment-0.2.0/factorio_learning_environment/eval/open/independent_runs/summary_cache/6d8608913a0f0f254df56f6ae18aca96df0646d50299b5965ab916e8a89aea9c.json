{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with coal as fuel. It is currently working and has a warning about the output being blocked by an item on the ground.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) fueled by coal, successfully producing iron plates. The furnace is working with iron ore being inserted into it.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is not already occupied by another entity or object. Check the surroundings before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Furnace Setup Issues\n- Verify that the furnace setup is correct, including ensuring that the furnace has the necessary fuel and input materials to produce the desired output. Regularly check if the furnace is producing the expected items.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drills\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the mining drill. Clear any items blocking the output position to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
