{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) and (x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-3.5, y=26.0)\n- Steam engine at position (x=35.5, y=27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes placed at positions (x=-8.0, y=24.5) to (x=-5.0, y=24.5)\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with a burner inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (x=13.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) with a burner inserter at position (x=17.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chests at positions (x=8.5, y=-0.5), (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), and (x=20.5, y=-0.5)\n\n#### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a burner inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=8.5, y=1.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors When Inserting Items into Full Inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. This error occurred when trying to insert coal into a stone furnace and a boiler with full inventories.\n\n#### Errors When Connecting Pipes and Offshore Pumps\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected to the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Ensure there are no obstructions and that all connections are secure to allow fluid flow.\n\n#### Errors When Placing Pipes in Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing a pipe, check that the target tile is unoccupied. If there are existing objects, clear them first to avoid placement errors.\n\n#### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Steam\n- Double-check the connections between the boiler and the steam engine to ensure steam can flow freely. Check for any disconnected pipes or incorrect configurations.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be significantly improved."}
