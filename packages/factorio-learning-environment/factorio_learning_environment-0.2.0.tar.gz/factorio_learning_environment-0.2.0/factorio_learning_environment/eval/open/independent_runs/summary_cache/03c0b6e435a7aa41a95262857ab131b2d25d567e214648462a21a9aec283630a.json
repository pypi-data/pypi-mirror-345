{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (2.0, -63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (2.0, -63.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest at (2.5, -61.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (4.0, -63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates. Currently has 4 iron plates in its output inventory.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (6.0, -63.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, -61.5): Transfers items between the mining drill and furnaces. Currently waiting for space in the destination chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, -61.5): Contains 171 iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -61.5): Contains 800 iron ore and is full.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- **Issue**: Attempting to extract items from entities that do not contain the requested items or are not valid sources.\n  - **Solution**: Verify that the target entity contains the desired item before attempting extraction. Use the `inspect_entity` API to check the inventory of the entity.\n\n#### Errors due to full inventory\n- **Issue**: Attempting to pick up or extract items when the inventory is full.\n  - **Solution**: Ensure the inventory has space before attempting to pick up or extract items. Use the `inspect_inventory` API to check current inventory levels.\n\n#### Errors when placing or interacting with entities\n- **Issue**: Attempting to interact with entities that are not in a valid state (e.g., furnaces with no ingredients).\n  - **Solution**: Check the status of the entity before interacting with it. Use the `inspect_entity` API to verify its status and warnings.\n\n#### Errors when refueling entities\n- **Issue**: Refueling entities that are already adequately fueled.\n  - **Solution**: Check the fuel level of the entity before refueling. Use the `inspect_entity` API to verify fuel levels.\n\n#### Errors when extracting from invalid positions\n- **Issue**: Attempting to extract items from positions that do not contain valid entities.\n  - **Solution**: Ensure the target position contains a valid entity with the desired item before attempting extraction. Use the `inspect_entity` API to verify the entity and its contents."}
