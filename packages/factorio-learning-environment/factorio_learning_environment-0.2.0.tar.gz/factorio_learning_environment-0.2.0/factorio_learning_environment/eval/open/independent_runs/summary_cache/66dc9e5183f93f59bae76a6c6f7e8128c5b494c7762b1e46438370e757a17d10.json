{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5), connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest.\n  - **Transport Belt** starting from position (x=-12.5, y=-51.5) facilitating movement of materials.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) which moves iron plates from the furnace.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the furnace to other parts of the facility, with belts running from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) and from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5).\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent blockages. For instance, the chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) was full, causing the mining drill to stop working.\n\n### Errors due to blocked belts\n- Ensure that belts are not blocked to maintain continuous operation. The burner inserter at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) indicated a blockage in the furnace belt, which needs to be addressed to avoid production halts.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Handles inserting items into entities. Ensure that the source inventory has the required items before calling this function.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `mining_drill`: Represents the mining drill entity, used for inserting items like coal.\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary storing the current inventory state, including items like 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
