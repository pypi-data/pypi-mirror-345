{"content": "I notice the key issue: The mining drill at (-20.0, 22.0) has a warning \"waiting for space in destination as the output is full. Place a sink object at (-18.5, 21.5) to unblock.\"\n\nLet's fix this by placing a chest to collect the ore:\n\n```python\n# First place a wooden chest at the specified position\nchest = place_entity(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    position=Position(x=-18.5, y=21.5)\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at: {chest.position}\")\n\n# Now check the mining drill's status\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Mining drill status after adding chest: {drill.status}\")\n\n# Add more coal to ensure it's running\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added more fuel to drill\")\n\n# Final status check\nprint(f\"Final drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Chest inventory: {chest.inventory if chest else 'No chest found'}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Place a chest at the exact position where the drill needs to output\n2. Allow the drill to start working again\n3. Ensure it has enough fuel to continue operating\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this approach?", "summary_range": "[1-2634]"}
