{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity such as a Wooden Chest, Transport Belt, or Burner Inserter.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Verify that the destination tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity being moved, such as a Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. For example, ensure that a Stone Furnace exists at the given coordinates.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items, such as coal, before attempting to insert them into entities like drills.\n\n### Warnings about blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output from entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Warnings about missing ingredients\n- Make sure that the necessary ingredients are available for processing in entities like the Stone Furnace to avoid idle status."}
