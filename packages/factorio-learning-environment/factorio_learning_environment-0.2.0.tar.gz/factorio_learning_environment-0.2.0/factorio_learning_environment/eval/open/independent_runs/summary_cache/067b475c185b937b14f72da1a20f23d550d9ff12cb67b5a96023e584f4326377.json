{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to input items into the furnace\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) to store smelted items\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to transfer items into the chest\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=43.0, y=-86.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=43.5, y=-84.5) to store mined coal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) to transfer coal from the mining drill to the chest\n\n#### Additional Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=43.0, y=-79.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to input items into the furnace\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=44.5, y=-78.5) to output items from the furnace\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=43.5, y=-76.5) to store smelted items\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to existing structures\n- Ensure there is enough space to place an entity next to another structure. Increase spacing or change the direction to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n- Example: Placing a burner inserter next to a furnace at (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) failed due to insufficient spacing or direction issues.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to chests. Use an inserter to transfer items between belts and chests.\n- Example: Attempting to connect a transport belt directly to a wooden chest at (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) failed.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n- Example: Attempting to insert coal into a burner inserter at (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) failed due to insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts between invalid entities\n- Ensure the entities you are connecting with belts are valid and have a clear path for the belt to be placed.\n- Example: Attempting to connect belts between burner inserters at (x=-17.5, y=-50.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) failed due to an invalid path.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in blocked or invalid positions\n- Ensure the target position is not blocked by water, other entities, or invalid terrain before placing an entity.\n- Example: Placing a wooden chest next to a furnace at (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) failed due to a collision with the furnace.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills run out of fuel or storage is full\n- Ensure mining drills have sufficient fuel and that the output chest is not full to continue mining operations.\n- Example: Mining drills at (x=41.0, y=-86.0) and (x=43.0, y=-86.0) stopped due to lack of fuel and full output chests."}
