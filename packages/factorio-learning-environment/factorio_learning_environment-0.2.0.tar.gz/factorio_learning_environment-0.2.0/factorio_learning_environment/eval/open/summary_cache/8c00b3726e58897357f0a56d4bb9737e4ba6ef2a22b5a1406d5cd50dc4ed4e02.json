{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at approximately (16.0, 71.0) to (18.5, 75.5)\nConsists of the following interconnected entities forming a basic iron ore mining and smelting structure:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 72.5) collecting iron ore from the mining drill.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 73.5) feeding iron ore from the chest into the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 74.5) extracting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 75.5) collecting iron plates from the output inserter.\n- Additional wooden chest at position (15.5, 73.5) placed to receive iron ore from inserter feeding the furnace, improving logistics.\n- Coal has been inserted into the burner mining drill, furnace, and burner inserters to fuel their operation.\n- Small electric poles are present nearby (e.g., at (17.5, 71.5) and (19.5, 73.5)) to provide electricity coverage, though connection attempts between furnace and inserters failed.\n\nThis structure enables extraction of iron ore, smelting it into iron plates, and collection of output plates for further use.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Direction argument type error when placing entities\n- When placing entities that require a direction argument, ensure the direction parameter is passed as a Direction object, not as an integer or other type. Use the appropriate Direction enum or class instance.\n\n### Connection failure between entities for electric poles\n- When connecting entities with electric poles, verify that the entities exist and are correctly referenced before attempting connection.\n- Ensure the connection function handles nil or missing fields gracefully to avoid indexing errors.\n- Double-check entity positions and types to confirm compatibility for electric pole connections.\n\n### Extraction from empty or incorrect chests\n- Before extracting items from a chest, confirm the chest contains the requested item to avoid extraction failures.\n- Implement checks on chest inventory contents prior to extraction attempts.\n\n### Placement too far from player position\n- The player must be within a maximum placement distance (typically 10 units) to place an entity.\n- Move the player closer to the target position before placing entities if the distance is too large.\n\n### Fuel insertion and entity operation\n- Ensure burner entities (mining drills, inserters, furnaces) are supplied with fuel to operate.\n- Insert fuel items like coal into burner entities promptly after placement to avoid idle status.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
