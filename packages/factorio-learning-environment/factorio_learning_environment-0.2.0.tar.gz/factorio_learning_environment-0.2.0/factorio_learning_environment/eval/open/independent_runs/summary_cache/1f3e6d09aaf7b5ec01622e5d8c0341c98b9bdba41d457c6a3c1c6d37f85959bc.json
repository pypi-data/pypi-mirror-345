{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n\nThis structure is designed to extract iron ore and smelt it into iron plates. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into the stone furnace, which then processes the ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is unoccupied and valid. Check the surroundings before attempting to place an entity to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Verify that the target location for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is valid and unoccupied. Ensure that the new position is suitable for the entity being moved.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the intended entity, such as Stone Furnaces, at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Use accurate coordinates to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### Handling blocked outputs and lack of sink entities\n- Ensure that the output of entities like Burner Mining Drills is not blocked. Place appropriate sink entities, such as furnaces or chests, to accept the output and prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in processing entities\n- Ensure that processing entities like Stone Furnaces have the necessary ingredients to perform their functions. Regularly check and supply the required materials to maintain operation."}
