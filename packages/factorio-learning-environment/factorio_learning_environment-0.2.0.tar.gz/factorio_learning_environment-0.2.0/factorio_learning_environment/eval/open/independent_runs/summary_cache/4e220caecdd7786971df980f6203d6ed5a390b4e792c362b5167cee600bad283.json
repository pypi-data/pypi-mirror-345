{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\n- Connected by pipes and small electric poles\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position(-18.0, -49.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace at position(5.0, -73.0) producing iron plates\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5) with no research in progress\n\n### Assembling machine for Automation Science Pack at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5) set to create Automation Science Pack, but currently not receiving electricity and missing resources (copper-plate and iron-gear-wheel)\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- Pipe group for fluid system 42463 at position(-12.5, 21.5)\n- Pipe group for fluid system 42460 at position(-18.5, 16.5)\n- Additional empty pipe groups at positions(-8.5, 21.5), (-10.5, 22.5), and (-7.5, 23.5)\n\n### Electric poles\n- Multiple small electric poles at positions(-15.5, 19.5), (-16.5, 19.5), (-16.5, 18.5), (-16.5, 20.5), and (-19.5, 22.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required machines\n- Ensure you have the necessary crafting machines or furnaces available before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates require a furnace to smelt.\n\n### Errors when using assembling machines without power\n- Make sure that the assembling machine is connected to a power source to function properly.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities in the desired location.\n\n### Errors when attempting to research without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory to start research in the lab. For example, the lab requires automation science packs to begin research."}
