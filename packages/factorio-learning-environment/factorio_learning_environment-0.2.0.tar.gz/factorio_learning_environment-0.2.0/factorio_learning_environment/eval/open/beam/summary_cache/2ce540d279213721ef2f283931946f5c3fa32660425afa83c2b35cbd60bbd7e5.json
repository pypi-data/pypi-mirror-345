This discrepancy indicates that we may have lost track of our resources during the previous operations.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. We need to **gather more iron ore** from the nearest iron resource.\n2. After gathering enough iron ore, we can then proceed to smelt it into iron plates and craft the stone furnace.\n\nLet's go ahead and find some iron ore now.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to the nearest iron ore resource to gather more iron ore\niron_ore_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_ore_position)\n\n# Harvest more iron ore\nharvest_resource(iron_ore_position, quantity=5)  # Gather more iron ore\nprint(f\"Inventory after gathering more iron ore: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory after harvesting iron ore", "summary_range": "[1-188]"}
