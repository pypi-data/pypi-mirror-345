{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with a current inventory of iron ore and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5) connected to the furnace, responsible for inserting materials.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) for storing output products like stone bricks, wood, coal, and stone.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a warning of being out of fuel and a full chest at the drop position.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to other parts of the facility.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, facilitating the transport of materials across the map. Notably, there are issues with connectivity and normalization of paths.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to pick up or harvest items. Regularly clear out unnecessary items to avoid a full inventory.\n\n### Belt Connectivity Errors\n- Verify the path and connectivity of transport belts before attempting to connect them. Ensure that the path is valid and normalized to avoid connectivity issues.\n\n### Resource Availability Errors\n- Ensure that required resources, such as iron ore and wooden chests, are available in the inventory before attempting to use them. Gather necessary resources beforehand to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Placement and Distance Errors\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place entities. Ensure the player is within the maximum allowable distance to successfully place items.\n\n### Chest Capacity Errors\n- Regularly check the capacity of chests to prevent overfilling. Consider upgrading or adding additional storage to accommodate excess items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as transport belts, burner inserters, stone furnaces, coal, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n- `furnace_ingredients`: Dict[str, int] - Monitors the ingredients within the furnace, specifically iron ore and iron plates.\n\nThis report provides an overview of the existing structures, highlights common errors, and suggests improvements for efficient gameplay."}
