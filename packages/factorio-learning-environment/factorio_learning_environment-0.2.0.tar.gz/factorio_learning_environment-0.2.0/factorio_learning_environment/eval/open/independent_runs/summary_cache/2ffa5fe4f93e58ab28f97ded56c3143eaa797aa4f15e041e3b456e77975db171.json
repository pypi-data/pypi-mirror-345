{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has not successfully placed any entities or created any structures as indicated by the logs showing empty entity lists after each step.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity. The agent attempted to place various entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and inserters at multiple positions (e.g., x=0.0, y=0.0; x=50.0, y=50.0; x=200.0, y=200.0) but failed due to placement issues. Verify that the target location is clear before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors with position handling\n- When moving to a position, ensure that the position data is correctly formatted and accessible. Errors such as \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" and \"'Position' object is not callable\" indicate issues with how position data is being handled. Double-check the data types and access methods for position objects to prevent these errors.\n\n### Errors with BuildingBox size\n- Adjust the BuildingBox size or use multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if no viable placement is found. The error \"No viable place to put Prototype.WoodenChest near the centre position with this BuildingBox size found on the map\" suggests that the BuildingBox size is too large for the available space. Consider reducing the size or splitting the area into smaller sections for placement.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its ability to place entities and create structures effectively on the map."}
