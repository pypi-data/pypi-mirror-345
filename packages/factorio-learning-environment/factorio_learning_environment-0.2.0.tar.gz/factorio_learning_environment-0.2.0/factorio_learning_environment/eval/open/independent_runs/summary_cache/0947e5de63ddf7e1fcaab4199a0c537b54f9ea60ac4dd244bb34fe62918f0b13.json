{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, with positions ranging from (x=18.5, y=-3.5) to (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=22.5, y=-4.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for additional copper plate production\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) for transferring items from the chest\n\n### Fluid Transport System\nConsists of:\n- PipeGroup for water transport from position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) to (x=8.5, y=-7.5)\n- PipeGroup for steam transport from position (x=21.5, y=-10.5) to (x=20.5, y=-5.5)\n\n### Electrical Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles positioned from (x=16.5, y=-13.5) to (x=-2.5, y=1.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Fluid Connection\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly connected to allow water flow from the offshore pump to the boiler. Misplaced pipes can prevent the boiler from receiving water.\n\n### Errors in Power Supply to Lab\n- Verify that the lab is properly connected to the power network. Ensure there is a direct connection from the power source to the lab.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Supply to Boiler\n- Ensure the boiler is supplied with fuel to generate steam. Without fuel, the boiler will not function, and the steam engine will not produce electricity.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Operation\n- Ensure that the inserter has source items available to transfer. Without source items, the inserter will remain idle.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Furnaces without ingredients will not produce any output."}
