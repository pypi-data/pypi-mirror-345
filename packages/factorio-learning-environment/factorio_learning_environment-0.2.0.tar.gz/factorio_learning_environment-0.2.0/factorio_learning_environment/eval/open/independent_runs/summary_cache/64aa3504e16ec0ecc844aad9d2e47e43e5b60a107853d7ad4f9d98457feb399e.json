The furnace is currently working and has produced 98 iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position(41.0, -82.0)) which is currently working and has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position is full. The drill is set to drop resources at position(41.5, -80.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting fuel into the furnace without ingredients**\n  - Ensure that there are sufficient ingredients in the furnace's source inventory before inserting fuel. The furnace cannot operate without both fuel and ingredients.\n\n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**\n  - Regularly check and empty the wooden chest at position(41.5, -80.5) to allow the burner mining drill to continue mining. If the chest is full, the mining operation will halt.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `furnace_inventory`: dict\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict"}
