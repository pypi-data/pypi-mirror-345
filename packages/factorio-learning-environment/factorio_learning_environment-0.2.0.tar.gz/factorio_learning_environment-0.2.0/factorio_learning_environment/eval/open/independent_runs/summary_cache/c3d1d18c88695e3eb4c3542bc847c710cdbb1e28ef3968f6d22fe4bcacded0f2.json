{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, y=-48.0) and (-10.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, y=-50.0) with coal as fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, y=-48.5) and (-14.5, y=-48.5) used for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, y=-48.0) and (-10.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from furnaces to storage chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, y=-46.5) and (-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates to additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inserters\n- **Inserter Waiting for Source Items**: Ensure that the source of the inserter is adequately stocked with items to transfer. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory.\n- **Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination**: Ensure that the destination of the inserter has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred. Regularly monitor and clear the destination inventory to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- **No Coal to Insert from Inventory**: Before attempting to insert items, verify that the required items are available in your inventory. Regularly check and manage inventory levels to ensure availability of necessary resources."}
