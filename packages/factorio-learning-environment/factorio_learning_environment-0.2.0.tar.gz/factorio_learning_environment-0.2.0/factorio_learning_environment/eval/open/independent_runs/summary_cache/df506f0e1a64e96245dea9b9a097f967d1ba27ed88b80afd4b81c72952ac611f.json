{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a full output warning, indicating it is producing iron plates but cannot output them due to a full inventory.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) currently empty.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, indicating it is meant to transfer items between the chests.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) with no fuel, indicating it is not operational.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) waiting for source items.\n- A series of transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest, facilitating the movement of mined iron ore.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) with output blocked, indicating it cannot output mined copper ore due to a lack of space.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) currently empty.\n- A series of transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Additional Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Additional Chests and Inserters\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) containing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-20.5, y=-63.5) currently empty.\n- Burner Inserters at various positions waiting for source items, indicating they are meant to transfer items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. For example, the error when trying to get a wooden chest at position x=-23.5, y=-69.5 suggests the chest does not exist there.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is space available for entities like mining drills to output their products. Consider adding chests or belts to receive items from blocked entities.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like burner mining drills to keep them operational. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors due to full output in furnaces\n- Regularly empty the output of furnaces to prevent production stoppages. Consider using inserters and chests to automate the removal of finished products.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. Check the connections and supply lines to ensure items are available for inserters to transfer."}
