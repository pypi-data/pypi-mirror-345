{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (10.5, 0.5) with inserters that put copper plates into the machine.\n- Belt group connecting the assembling machine to other entities, though currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes and small electric poles.\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-11.5, 18.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (20.0, 20.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (19.5, 18.5) for storing copper ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure all electric entities, such as inserters and assembling machines, are connected to a power source and receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Verify that all required resources are available for the assembling machines to function properly. For example, the copper cable factory needs copper plates.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that boilers and other fuel-dependent entities have sufficient fuel to operate.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Make sure inserters have a clear path to pick up and drop items, and are powered to function correctly.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Input\n- Ensure that the steam engine is correctly connected to a boiler with sufficient water and fuel supply."}
