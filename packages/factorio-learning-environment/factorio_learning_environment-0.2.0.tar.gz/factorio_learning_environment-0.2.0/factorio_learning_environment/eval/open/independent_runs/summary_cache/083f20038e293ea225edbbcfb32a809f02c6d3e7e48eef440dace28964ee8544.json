{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a status of 'NO_FUEL' and warnings indicating it is out of fuel. It is connected to:\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) with a status of 'WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS', transferring items from a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) to another **Wooden Chest** at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=42.5, y=-83.5), and (x=46.5, y=-83.5) for storage, with inventories containing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) with a status of 'WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS', transferring items to a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a status of 'WORKING', processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Furnace** at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with a status of 'FULL_OUTPUT', indicating the furnace result is full.\n\n### Coal Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **BeltGroup** with inputs from a belt at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5) and outputs to a belt at position (x=43.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transferring coal along the belt system.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all Burner Mining Drills and Inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary to prevent operation halts.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities (e.g., chests or drills) have items available for inserters to pick up. Adjust the supply chain to ensure consistent item flow to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Output Management\n- Regularly clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from reaching a 'FULL_OUTPUT' status, which halts production. Consider using inserters to automatically transfer items from furnaces to storage chests or belts."}
