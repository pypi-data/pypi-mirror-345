{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5). This drill is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=-18.5, y=-48.5), (x=-16.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-13.5, y=-49.5) for storing iron ore. The chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) is a wooden chest.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=41.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), (x=44.5, y=-80.5), (x=45.5, y=-80.5), (x=47.5, y=-80.5), and (x=49.5, y=-80.5) for storing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) for additional coal storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=43.5, y=-80.5) and (x=41.5, y=-78.5) for transferring coal between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** and **Wooden Chests** positioned to store and manage the flow of iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from mining drills\n- Ensure that the output of the mining drill is not blocked by a full chest. Regularly check and clear the chest at the drop position to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when transferring iron ore to furnaces\n- Verify that there is iron ore available in your inventory before attempting to transfer it to furnaces. Keep track of inventory levels to avoid failed transfers.\n\n### Errors when transferring to non-existent entities\n- Double-check the positions of entities before attempting to transfer items. Ensure that the target entity exists at the specified position to prevent errors.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Maintain a sufficient stock of necessary items in your inventory to avoid failed operations due to lack of resources. Regularly monitor and replenish inventory as needed."}
