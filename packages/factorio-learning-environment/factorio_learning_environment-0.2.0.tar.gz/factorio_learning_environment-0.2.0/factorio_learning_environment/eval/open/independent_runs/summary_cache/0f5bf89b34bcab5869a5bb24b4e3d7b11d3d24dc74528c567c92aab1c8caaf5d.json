{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill at position(5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position(y1) to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions in the path when attempting to connect pipes. Check for any entities that may block the connection.\n\n### Errors when using electric connections\n- Verify that all electric poles are properly placed and connected to the electric network before attempting to power any entities. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target tile.\n\n### Errors related to fluid connections\n- Make sure that the offshore pump has a valid fluid connection and that there are no blockages in the fluid system. Check the status of connected pipes and ensure they are not empty."}
