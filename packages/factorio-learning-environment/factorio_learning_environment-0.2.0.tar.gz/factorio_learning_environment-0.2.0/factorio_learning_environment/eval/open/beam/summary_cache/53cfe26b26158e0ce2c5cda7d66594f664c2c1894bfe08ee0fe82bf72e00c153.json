This aligns with the previous observations that the furnace remains empty.\n\n### Current Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace is confirmed to be empty, with no items remaining after previous operations.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **1 piece of stone** remaining.\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is still in a **\"WORKING\"** state but does not recognize any materials for processing.\n- Since the furnace is empty, the next logical step is to ensure that it is properly set to accept Copper Ore for smelting.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Reinsert Stone**: Since I have **1 piece of stone**, I will insert it back into the furnace to meet the recipe requirement.\n2. **Insert Copper Ore**: After loading the stone, I will then insert the **1 piece of Copper Ore** to see if the furnace processes it correctly.\n3. **Monitor the Smelting Operation**: Observe closely to ensure that the furnace begins processing the Copper Ore.\n\nLet's proceed to load the stone back into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the remaining stone into the active furnace to enable smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Insert the 1 piece of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_stone_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading stone: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading stone: {overall_inventory_after_stone_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-352]"}
