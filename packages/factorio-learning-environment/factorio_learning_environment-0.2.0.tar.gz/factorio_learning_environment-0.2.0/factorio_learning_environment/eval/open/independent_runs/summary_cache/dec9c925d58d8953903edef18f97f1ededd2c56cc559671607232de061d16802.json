{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Status: Out of fuel, chest at drop position is full.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Status: Normal, inventory is empty or low on iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items, fueled with coal.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), Stone furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt, fueled with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly configured.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner mining drill and inserter to prevent interruptions in operations. Ensure a steady supply of coal in the inventory for refueling purposes.\n\n### Errors with Full Chest\n- Regularly monitor and empty the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. Verify that the inserter is functioning correctly to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace."}
