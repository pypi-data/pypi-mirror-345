{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is designed to extract and process iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It requires coal as fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- The furnace is not receiving iron ore due to incorrect inserter setup. Ensure that the inserter is properly aligned and fueled to transfer items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fueling\n- The burner inserter frequently runs out of fuel. Regularly check and refuel the inserter to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- The chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) is frequently full, preventing the mining drill from continuing its operation. Regularly extract items from the chest to free up space and ensure continuous mining.\n\n### General Placement and Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly positioned and aligned to interact with each other as intended. Misalignment can lead to operational inefficiencies or complete stoppage of processes."}
