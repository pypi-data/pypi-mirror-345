{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5), boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5), steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5), and connecting pipes. The system is now operational with the boiler containing 18 coal units. The steam engine is working and generating electricity for the factory. Small electric poles have been placed to create a power network from the steam engine to the factory area.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting at position(19.5, 74.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=19.5, y=74.5) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace (position x=20.0, y=78.0) for smelting iron plates\n- Inserter (position x=19.5, y=76.5) that moves ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter (position x=21.5, y=78.5) that takes iron plates from furnace\n- Small electric pole (position x=21.5, y=76.5) for power\n- Transport belt (position x=22.5, y=78.5) for moving iron plates\nThe system is waiting for resources to flow through the production line. The furnace currently has 40 coal units but no ore to smelt.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting at position(-49.5, 81.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5, y=81.5) extracting copper ore\n- Stone furnace (position x=-49.0, y=85.0) for smelting copper plates\n- Inserter (position x=-49.5, y=83.5) that moves ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter (position x=-47.5, y=85.5) that takes copper plates from furnace\n- Small electric pole (position x=-47.5, y=83.5) for power\nThe system is waiting for resources to flow through the production line. The furnace currently has 40 coal units but no ore to smelt.\n\n### Coal Mining at position(22.0, 18.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=22.0, y=18.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden chest (position x=22.5, y=19.5) for collecting coal, currently contains 685 coal\nThe drill is now working after being refueled.\n\n### Temporary Smelting Area at position(0.0, 140.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Temporary iron furnace (position x=0.0, y=140.0) with coal fuel (22 remaining)\n- Temporary copper furnace (position x=10.0, y=140.0) with coal fuel (31 remaining)\nBoth furnaces have been used for manual smelting of iron and copper ore.\n\n### Iron Gear Production at position(0.5, 150.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=0.5, y=150.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Input chest (position x=-3.5, y=150.5) for iron plates, currently contains 6 iron plates\n- Input inserter (position x=-2.5, y=150.5) that moves iron from chest to belt\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n- Input inserter (position x=-1.5, y=149.5) that moves iron from belt to assembler\n- Output inserter (position x=2.5, y=150.5) that takes gears from assembler to belt\n- Transport belt (position x=3.5, y=150.5) for moving gears\nThe system is experiencing an item ingredient shortage, waiting for iron plates to be moved from the chest to the assembler.\n\n### Science Pack Production at position(10.5, 150.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=10.5, y=150.5) set to craft automation science packs\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n- Input inserter (position x=10.5, y=147.5) for materials\n- Output inserter (position x=12.5, y=150.5) that takes"}
