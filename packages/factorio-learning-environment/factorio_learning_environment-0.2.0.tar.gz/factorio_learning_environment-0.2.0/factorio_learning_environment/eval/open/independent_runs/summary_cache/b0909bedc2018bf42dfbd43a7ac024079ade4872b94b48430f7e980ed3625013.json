{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore, currently contains 494 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It has been repositioned and aligned multiple times to ensure proper transfer.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment can cause the furnace not to receive the necessary ingredients for smelting.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items such as coal into an entity, verify that you have the required items in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Regularly check the setup of inserters and ensure they are operational and correctly configured to transfer items to the furnace. This will prevent the furnace from running without ingredients and improve production efficiency."}
