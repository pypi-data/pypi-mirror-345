Ensure the connection routine verifies the existence of a pipe group with the correct and currently active fluid_system (such as 101870) before attempting a connection.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Attribute Usage:\n  - Use only supported inventory attributes when accessing or modifying inventory items to avoid attribute errors.\n\n\u2022 Consistency in Connection Parameters:\n  - Verify that fluid_system identifiers and connection parameters match the updated map configuration to prevent mismatches during pipe group lookups."}
