{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two Stone Furnaces at positions (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.0, 1.0) for inserting iron ore into the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5) for storing produced iron plates.\n\n### Coal Harvesting Setup\n- No specific structures are detailed, but coal is consistently harvested and used to refuel furnaces and inserters.\n\n### Belt System\n- Two BeltGroups are present:\n  - BeltGroup 1: Inputs from Belt (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), outputs to Belt (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n  - BeltGroup 2: Inputs from Belt (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), outputs to Belt (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors in accessing entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. For example, the error \"Could not get Prototype.BurnerInserter at position x=4.5 y=1.5\" suggests that there is no burner inserter at that location. Double-check the position and ensure the entity is present before attempting to access it."}
