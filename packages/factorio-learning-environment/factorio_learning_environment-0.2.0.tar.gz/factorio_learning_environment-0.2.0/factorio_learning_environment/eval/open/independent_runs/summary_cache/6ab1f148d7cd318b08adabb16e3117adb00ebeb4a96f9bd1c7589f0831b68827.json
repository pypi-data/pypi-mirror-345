{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0): Extracts coal from the resource patch.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (41.5, -80.5): Transports coal from the drill to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5): Stores extracted coal.\n\n#### Inserter Setup at Position (43.5, -79.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -79.5): Transfers items between the chest and other structures.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (43.5, -80.5): Connects the inserter to the chest.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0): Used for smelting ores into plates. Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before placing entities like transport belts, chests, or mining drills. Use `clear_entity` or manually remove blocking entities before placement.\n\n#### Errors when inspecting or interacting with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. Use `get_entity` to confirm the entity's presence.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to existing ones\n- When placing entities like inserters next to other structures, ensure the spacing and direction are correct. Increase spacing or adjust the reference position if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when placing transport belts in blocked areas\n- Clear all blocking entities (e.g., other belts, chests) along the path before placing transport belts. Use `clear_entity` to remove obstructions.\n\n#### Errors when refueling or operating entities\n- Ensure entities like burner mining drills and inserters have sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) to operate. Refuel them manually if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have the required ingredients (e.g., ores) and fuel to operate. Transport belts and inserters should be properly connected to supply materials."}
