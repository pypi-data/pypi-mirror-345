{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a current inventory of 0 ingredients to smelt and a result inventory of 76 iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a current fuel inventory and a status of working. It has a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5) and is connected to a wooden chest at that position.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with an inventory containing 342 iron ore, but is full and cannot accept more resources.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when refueling Burner Mining Drill**: Ensure that the drill has enough fuel and that the drop position chest is not full before attempting to refuel.\n- **Errors when feeding Stone Furnace**: Make sure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The current status indicates no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Errors when harvesting**: Avoid harvesting from positions where resources are not available or are already depleted.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: tuple (float, float)\n  - `stone_furnace_position`: tuple (float, float)"}
