{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=41.5, y=-83.5), and (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the storage chests\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=10.5, y=1.5) for storing copper plates\n\n### Transport and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), and (x=8.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=7.5, y=0.5), (x=12.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5) for storing various items\n- BeltGroup connecting the inserters and chests for item transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Removing Chests\n- Ensure that the correct method is used to remove a chest. The error indicates that the 'Chest' object is not callable, suggesting a misuse of the API.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. Check the supply chain to ensure that items are being delivered to the inserters.\n\n### NameError with BurnerInserter\n- Ensure that the correct class name is used when checking the entity type. The error suggests that 'BurnerInserter' is not defined, and possible correct names are provided.\n\n### Errors with Entity Retrieval\n- Ensure that the correct entity type and position are specified when retrieving entities. The error indicates that no entity of type wooden-chest was found at the specified position."}
