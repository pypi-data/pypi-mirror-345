{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5) \n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0) \n- Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill at position(5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position(y1) to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that there is no blockage in the area where pipes are being connected. Check for existing entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Confirm that all power sources are properly connected to the entities that require power. Check the status of electric poles and their connections to ensure they are functioning correctly."}
