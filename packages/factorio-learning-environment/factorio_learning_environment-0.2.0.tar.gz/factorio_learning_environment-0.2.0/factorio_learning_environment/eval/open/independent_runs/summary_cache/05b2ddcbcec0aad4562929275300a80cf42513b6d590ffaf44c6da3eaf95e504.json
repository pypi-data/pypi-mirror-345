{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for mining iron ore and is currently fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores the mined iron ore, currently containing 484 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is aligned to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace. It is fueled with coal but is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it is not receiving iron ore due to an issue with the inserter setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and operational to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check and adjust the inserter's position and alignment to ensure it is functioning as intended.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the necessary items are available in your inventory. For example, ensure you have enough coal before trying to refuel machines or inserters.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Regularly check the setup and operation of inserters feeding into the furnace to ensure that they are correctly transferring the required ingredients. Make necessary adjustments to the inserter's position or alignment if the furnace is not receiving materials."}
