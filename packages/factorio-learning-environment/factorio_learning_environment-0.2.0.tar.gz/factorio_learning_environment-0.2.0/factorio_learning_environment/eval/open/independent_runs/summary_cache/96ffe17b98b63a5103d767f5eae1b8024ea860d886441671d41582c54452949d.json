{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0)**: Fueled by coal, currently working with an inventory of 79 iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0)**: Fueled by coal, currently working with an inventory of 79 iron plates.\n- **Chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5)**: Used for coal storage, each containing 5 units of coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)**: Fueled by coal, currently working with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5)**: Fueled by coal, waiting for space in the destination with a warning about the full chest.\n- **Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5) and (42.5, -83.5)**: The chest at (40.5, -83.5) is full with 800 units of coal, and the chest at (42.5, -83.5) contains 10 units of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory in Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests to prevent mining and inserter operations from halting due to full inventory. Specifically, the chest at (40.5, -83.5) is full, which is causing the mining drill and inserter to issue warnings.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **Inventory**: A dictionary representing the current inventory of the agent, including items such as 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
