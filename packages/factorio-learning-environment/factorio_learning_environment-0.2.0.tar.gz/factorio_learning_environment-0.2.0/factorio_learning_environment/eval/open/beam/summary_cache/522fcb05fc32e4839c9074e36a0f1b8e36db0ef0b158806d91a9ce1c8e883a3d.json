This ongoing situation confirms that a reset or intervention is necessary to restore functionality.\n\nTo avoid further frustration, it would be beneficial to take the following steps:\n\n1. **Reset the Environment**: Initiate a reset of the FactoryEnv to clear any issues that may be causing the unresponsiveness.\n2. **Check for Errors**: After the reset, check for any error messages or logs that might indicate what went wrong during previous interactions.\n3. **Re-establish Connection**: Once the environment is reset, attempt to re-establish a connection to ensure that interactions can proceed smoothly.\n\nI appreciate your patience throughout this process.
