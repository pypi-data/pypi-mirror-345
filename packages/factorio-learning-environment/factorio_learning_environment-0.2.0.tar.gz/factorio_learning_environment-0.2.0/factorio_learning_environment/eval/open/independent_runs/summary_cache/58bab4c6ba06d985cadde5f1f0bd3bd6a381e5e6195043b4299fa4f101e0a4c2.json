{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and a Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Additional Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) for further processing of iron ore.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) for moving items between entities.\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Extraction Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to an Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) and a Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0).\n- Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) for moving items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the inserters have access to the source items they need to move. Check that the source entities are not empty or blocked.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests."}
