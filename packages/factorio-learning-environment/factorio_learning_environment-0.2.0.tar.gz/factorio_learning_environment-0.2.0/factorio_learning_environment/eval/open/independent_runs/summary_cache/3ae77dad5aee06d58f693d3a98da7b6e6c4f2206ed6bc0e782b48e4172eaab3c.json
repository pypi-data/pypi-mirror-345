{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt' and status 'NO_INGREDIENTS'.\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) with status 'NO_POWER', connected to the stone furnace.\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) with warnings 'inserter waiting for source items', 'not receiving electricity', and status 'NO_POWER'.\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) and another at position (18.5, 0.5) for storage.\n\n### Power Infrastructure\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-12.5, y=19.5) and another at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5) with status 'EMPTY'.\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=9.5, y=1.5), and (x=15.5, y=2.5), but with voltage 0, indicating no power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Power Infrastructure Setup\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Verify the positions and connectivity of each pipe.\n- Confirm that the steam engine is correctly placed and connected to the power grid. Double-check the position to ensure it matches the intended setup.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Power Connection\n- Verify that all inserters are within range of a powered electric pole. Ensure that the electric poles are connected and have sufficient power to supply the inserters.\n\n### Errors in Mining Drill Placement\n- Before placing a mining drill, ensure the target position is suitable and unoccupied. Check for any obstructions or existing entities at the intended location."}
