{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Many placement attempts failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. The error \"name 'new_chest' is not defined\" indicates an attempt to use an undefined variable.\n\n### Errors with incorrect data types\n- When using functions or methods, ensure that the correct data types are being passed. Errors like \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" suggest incorrect data types are being used.\n\n### Errors with object usage\n- Verify that objects are being used correctly. Errors like \"'Position' object is not callable\" indicate misuse of objects, possibly treating an object as a function.\n\n### Errors with building box size\n- When using building boxes, ensure that the size is appropriate for the available space. The error regarding no viable place for a Wooden Chest suggests the building box size was too large for the available area. Consider using smaller building boxes or adjusting the size accordingly."}
