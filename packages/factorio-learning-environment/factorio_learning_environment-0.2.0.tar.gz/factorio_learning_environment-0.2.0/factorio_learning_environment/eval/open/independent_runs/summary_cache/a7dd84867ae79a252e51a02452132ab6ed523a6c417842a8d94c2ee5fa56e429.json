{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nComplex system for mining and transporting coal consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) storing coal from mining drill\n- Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) as intermediate storage\n- Burner inserter (x=42.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT, moving coal from wooden chest to belt\n- Transport belt (x=43.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT\n\n### Iron Smelting Area (around x=45-50, y=-81)\nSmelting setup consisting of:\n- Stone furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n- Stone furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0) \n- Wooden chest (x=49.5, y=-80.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Main belt group from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5 at x=42.5\n- Additional belt at x=43.5, y=-80.5 facing RIGHT\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other objects\n- Multiple attempts to place burner-inserter failed due to existing objects at locations (44.0, -81.0), (44.0, -80.5), and (44.5, -80.5)\n\n2. Transport Belt Issues\n- Ensure transport belts are properly connected and not blocked before attempting to extract items\n- Belt blockage is preventing mining operations (warning observed on burner inserter at x=42.5, y=-80.5)\n\n3. Space Management\n- Multiple \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" errors indicate need for better output management\n- Consider adding more storage or improving item flow when systems back up\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the world\n  Success: When target location is clear\n  Failure: When location is occupied by other entities\n\n- extract_item(): Extracts items from entities\n  Success: When target entity contains specified items\n  Failure: When items not found or entity invalid\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- belt_right: TransportBelt\n- coal_from_belt: Integer"}
