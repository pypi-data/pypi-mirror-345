Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments like \u201cradius\u201d or extra positional arguments.\n\u2022 Lab Placement Validation\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that a Lab exists in the inventory before attempting placement to prevent placement failures.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Failures\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron\u2011gear\u2011wheel, electronic\u2011circuit, and copper\u2011cable) are available in sufficient quantities prior to crafting. Ensure that prerequisite production steps (like smelting and related crafting of base items) are completed.\n\u2022 Handling Non\u2010Iterable Returns\n\u2003\u2013 When retrieving entities (e.g. labs), use fallback checks so that a None return value is treated as an empty list rather than leading to iteration errors."}
