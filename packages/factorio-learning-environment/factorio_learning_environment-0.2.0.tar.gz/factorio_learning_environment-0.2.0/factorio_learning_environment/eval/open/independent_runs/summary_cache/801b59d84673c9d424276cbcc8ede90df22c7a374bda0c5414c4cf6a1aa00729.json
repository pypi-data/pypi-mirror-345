{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for power distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and another at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=5.5)\n- Inserters at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5) and Position (x=9.5, y=5.5) for item movement\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnace and chest\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for copper cable production\n- Inserters and Small Electric Poles for item movement and power distribution\n- BeltGroup for transporting materials to the assembling machine\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chests at various positions for storage\n- Inserters and Transport Belts for item movement\n- BeltGroup for efficient item transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup object is correctly defined with all necessary attributes before accessing them. The 'direction' attribute is missing in the BeltGroup object.\n\n### Errors with Electricity and Resource Supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a power source. Check that the electricity network is complete and functional.\n- Verify that all production entities have the necessary input resources to function. For example, ensure that boilers have fuel and assembling machines have the required ingredients.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Belts\n- Ensure inserters are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items as intended. Verify that they are powered and have a clear path to their source and destination.\n- Check that transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to facilitate the intended flow of items.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be improved significantly."}
