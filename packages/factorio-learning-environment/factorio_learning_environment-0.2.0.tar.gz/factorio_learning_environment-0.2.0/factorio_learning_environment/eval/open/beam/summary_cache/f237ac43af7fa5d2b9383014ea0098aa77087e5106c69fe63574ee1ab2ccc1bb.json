Monitor both furnaces as they continue processing their respective iron ore.\n2. If necessary, gather more iron ore to maintain production once they finish their current batches.\n\nLet\u2019s wait briefly to see how many iron plates are produced by both furnaces after a short pause.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the furnaces to process their iron ore\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration if needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-110]"}
