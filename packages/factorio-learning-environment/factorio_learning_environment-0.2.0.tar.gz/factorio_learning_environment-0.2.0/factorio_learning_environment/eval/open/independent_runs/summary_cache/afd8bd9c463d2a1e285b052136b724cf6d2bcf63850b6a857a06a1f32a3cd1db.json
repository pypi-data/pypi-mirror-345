{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nA complex production line for converting iron ore to iron plates, consisting of:\n\nInput Section:\n- 4 wooden chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) serving as input storage\n- 4 burner inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) facing DOWN to move materials from input chests to furnaces\n\nProcessing Section:\n- 4 stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore\n\nOutput Section:\n- 4 wooden chests at positions (-2.5, 0.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5) serving as output storage\n- 5 burner inserters for output handling:\n  - At (-1.5, 0.5) facing LEFT\n  - At (1.5, 1.5) facing RIGHT\n  - At (3.5, 1.5) facing RIGHT\n  - At (5.5, 1.5) facing RIGHT\n  These inserters move processed iron plates from furnaces to output chests\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Output Blocking Issues\n- Multiple inserters are showing \"output blocked by item on the ground\" warnings\n- Ensure proper clearance and valid drop locations for inserters\n- Verify that destination entities can accept the items being moved\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Some furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Ensure consistent supply of both fuel (coal) and raw materials (iron ore) to all furnaces\n- Monitor input chest resource levels to maintain continuous production\n\n### Inserter Waiting States\n- Multiple inserters are in \"waiting for source items\" state\n- Ensure proper material flow through the production line\n- Check if input resources are being distributed evenly across the system\n\n### Space Management\n- Several inserters showing \"waiting for space in destination\" warnings\n- Ensure output chests have sufficient space and are being emptied regularly\n- Consider adding more storage capacity or improving output logistics"}
