{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided logs:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at position(x=35-41, y=-85 to -87)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (37.0,-85.0), (39.0,-85.0), and (41.0,-86.0)\n- Wooden chests at positions (34.5,-86.5), (36.5,-86.5), (40.5,-87.5), and (39.5,-83.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (35.5,-86.5) and (35.5,-85.5)\n\n### Iron/Copper Ore Mining and Smelting at position(x=-28, y=-61)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-28.0,-61.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (-27.0,-58.0)\n- Wooden chests at positions (-27.5,-59.5) and (-24.5,-58.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (-26.5,-59.5) and (-25.5,-58.5)\n- Additional furnaces at positions (-23.0,-58.0), (-21.0,-58.0)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(x=-10 to -6, y=-59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (-10.0,-59.0), (-8.0,-59.0), and (-6.0,-59.0)\n- Wooden chests at positions (-9.5,-57.5), (-7.5,-57.5), (-5.5,-57.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (-6.5,-57.5), (-7.5,-56.5), (-5.5,-56.5), (-4.5,-57.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting the components\n\n### Smelting Array at position(x=0 to 6, y=0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Four stone furnaces at positions (0.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), (4.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0)\n- Wooden chests at positions (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), (6.5,2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for input/output at positions (0.5,1.5), (2.5,1.5), (4.5,1.5), (6.5,1.5)\n- Transport belt system for item movement\n\n### Power Generation System at position(x=-3.5 to 4.5, y=17-27)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (4.5,20.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5,22.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-3.5,27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting components\n- Electric poles extending from (7.5,20.5) to (11.5,20.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Extraction errors\n- Must be within reach of the target chest when attempting to extract items\n- Verify the chest contains the requested items before attempting extraction\n\n### Entity placement optimization\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - implement a fuel distribution system\n- Several inserters are waiting for source items - ensure proper supply chain connectivity\n\n### Fluid system warnings\n- Steam engine has no input liquid - ensure proper pipe connections and fluid flow\n- Boiler is out of fuel - implement automated fuel feeding system\n\n### Production flow issues\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" - establish consistent ore supply\n- Some inserters are blocked due to full output chests - implement better output management"}
