The stone furnace at position (x = -14, y = -49) was full, preventing the insertion of additional coal. Consider managing inventory levels or redistributing items to avoid such issues.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\nNo utility functions or important variables have been defined or invoked in the provided logs."}
