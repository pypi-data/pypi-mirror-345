{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a small iron plate production line:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore from the nearby iron ore patch.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates output from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n\nThis structure is designed to automate iron ore extraction, smelting, and collection of iron plates in one compact area.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters adjacent to occupied tiles\n- When placing an inserter next to another entity (e.g., wooden chest), ensure the target tile is free. If placement fails due to an occupied tile, try increasing spacing, changing the direction of placement, or adjusting the reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Fuel management errors causing stoppages\n- Multiple entities (burner mining drill, furnace, inserters) ran out of fuel causing them to stop working.\n- Always monitor fuel levels and insert fuel into all burner-type entities to maintain continuous operation.\n- Automate coal supply or manually insert fuel regularly to prevent downtime.\n\n### Inserter waiting states due to missing source or destination items\n- Inserters showed statuses like WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS or WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION.\n- Ensure upstream entities have sufficient input items and downstream entities have space to receive output.\n- Check inventories and supply chains to avoid bottlenecks or empty inventories causing inserters to stall.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
