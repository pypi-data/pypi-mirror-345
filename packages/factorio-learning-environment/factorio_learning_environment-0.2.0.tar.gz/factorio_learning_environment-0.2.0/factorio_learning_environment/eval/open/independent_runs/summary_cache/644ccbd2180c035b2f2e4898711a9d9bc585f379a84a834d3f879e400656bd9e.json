{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) facing down, mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -48.5) transferring ore from drill to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) for smelting iron ore into plates\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if target position is already occupied by another entity before placing\n- When placing inserters next to entities, ensure proper spacing and no overlapping positions\n- Consider using different directions or increasing spacing between entities if placement fails\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting to insert into entities\n- Ensure sufficient fuel (coal) is available before trying to fuel entities\n\n### Errors with entity dimensions and placement\n- Account for entity dimensions (width/height) when calculating placement positions\n- Cannot use ModelPrivateAttr directly for calculations - need to access actual width/height values\n\n### Errors with entity outputs being blocked\n- Ensure there is a valid destination entity that can accept outputs\n- Check if output tile is blocked by items on ground\n- Verify inserters and destination entities are properly aligned and positioned"}
