{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-73.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt' and a result inventory containing copper plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt' and a result inventory containing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt' and an empty result inventory.\n- Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a small electric pole and a wooden chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=7.5, y=-61.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (x=6.5, y=-59.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located at an unspecified position, not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-45.5, y=-123.5) with pipes at (x=-45.5, y=-123.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-44.5, y=-122.5) with pipes at (x=-44.5, y=-122.5) and (x=-44.5, y=-121.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-44.5, y=-119.5) with pipes at (x=-44.5, y=-119.5).\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions, all with status EMPTY.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, voltage is 0, indicating no power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using get_entity API\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity type matches the expected type.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Verify that all electrical entities are connected to a power source and that the electricity network is operational. Ensure that power poles are correctly placed and connected to a power source.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Confirm that pipes are placed correctly and form a continuous network. Check for any gaps or misaligned pipes that might prevent fluid flow."}
