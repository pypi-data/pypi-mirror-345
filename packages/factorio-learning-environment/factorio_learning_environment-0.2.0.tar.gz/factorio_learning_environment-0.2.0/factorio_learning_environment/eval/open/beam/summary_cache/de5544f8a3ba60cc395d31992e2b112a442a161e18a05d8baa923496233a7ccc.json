{"content": "It seems that the furnace is actively smelting iron ore, but we still don't have enough iron plates to craft the Boiler. The furnace currently has 2 iron plates, and we need at least 4. Let's ensure the furnace continues to smelt and check the status again after a short period.\n\n### Steps to Follow:\n\n1. **Monitor Furnace Progress:**\n   - The furnace is working, and it has 15 iron ore in its source. Let's allow it some more time to smelt additional iron plates.\n\n2. **Wait for Smelting to Complete:**\n   - Use a `sleep` function to give the furnace time to process the iron ore into iron plates. This will ensure that the smelting process has time to complete.\n\n3. **Recheck Inventory:**\n   - After waiting, inspect the inventory again to see if we have accumulated enough iron plates.\n\n4. **Craft the Boiler:**\n   - If the inventory now contains at least 4 iron plates, proceed to craft the Boiler.\n\n5. **Proceed with Setup:**\n   - Once the Boiler is crafted, continue with the setup of the power infrastructure as previously outlined.\n\nHere is the code to execute these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 2: Wait for smelting to complete\nsleep(10)  # Wait for 10 seconds to allow smelting to progress\n\n# Step 3: Recheck inventory for iron plates\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Updated Inventory after waiting:\", inventory)\n\n# Step 4: Attempt to craft the Boiler if enough iron plates are available\nif inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 4:\n    boiler_crafted = craft_item(Prototype.Boiler, 1)\n    if boiler_crafted:\n        print(f\"Successfully crafted {boiler_crafted} Boiler.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Still insufficient iron plates to craft a Boiler.\")\n\n# Step 5: Verify entities on the map\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Ensure the furnace is not overloaded with fuel, as indicated by the warning \"furnace fuel source is full.\" This won't affect smelting but is good to manage resources efficiently.\n- Regularly check the furnace status and inventory to ensure continuous smelting.\n- Once the Boiler is crafted, follow the previous steps to place it and connect it to the Offshore Pump and Steam Engine.", "summary_range": "[1-342]"}
