{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5), not connected.\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0), not connected.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), working.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Pipe at position (-8.5, 23.5).\n- Underground Pipe Start at position (-7.5, 23.5).\n- Multiple PipeGroups connecting various positions, with some sections not connected or requiring adjustment.\n\n### Power Network\n- Connected Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) to power network with poles.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5), not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5), empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes or underground pipes is clear of other entities or unplaceable terrain like water. Adjust the placement strategy if necessary.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to the pipe network to allow fluid flow. Check for any missing connections or misplaced pipes.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a power source. Ensure that the power poles are properly placed and connected to provide electricity to the inserters.\n\n### Repeated Placement Errors\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target position is unoccupied. Remove any existing entities at the target position before attempting to place a new one.\n\n### General Connectivity\n- Regularly check the status of all entities to ensure they are connected and functioning as expected. Address any warnings or errors promptly to maintain efficient operation."}
