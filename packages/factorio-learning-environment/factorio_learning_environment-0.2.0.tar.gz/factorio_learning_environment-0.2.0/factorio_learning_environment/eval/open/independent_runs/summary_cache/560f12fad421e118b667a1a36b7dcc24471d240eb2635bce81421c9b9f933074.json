{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0): Extracts iron ore from the ground. It is currently working and has a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5).\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates. It is currently not operational due to a lack of ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid positions\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place any new entity, such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied or invalid positions\n- Verify that the destination is clear and valid before moving entities like Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it, as seen with the Stone Furnace retrieval error at Position (-16.5, -52.5).\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in production\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for processing in structures like the Stone Furnace to prevent production halts."}
