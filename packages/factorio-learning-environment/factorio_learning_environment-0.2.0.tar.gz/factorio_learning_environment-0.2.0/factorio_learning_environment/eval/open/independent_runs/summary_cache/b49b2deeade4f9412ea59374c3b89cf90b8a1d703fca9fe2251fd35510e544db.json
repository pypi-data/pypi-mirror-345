{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, with pipes at positions such as (-47.5, -122.5), (-46.5, -121.0), and (-43.5, -118.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (-44.5, -119.5), (-43.5, -117.5), (-39.5, -116.5), and (-39.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper plates in the furnace result inventory\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with iron plates in the furnace result inventory\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to small electric poles and a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chests at positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5)\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, but currently without power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing entity at the target location before placing a pipe. Remove any existing entities if necessary.\n- Verify that the target location is suitable for pipe placement and is not obstructed by other objects.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Ensure the steam engine is connected to a power network and has a sufficient input of liquid to generate power. Check connections and fluid availability.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement and Removal\n- Double-check the intended positions for pipe placement to avoid removing and replacing pipes unnecessarily. This can prevent errors related to existing entities at target locations."}
