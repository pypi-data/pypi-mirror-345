Repeated errors at positions (-6.5, 24.5) and (-7.5, 23.5) indicate pre-existing entities blocking placement.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Inventory for Fluid Connection\n\u2003- Verify that the inventory holds the full required number of pipes before merging pipe chains. A merge failed because 97 pipes were needed while only 47 were available.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Sub-Ingredient Limitations\n\u2003- Confirm that all necessary sub-ingredients (e.g. iron plates) are available via proper smelting or through a functioning crafting machine. A failure to produce additional pipes occurred due to an iron-plate shortage.\n\n\u2022 Intermediate PipeGroup Connection Failures\n\u2003- Validate the existence and proximity of candidate PipeGroups when attempting fluid network connections. Previous attempts using fluid_system IDs 17258, 17400, and 17542 near (-1.5, 17.5) were aborted due to missing or misaligned candidates.\n\n\u2022 Repeated Fluid Connection Candidate Errors\n\u2003- Before using an intermediate PipeGroup, verify that a candidate exists at (-1.5, 17.5) with the specified fluid_system ID. Attempts with fluid_system IDs 17684, 17826, 17968, 18110, 18252, 18394, 18536, and 18678 all failed. Cross-check candidate availability and fluid_system alignment to avoid these repeated errors.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 get_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any  \n\u2003Retrieves an entity of the specified type at the given position.
