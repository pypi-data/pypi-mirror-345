{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Setup at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-13.5, 20.0)\n- Small electric pole at position (-15.5, 18.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (-15.5, 19.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (-15.5, 21.5)\n- Pipe connections to offshore pump and other pipes\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe connections to the boiler and other pipes\n\n### Lab at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x) which is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Assembling Machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5)\n- Multiple small electric poles nearby which are currently obstructed and not providing power.\n\n### Pipe Groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup for fluid system 50954 with pipes connecting the offshore pump and boiler.\n- PipeGroup for fluid system 50956 and 50957 at position (-4.5, 21.5) and (-4.5, 23.5) respectively.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with various small electric poles connected to the lab and assembling machine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure there is no obstruction in the target area before attempting to place an electric pole. Check for existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are within range and that there are no obstructions in between. If an entity is not receiving power, ensure that it is connected to a power source correctly.\n\n### Errors related to lab and assembling machine power\n- Ensure that the lab and assembling machine are placed within the range of an electric pole. If they are too far, move them closer to an available power source.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Always confirm that the position you are trying to place an entity is valid and not occupied by another entity."}
