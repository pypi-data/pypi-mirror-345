{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (52.0, -79.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (53.5, -79.5) (out of fuel)\n- Wooden chest at position (54.5, -79.5) containing iron plates\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Operation at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) (out of fuel)\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) (waiting for source items)\n- Burner inserter at position (-12.5, -48.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Storage Area at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (0.5, 0.5) containing various items\n- Wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing various items\n- Wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) containing coal\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) containing coal\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, 0.5) containing coal and iron ore\n- Wooden chest at position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining Drill Not Working\n- Ensure the burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) has sufficient fuel to operate. Add coal to the drill's fuel inventory.\n- Check if the chest at the drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Empty the chest to allow the drill to continue mining.\n\n#### Burner Inserter Out of Fuel\n- The burner inserter at position (53.5, -79.5) is out of fuel. Add coal to its fuel inventory to resume operation.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- The burner inserters at positions (-13.5, -48.5) and (-12.5, -48.5) are waiting for source items. Ensure that the mining drill is operational and that there are items to transfer.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- None assigned yet."}
