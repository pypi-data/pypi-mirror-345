{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Mining and Collection Setup at Position (41.0, -86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -86.0): Extracts coal and outputs to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (41.5, -84.5): Transports coal from the drill to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -83.5): Collects coal from the transport belt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5): Moves coal from the transport belt into the chest.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients for smelting.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before placing entities like transport belts, chests, or inserters. Repeated attempts to place entities on occupied tiles caused multiple errors.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to place entities without sufficient inventory\n- Verify that the required item (e.g., wooden chest) is in the inventory before attempting to place it. Crafting the item beforehand can prevent this issue.\n\n#### Errors when retrieving entities at incorrect positions\n- Double-check the position of entities (e.g., burner mining drills or inserters) before attempting to interact with them. Use accurate coordinates to avoid errors.\n\n#### Errors when inspecting non-existent entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to inspect its inventory or status. Clearing or replacing entities may require rechecking their positions.\n\n#### Errors due to overlapping or conflicting entity placements\n- Plan entity placements carefully to avoid overlapping or conflicting positions. Clear existing entities before placing new ones in the same location.\n\n#### Errors when refueling or interacting with entities\n- Ensure the entity (e.g., burner mining drill or inserter) is correctly placed and accessible before attempting to refuel or interact with it."}
