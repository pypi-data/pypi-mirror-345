Verify the chest's inventory before extraction attempts.\n\n### Errors when transferring iron ore to furnaces\n- Make sure the furnaces have the necessary ingredients before attempting to transfer materials. Check that the furnaces are not full or lacking fuel.\n\n### Errors when moving items from mining drill drop positions\n- Verify that the chests at the drop positions are not full and contain the expected resources. Ensure the chests are correctly positioned and accessible."}
