{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0)\nConsists of steam engine (position 1), boiler (position 2), and offshore pump (position 3).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 4) and a furnace (position 5).\n- Burner mining drill (position 6) and a furnace (position 7).\n- Burner mining drill (position 8) and a furnace (position 9).\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position 10) and inserter (position 11) that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position 12) that connects the furnace at position 5 to the assembling machine at position 10.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting iron-gear-wheels requires iron-plates, which must be available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when inspecting furnace inventory\n- Verify that the furnace is operational and has items to inspect before checking its inventory."}
