Exact entity positions were not provided in the previous snippet.*\n\n### Mining/Smelting Area Cleanup\n*   The agent performed cleanup operations in the mining and smelting area, picking up numerous `transport-belt` and `underground-belt` entities, particularly around the coordinates associated with the previous iron ore transport system (e.g., x=27.5 y=84.5 to x=51.5 y=86.5).\n*   Attempts to recreate the main Iron Ore belt between x=38.0 y=86.5 and x=51.0 y=86.5 failed in multiple steps. The structure of the iron ore transport is currently dismantled or incomplete.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with belts\n*   Failures occurred when trying to recreate the Iron Ore belt (e.g., \"Not a valid path to normalise\","}
