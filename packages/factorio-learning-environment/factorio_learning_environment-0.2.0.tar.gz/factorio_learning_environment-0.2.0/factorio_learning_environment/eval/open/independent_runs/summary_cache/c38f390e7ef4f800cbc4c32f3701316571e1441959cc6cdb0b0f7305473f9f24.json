Regularly check the inventory of source entities to avoid this issue.\n\n### Errors Due to Inserter Output Blocked\n- Make sure there is a destination entity available to receive items from the inserter. Ensure that the destination is not full or blocked by items on the ground.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources in Assembling Machine\n- Regularly check the inventory of the assembling machine to ensure it has the necessary resources to produce the desired items. In this case, ensure a sufficient supply of copper plates for the copper cable production.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Regularly supply the furnace with the required ores to maintain production efficiency."}
