{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a warning of \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions:\n  - (-15.5, -51.5) waiting for source items\n  - (-14.5, -51.5) waiting for source items\n  - (-13.5, -51.5) waiting for source items\n  - (-15.5, -48.5) waiting for space in destination with a warning of \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (-15.5, -53.5)\n  - (-17.5, -51.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with status FULL_OUTPUT and warnings \"furnace result is full.\"\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions:\n  - (0.5, -1.5) waiting for space in destination with a warning \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked.\"\n  - (-1.5, 0.5) waiting for space in destination with a warning \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked.\"\n  - (1.5, 0.5) waiting for space in destination with a warning \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked.\"\n\n### Additional Inserter Setup\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions:\n  - (0.5, 2.5) waiting for source items\n  - (0.5, 3.5) waiting for source items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Supply Chain Management\n- **Issue**: \"Could not insert: Could not find a nearby entity that can accept iron-ore.\"\n  - **Tip**: Ensure that there is a valid destination entity (e.g., a furnace or chest) within reach of the inserters to accept the output from mining drills.\n\n### Errors Related to Output Blockages\n- **Issue**: \"Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n  - **Tip**: Regularly clear items from the ground and ensure that there are entities ready to accept outputs from mining drills and inserters.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Output\n- **Issue**: \"Furnace result is full.\"\n  - **Tip**: Ensure that the furnace output is regularly cleared to prevent production halts. Consider adding more storage or processing capacity.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Drop Positions\n- **Issue**: \"Furnace belt at drop position is blocked.\"\n  - **Tip**: Check that belts are not obstructed and there is space for inserters to drop items. Ensure that downstream entities are not full or blocked.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- **Function**: `fix_supply_chain_issues()`\n  - **Failure Mode**: Unable to insert items due to lack of nearby accepting entities.\n  - **Success Mode**: Successfully clears blockages and ensures continuous flow of items.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'transport-belt', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n- `entity_status`: Dict[Tuple[float, float], str] - Maps entity positions to their current status, such as 'WORKING', 'WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS', 'WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION', etc."}
