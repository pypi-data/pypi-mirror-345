{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe latest harvesting attempt for stone has been successful:\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the new one)\n  - 9 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **5 pieces of stone** available (which meets the requirement).\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### New Active Furnace Status:\n- The furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is currently empty and shows **4 pieces of coal** as fuel remaining.\n- The furnace status indicates **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"**, confirming that it is still not processing anything despite having enough stone and Copper Ore.\n\n### Observations:\n- I now possess enough stone to enable the smelting of Copper Ore, fulfilling the total requirement of **5 pieces**.\n- The furnace's failure to process suggests it may need the inputs to be reinserted after a reset.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Stone into the Furnace**: I will insert the **5 pieces of stone** into the active furnace.\n2. **Insert Copper Ore**: After loading the stone, I will also reinsert the **1 piece of Copper Ore** to allow for the smelting process to begin.\n3. **Monitor for Processing Activation**: After the materials are loaded, I will confirm if the furnace starts processing.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by inserting the required pieces of stone into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load 5 pieces of stone into the active furnace to meet smelting requirements\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, new_active_furnace, quantity=5)  # Insert the required pieces of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nnew_active_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_stone_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone.\n\nprint(f\"New Active Furnace inventory status after loading stone: {new_active_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading stone: {overall_inventory_after_stone_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations. \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-406]"}
