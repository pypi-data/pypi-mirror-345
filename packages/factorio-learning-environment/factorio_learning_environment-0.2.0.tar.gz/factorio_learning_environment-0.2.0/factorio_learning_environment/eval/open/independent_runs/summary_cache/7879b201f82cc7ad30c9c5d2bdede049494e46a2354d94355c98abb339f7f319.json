{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0, 0)\nConsists of steam engine (position 0, 1), boiler (position 0, 2), and offshore pump (position 0, 3).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position (1, 0).\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (2, 0) and inserter at position (3, 0) that puts into assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position 4, 0) that connects the furnace at position (1, 0) to the assembling machine at position (2, 0).\n\n### Research lab at position(5, 5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position 5, 5) with no power and currently researching automation.\n\n### Stone furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 0, 0) with coal as fuel and currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone furnace at position(5, 5)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 5, 5) with coal as fuel and currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup (id=4924) with poles at positions [(4.5, 3.5), (-3.5, 5.5), (6.5, 5.5), ..., (-5.5, 19.5), (-5.5, 24.5), (1.5, -7.5)].\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to inspect is valid and exists on the map. Check the position and prototype before calling the inspect function.\n\n### Errors related to electric poles\n- Verify that the electric pole you are trying to access is correctly placed and exists. If you receive an assertion error, check the coordinates and ensure the pole is not stale or removed.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities in the target position."}
