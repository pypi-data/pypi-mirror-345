These systems coordinate the flow of power, fluids, and materials across production areas.\n\n### Offshore Pump and Fluid Network\nConsists of an offshore pump located at (0.5, 30.5) which feeds water into the fluid system via a network of connected pipes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Persistent Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue\n  \u2013 The extra steam engine remains unplaceable due to severe congestion in the boiler area. Overlapping and misaligned burner\u2011inserters and transport belts, together with an obstructed buildable zone near (8.5, 22.5), prevent its installation.\n  \u2013 Recommendation: Perform a thorough manual inspection of the boiler region and surrounding connections. Remove, reposition, or adjust interfering entities and consider relocating the extra steam engine or modifying the boiler layout to create sufficient clearance.\n\n\u2022 Burner Fuel Supply Shortages\n  \u2013 Multiple burner\u2011inserters and the burner\u2011mining drill are frequently reporting \u201cout of fuel\u201d or \u201cwaiting for source items.\u201d\n  \u2013 Recommendation: Ensure that fuel sources are properly positioned adjacent to these burner\u2010powered entities and that a continuous fuel supply is maintained.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connectivity and Fluid Input Issues\n  \u2013 Numerous steam engines display warnings including \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d and \u201cno input liquid.\u201d\n  \u2013 Recommendation: Review and reconfigure electrical cabling and fluid pipe arrangements to ensure that all steam engines are properly connected to their respective power and fluid networks.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Deficiency\n  \u2013 The automation research lab is experiencing a deficit in stable power connectivity.\n  \u2013 Recommendation: Reassess the placement and configuration of nearby electrical poles and wiring to provide a reliable power supply to the lab.\n\n\u2022 General Layout Congestion\n  \u2013 The boiler area is highly congested, which is impeding the placement of the extra steam engine and possibly affecting other connectivity issues.\n  \u2013 Recommendation: Reevaluate the spatial layout to reduce overlap and clear obstructed buildable zones, thereby ensuring that all structures can be properly placed and interconnected."}
