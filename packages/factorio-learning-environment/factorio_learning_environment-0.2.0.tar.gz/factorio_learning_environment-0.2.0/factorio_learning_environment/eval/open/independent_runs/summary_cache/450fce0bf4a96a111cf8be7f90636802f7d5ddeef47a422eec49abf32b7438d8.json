{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Manufacturing Area (around position x=2-11, y=0-2)\nConsists of:\n- Three stone furnaces at positions (2,0), (5,0), and (8,0)\n- Burner inserter at (3.5,0.5) connecting furnaces\n- Wooden chest at (4.5,1.5)\n- Inserter at (9.5,1.5)\n- Wooden chest at (8.5,1.5) containing iron plates, copper plates and iron gear wheels\n- Assembling machine at (11.5,1.5) for automation science pack production\n- Inserter at (13.5,1.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (14.5,1.5) containing automation science packs\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (0,4.5) with full output status\n- Steam engine at (6.5,4.5) \n- Fuel inserter at (0.5,2.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5,25.5) providing water\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting the components\n- Electric pole network with multiple poles\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups:\n- Belt system from (0.5,1.5) to (-3.5,6.5)\n- Belt system from (4.5,2.5) to (1.5,5.5)\n- Belt system around (3.5,2.5) to (3.5,5.5)\n- Belt system from (6.5,2.5) to (4.5,2.5)\n- Belt system from (7.5,3.5) to (-4.5,19.5)\n- Belt system from (1.5,5.5) to (1.5,11.5)\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of 10 labs in various states, some containing automation science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with wood crafting\n- Wood cannot be crafted - it must be harvested from trees before crafting items requiring wood like electric poles\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Check if target location is clear before placing entities like steam engines\n- Verify there are no existing objects blocking placement\n- When placing connected entities (like steam engines and boilers), ensure proper spacing and alignment\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Ensure power poles are properly connected to form a complete electrical network\n- Place power poles within connection range of each other\n- Connect power consumers (inserters, assembling machines) to the power network\n\n### Steam engine setup issues\n- Ensure proper pipe connections between boiler and steam engine\n- Remove empty/disconnected pipe groups before creating new connections\n- Verify steam engine has both input and output connections properly set up\n\n### Fuel management\n- Keep boilers and burner inserters supplied with fuel (coal)\n- Monitor fuel levels to prevent equipment shutdowns"}
