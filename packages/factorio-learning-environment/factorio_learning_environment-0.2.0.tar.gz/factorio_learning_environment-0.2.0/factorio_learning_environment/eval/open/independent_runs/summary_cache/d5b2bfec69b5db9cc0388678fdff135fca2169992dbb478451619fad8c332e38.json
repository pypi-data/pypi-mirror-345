{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\n- **Offshore pump** at position (-9.5, 19.5) - Working, connected to water system\n- **Boiler** at position (18.0, 22.5) - Fueled with coal, steam output at 165\u00b0C\n- **Steam engine** at position (22.5, 22.5) - Not connected to power network\n- **Pipes** (29 water pipes and 10 steam pipes) forming complete fluid system\n\n### Oil Processing Complex\n- **Pumpjack** at position (17.5, 40.5) - Not receiving power\n- **Oil refinery** at position (27.5, 40.5) - Recipe set to basic oil processing, not powered\n- **Storage tank** at position (32.5, 22.5) - Contains petroleum gas (40.46 units)\n- **Pipes** (46 pipes) connecting refinery to storage\n\n### Chemical Production Setup\n- **Chemical plant** at position (37.5, 22.5) - Recipe set to sulfur production, not powered\n- **Power poles** network with 435 poles, voltage at 4.29MW\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid System Connection Issues\n- Verify source has fluid before connecting (chemical plant connection failed due to empty source)\n- Check connection point availability (oil refinery index error)\n- Ensure proper spacing between connection points (repeated pipe connection failures)\n- Confirm fluid types match between source and target (chemical plant input requirements)\n\n### Power System Verification\n- Confirm power connection before asserting working status (refinery power verification)\n- Check all entities in power network are properly connected (steam engine connection issue)\n- Verify power supply meets demand (chemical plant power issues)\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Move within placement range before attempting to place entities (wooden chest placement)\n- Clear target position before placing new entities (existing object conflicts)\n- Verify placement coordinates are valid (position assertion errors)\n\n### System Validation\n- Verify all system components before asserting working state\n- Check fluid levels in connected systems\n- Monitor power consumption vs production\n- Define all required variables before use (output_chest reference)\n\n### Programming Best Practices\n- Validate array indices before access (refinery connection points)\n- Check entity status before assertions\n- Implement proper error handling for connection attempts\n- Handle None cases in entity lookups (power network rebuilding)\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `connect_fluid_system(source: Entity, target: Entity, pipe_count: int) -> bool` - Needs additional fluid validation\n- `verify_power_connection(entity: Entity) -> bool` - Requires implementation to check power status\n\n### Variables\n- `steam_engine_pos: Position` - Position of steam engine needing power connection\n- `refinery_pos: Position` - Location of oil refinery\n- `chemical_plant_pos: Position` - Location of chemical production facility\n- `output_chest_pos: Position` - Undefined target position (40.5, 22.5)"}
