{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with an inventory containing 9 iron ore.\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with an inventory containing 47 iron ore and 100 iron plates as output. It is currently working but has a warning indicating that the result is full.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently out of fuel and has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when extracting from a chest with insufficient inventory**\n  - Ensure that the chest has enough items before extracting. The chest at (-14.5, -48.5) had insufficient iron ore during multiple extraction attempts.\n  \n- **Errors when inserting into a furnace that is full**\n  - Check the output inventory of the furnace before inserting items. The furnace at (0.0, 0.0) had a warning indicating that its result inventory is full.\n\n- **Errors when the burner mining drill is out of fuel**\n  - Make sure to refuel the burner mining drill regularly to avoid it becoming inactive.
