{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe Groups connecting these entities:\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-45.5, -122.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -121.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -118.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-42.5, -119.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-44.5, -116.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) for storage\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and Position (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected to form a continuous path between entities. Verify the positions and connections of each pipe to ensure they are not misaligned or disconnected.\n\n### Boiler Not Operational\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to both a water source and a steam engine. Check for any missing or incorrectly placed pipes that might prevent the flow of water to the boiler.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a power network. Ensure that electric poles are correctly placed and connected to provide power to all necessary entities.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner mining drills and ensure they are refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests used in mining operations and clear them regularly to prevent overflow and halt in production."}
