{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the structures and error tips:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area (Position x=0-2)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Furnace 1 at position(0,0) processing iron ore\n- Furnace 2 at position(2,0) processing iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production Area (Position x=4, y=4)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace processing copper ore\n\n### Electronic Circuit Production Line (Position x=6.5-12.5, y=11.5)\nConsists of:\n- Input wooden chest at position(6.5,11.5) containing iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position(7.5,11.5) moving items from input chest to assembler\n- Assembling machine at position(9.5,11.5) crafting electronic circuits\n- Burner inserter at position(11.5,11.5) moving finished products\n- Output wooden chest at position(12.5,11.5) storing electronic circuits\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=-9.5 to -2.5, y=22.5-26.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5,24.5)\n- Pipe network carrying water\n- Boiler at position(-7.0,24.5)\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5,24.5)\n- Connected pipe network carrying steam\n- Electric pole network distributing power\n\n### Science Pack Research Area (Position y=28.5-31.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position not fully visible)\n- Burner inserter at position(0.5,30.5)\n- Storage chest at position(0.5,31.5) containing science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Research Prerequisites Not Met\n- Cannot research advanced technologies without completing prerequisites first\n- Research order should be:\n  1. Engine\n  2. Fluid Handling\n  3. Oil Processing\n  4. Plastics/Sulfur Processing\n  5. Advanced Electronics\n\n### Already Researched Technologies\n- Avoid attempting to research already completed technologies:\n  - Steel Processing\n  - Electronics\n  - Logistics 2\n\n### Resource Shortages\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices - multiple instances of running out of coal\n- Ensure sufficient copper cable supply for electronic circuit production\n\n### Research Progress Tracking\n- Keep track of required science pack quantities for ongoing research\n- Current research (Fast Inserter) requires 30 automation science packs"}
