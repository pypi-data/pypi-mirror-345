{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working with partial inventories of iron ore and iron plates.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates, with chest at (21.5, 75.5) holding significant iron plates inventory.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, currently empty.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational, moving items between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position persists, causing mining drill output blockage.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, though output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), not connected to power network and lacking input fluid, currently not working.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity from steam power but currently is non-operational due to lack of fuel and power connection issues.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power network but currently not powered, with input inventory holding iron plates and iron gear wheels, output inventory mirroring input.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area, stocked with iron plates.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently holding iron gear wheels.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled with coal and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine input occasionally full, sometimes no iron gear wheels available to extract, indicating intermittent crafting or extraction issues.\n\nThis structure is used for iron gear wheel production, with power and output inserter setup functional, and iron plate supply sufficient. However, assembling machine power status and output extraction require attention.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failure to place transport belts and small electric poles at positions near furnace and steam engine due to existing objects blocking placement.\n- To avoid these errors, always verify tile occupancy before placement and consider adjusting placement coordinates or orientation to find free tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Some inserters report waiting for source items, indicating occasional input shortages.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to prevent stoppages and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) sometimes not powered despite connection; power network issues may be causing this.\n- Assembling machine input inventory often full of iron plates and iron gear wheels, but output inventory mirrors input, indicating extraction or crafting flow issues.\n- Attempts to extract iron gear wheels from assembling machine failed due to entity not found or no items available.\n- Ensure assembling machine is properly powered and output items are extracted timely to avoid crafting stalls.\n- Maintain clear output paths and verify inserters extracting output are operational.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory sometimes full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out"}
