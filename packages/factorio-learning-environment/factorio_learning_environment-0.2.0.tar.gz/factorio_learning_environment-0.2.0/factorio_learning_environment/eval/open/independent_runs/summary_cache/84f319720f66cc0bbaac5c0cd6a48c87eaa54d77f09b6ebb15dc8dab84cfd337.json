{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities such as the Burner Mining Drill, Stone Furnace, and Wooden Chest have failed, resulting in no entities being successfully placed or updated on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests failed due to occupied positions.\n\n### Errors with BuildingBox size\n- When determining a buildable spot for the Burner Mining Drill, ensure the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. Consider using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if a single large one does not fit.\n\n### Errors with data types in code\n- Ensure that the correct data types are used when defining variables. For instance, the error in creating a BuildingBox suggests using `int()` on a non-numeric type. Verify that all arguments passed to functions are of the expected type.\n\n### Errors with API usage\n- When using functions like `get_entities`, ensure all arguments are of the correct type. For example, the second argument must be a Position object, not a string or other type.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Before attempting to place any entity, confirm that the position is valid and that there is sufficient space for the entity. This includes checking for any obstacles or existing entities that may block placement."}
