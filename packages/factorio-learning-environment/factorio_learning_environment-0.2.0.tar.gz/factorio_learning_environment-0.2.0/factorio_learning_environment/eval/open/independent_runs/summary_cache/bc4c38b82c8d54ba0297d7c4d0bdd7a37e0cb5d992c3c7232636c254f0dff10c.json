{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction and Storage at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5)\n- Storage tank at position (21.5, 41.5)\n- PipeGroup(fluid_system=14896, position=x=24.5 y=43.5, status=EntityStatus.EMPTY, pipes=[(24.5,y=43.5),(25.5,y=43.5),(26.5,y=43.5),...,(28.5,y=45.5),(28.5,y=46.5),(29.5,y=46.5)]) connecting Pumpjack to storage tank\n- ElectricityGroup(id=22626, poles=[(-5.5,y=59.5),(-15.5,y=61.5),(-8.5,y=60.5),...(-13.5,y=55.5),(-11.5,y=55.5),(-10.5,y=50.5)], voltage=0) connecting Pumpjack to Steam Engine and offshore pumps\n\n### Electricity Generator at position(24.5, 46.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (24.5, 46.5)\n- Boiler at position(-7.5, 73.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 69.5) and another offshore pump at position(-9.5, 70.5)\n- PipeGroup(fluid_system=14900, position=x=7.5 y=49.5, status=EntityStatus.EMPTY, pipes=[(7.5,y=49.5),(8.5,y=49.5),(8.5,y=48.5),...(-9.5,y=67.5),(-9.5,y=66.5),(-8.5,y=66.5)]) connecting offshore pumps to boiler\n- ElectricityGroup(id=22626, poles=[(-5.5,y=59.5),(-15.5,y=61.5),(-8.5,y=60.5),...(-13.5,y=55.5),(-11.5,y=55.5),(-10.5,y=50.5)]) connecting Steam Engine to Pumpjack and offshore pumps\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or unplaceable terrain\n- Check if the target location is occupied by another entity or is part of unplaceable terrain (like water) before attempting to place an entity\n- Ensure the area is clear and suitable for the entity you are trying to place\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with poles\n- Ensure that the source and target entities for the pole connection are valid and can be connected\n- Verify that there are no obstructions between the entities that could prevent a successful connection\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure that the source and target entities for the pipe connection are valid\n- Verify that there are no obstructions between the entities that could prevent a successful connection\n- Check that the source and target entities for the pipe connection are valid and target entities can receive fluid from the source\n\n### New errors\n- Name 's' is not defined. Check that all variables are properly defined before use.\n- Could not place pumpjack at a certain position because an entity already exists at that position. Remove the existing entity before continuing.\n- Cannot place pumpjack at the target location because something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable. Check the target location before attempting to place the pumpjack.\n- Did not find any valid connections between source and target entities. Make sure none of the source or target connections points are blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity(entity_type, position)`: Places an entity of the given type at the specified position. \n    - Failure modes: Entity already exists at the target position, target location is unplaceable.\n    - Success modes: Entity is successfully placed at the target position.\n- `connect_entities(source, target, connection_type)`: Connects two entities using the specified connection type (e.g., pipes or poles).\n    - Failure modes: Source or target entities are invalid, connection points are blocked, target entity cannot receive the connection.\n    - Success modes: Entities are successfully connected.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `crude_oil_resource`: Position(x=17.5, y=40.5)\n- `alternative_position`: Position(x=19.5, y=40.5)\n- `offshore_pump`: Prototype.OffshorePump at position(-11.5, 69.5) and (-9.5, 70.5)\n- `boiler`: Prototype.Boiler at position(-7.5, 73.0)\n- `pumpjack"}
