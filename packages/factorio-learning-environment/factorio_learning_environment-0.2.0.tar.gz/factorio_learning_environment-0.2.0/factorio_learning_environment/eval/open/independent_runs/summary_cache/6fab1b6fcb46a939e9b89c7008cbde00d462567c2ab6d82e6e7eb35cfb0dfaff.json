{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-28, -59) smelting copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (-29.5, -58.5) moving plates from furnace\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -57.5) for output storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), and (-6, -59)\n- Three wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\n- All drills are operational and connected to respective output chests\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n- Four input burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5)\n- Four output burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- Four input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) containing coal\n- Four output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5) containing iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Coal Management Issues\n- Ensure sufficient coal is in inventory before attempting to insert fuel into entities\n- Keep track of coal levels in burner devices to prevent them from stopping\n\n### Entity Output Blocking\n- When setting up mining drills, ensure there is a valid output entity (chest, belt, or furnace) in the drop position\n- Check that the mining drill's output is not blocked by items on the ground\n\n### Entity Placement and Connection\n- Verify that inserters are properly aligned with their source and destination entities\n- Ensure inserters' pickup and drop positions match with the intended source and target entities\n- When placing multiple entities in a production line, maintain proper spacing and alignment between connected components"}
