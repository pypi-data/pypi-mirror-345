{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with a full inventory of coal (50/50) and producing iron plates (65 iron plates produced).\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) with an inventory containing 602 iron ore.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) currently working but with a warning that the chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into a full inventory**\n  - Ensure that the target entity (e.g., furnace) has available space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. In this case, the Stone Furnace was full (50/50 items), causing the insertion of coal to fail.\n\n- **Errors when extracting from a chest that is full**\n  - The Burner Mining Drill is unable to continue mining because the Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Regularly check and empty chests to ensure they do not reach capacity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `insert_item(item_type, target_entity, quantity)`: This function is used to insert items into a specified entity's inventory. It has encountered failures due to full inventories.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `furnace`: Type - Furnace, Position - (0.0, 0.0)\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Type - Burner Mining Drill, Position - (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - `wooden_chest`: Type - Wooden Chest, Position - (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - `inventory`: Type - Inventory, Content - {'wood': 4, 'coal': 195, 'iron-ore': 419, 'iron-plate': 35}"}
