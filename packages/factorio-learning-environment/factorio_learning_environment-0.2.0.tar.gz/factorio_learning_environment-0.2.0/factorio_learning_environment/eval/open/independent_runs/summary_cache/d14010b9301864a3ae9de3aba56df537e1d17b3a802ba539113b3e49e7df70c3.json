{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting from position (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the belt to another wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) collecting iron plates from the production line.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure there is enough space and the position is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider increasing spacing or changing the direction or reference position if placement fails due to an existing entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to take items from a chest before attempting to connect them to a belt. Direct connections from a chest to a belt are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, ensure you have wooden chests available before placing them.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required raw materials\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before crafting. For instance, gather wood before attempting to craft a wooden chest if wood is a required component."}
