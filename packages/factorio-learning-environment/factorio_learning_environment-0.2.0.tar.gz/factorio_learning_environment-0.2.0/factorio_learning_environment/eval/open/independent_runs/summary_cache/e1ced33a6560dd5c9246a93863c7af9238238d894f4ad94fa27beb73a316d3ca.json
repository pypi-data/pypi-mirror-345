{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-11.5, 18.5)\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position(-21.5, 28.0)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position(5.0, 5.0) and a furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position(y1) to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place a pipe. The maximum distance for placing pipes is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors when placing into an occupied tile\n- Ensure that the target position is clear before attempting to place an entity. If an entity already exists at the target position, remove it before continuing.\n\n### Errors with boiler connection\n- Check that the boiler is connected to a fluid source and has fuel. Ensure that the input liquid is available and that there are no obstructions in the connections."}
