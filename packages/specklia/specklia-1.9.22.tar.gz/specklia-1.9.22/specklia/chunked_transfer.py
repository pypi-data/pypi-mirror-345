"""
Interface to Mongo for using Mongo as a buffer for chunked data transfer.

We use Mongo as a buffer because we cannot guarantee that all of the requests
for individual chunks will hit the same worker. While we could use streamed responses for the download,
they're not available for upload, so for simplicity we use the same approach in both directions.

The intended usage pattern is that a single message is stored as a single "chunk set".
The chunk set is first "filled" (either by the client or the server), then "emptied" to obtain the data
(again, by either the client or the server).

Note that while this can be used for pagination, it is not in itself pagination.

We plan to gather most of this material into ew_common after the chunked transfer interface has been rolled out
to its three main users (ew_geostore, ew_specklia, ew_online_processing_service) and proven effective for each.
At that point, this entire module will move into ew_common. Note that the chunked transfer interface will always
require MongoDB or a similar provision to work correctly.

IMPORTANT: THE VERSION HERE IN THE SPECKLIA PACKAGE MUST NOT BE MADE DEPENDENT UPON EW_COMMON SINCE EW_COMMON
IS PRIVATE BUT THIS PACKAGE IS PUBLIC!
