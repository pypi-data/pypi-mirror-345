{"content": "I notice a pattern in the errors - we keep trying to insert iron ore when we don't have any in our inventory. Let's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nLet's focus on what we can do with our current resources:\n1. Check current inventory\n2. Craft iron gear wheels with existing plates\n3. Extract remaining plates from furnaces\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check our starting inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Starting inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Calculate how many gear wheels we can craft\niron_plates = inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\nmax_gears = iron_plates // 2  # Each gear needs 2 plates\nnum_to_craft = min(max_gears, 20)  # Let's limit to 20 at a time\n\nif num_to_craft > 0:\n    craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=num_to_craft)\n    print(f\"Crafted {num_to_craft} iron gear wheels\")\n\n# Extract any remaining plates from furnaces\nfurnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nfor furnace in furnaces:\n    if furnace.furnace_result.get('iron-plate', 0) > 0:\n        move_to(furnace.position)\n        extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, quantity=25)\n\n# Only add coal if we have it and furnaces need it\ninventory = inspect_inventory()  # Get updated inventory\nif Prototype.Coal in inventory:\n    for furnace in furnaces:\n        if furnace.fuel.get('coal', 0) < 10:  # Only if coal is low\n            move_to(furnace.position)\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=25)\n\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})}\")\n```\n\nKey improvements:\n1. Removed attempts to insert iron ore since we don't have any\n2. Added inventory checks before trying to insert items\n3. Limited gear wheel crafting to a reasonable amount\n4. Added move_to() before each furnace interaction\n5. Only attempt to add coal if furnaces are running low\n\nThis should run without errors and make the most of our current resources.", "summary_range": "[1-202]"}
