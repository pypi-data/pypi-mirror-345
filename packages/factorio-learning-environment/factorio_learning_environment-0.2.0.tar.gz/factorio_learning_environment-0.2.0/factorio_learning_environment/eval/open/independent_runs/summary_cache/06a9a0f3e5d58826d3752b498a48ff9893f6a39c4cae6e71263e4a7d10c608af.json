{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is actively mining coal.\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which is used to store coal extracted by the Burner Mining Drill. Currently, it is full and needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when the Wooden Chest is full**\n  - Ensure to regularly empty the Wooden Chest at (41.5, -80.5) to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue mining coal.\n\n- **Errors when the Burner Mining Drill runs out of fuel**\n  - Monitor the fuel levels of the Burner Mining Drill and ensure it is refueled when necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n- **Errors related to missing ingredients for the Stone Furnace**\n  - Check the inventory of the Stone Furnace and ensure it has the necessary ingredients to smelt. \n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None reported.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n  - `wooden_chest_position`: Position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n  - `stone_furnace_position`: Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)"}
