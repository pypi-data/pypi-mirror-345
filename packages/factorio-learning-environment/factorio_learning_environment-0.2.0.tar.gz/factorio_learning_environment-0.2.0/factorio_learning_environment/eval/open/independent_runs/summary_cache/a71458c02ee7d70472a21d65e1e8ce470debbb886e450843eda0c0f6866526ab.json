{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Storage Facility\n- **Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a transport belt and chest at position (40.5, -83.5).\n\n### Iron Processing Facility\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) used for smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a chest.\n- **Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) transferring items from the chest to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (4.5, 0.5) functioning properly, connecting the inserter to the next stage.\n\n### Copper Processing Facility\n- **Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0) used for smelting copper ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring items from a chest to the furnace.\n- **Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates and iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (11.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a chest.\n- **Chest** at position (12.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Transport and Inserter Network\n- **BeltGroup** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5) for item transport.\n- Multiple **Burner Inserters** positioned strategically to facilitate item movement between chests, furnaces, and belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from transport belts\n- Ensure the transport belt contains the specific item you want to extract before attempting extraction. Verify the presence of items on the belt.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into full inventories\n- Check the inventory capacity of the destination entity before inserting items. Avoid attempting to insert items into full inventories.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter contains items to be moved. Regularly check and supply the source entities with necessary items.\n\n### Errors with missing entities for inserters\n- Verify the presence of entities at the pickup and drop positions of inserters. Ensure that the inserters are correctly aligned with their source and destination entities.\n\n### Errors when inserting items not present in inventory\n- Confirm that the items you intend to insert are available in your inventory before attempting the insertion action."}
