{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) with status: No ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) with status: No fuel and no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, -0.5) set to pick up from (1.5, 0.5) and drop at (1.5, -1.5), status: Waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, -0.5) set to pick up from (3.5, 0.5) and drop at (3.5, -1.5), status: Waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-0.5, 1.5) set to pick up from (0.5, 1.5) and drop at (-1.5, 1.5), status: Waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 2.5) set to pick up from (1.5, 3.5) and drop at (1.5, 1.5), status: Waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 2.5) set to pick up from (3.5, 3.5) and drop at (3.5, 1.5), status: Waiting for source items.\n\n### Conveyor Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs: Belt from (x=-11.5 y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5 y=-50.5), direction: LEFT; outputs: Belt from (x=-13.5 y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5 y=-52.5), direction: UP.\n- BeltGroup with inputs: Belt from (x=-12.5 y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5 y=-52.5), direction: UP; Belt from (x=-11.5 y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5 y=-51.5), direction: UP; outputs: Belt from (x=-11.5 y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5 y=-52.5), direction: LEFT.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure you have sufficient resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, make sure you have enough coal and iron ore before trying to refuel furnaces or supply them with raw materials.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Verify that inserters have access to the necessary resources and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Ensure that the source and destination positions are correctly aligned with the inserter's operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Check that furnaces have both fuel and the necessary ingredients to operate. If a furnace is not working, ensure it is supplied with both fuel and raw materials like iron ore.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities, ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another entity to avoid placement errors."}
