{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) for transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest to another location.\n- Additional Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) for further coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) for additional item transfer operations.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory in Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage capacity.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check and ensure that the source items are available for the inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) to function correctly. This may involve ensuring that the connected chest has the necessary items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_drill_position`: Tuple[float, float] = (-12.0, -51.0)\n- `stone_furnace_position`: Tuple[float, float] = (-14.0, -49.0)\n- `coal_drill_position`: Tuple[float, float] = (52.0, -82.0)\n- `iron_ore_chest_position`: Tuple[float, float] = (-11.5, -49.5)\n- `coal_chest_position`: Tuple[float, float] = (53.5, -80.5)"}
