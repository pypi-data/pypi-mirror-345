{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) for dropping resources.\n- The drill is currently working but has a warning that the chest at drop position is full. \n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) contains iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to full chest\n- The burner mining drill has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full. To avoid this, regularly check and empty the chest to ensure continuous mining operations.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Ensure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Repeated actions without effect\n- The agent has repeatedly refueled the Burner Mining Drill and fed iron ore into the Stone Furnace without any change in status. Ensure to check the status of entities before performing actions to avoid unnecessary actions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `burner_mining_drill_position`: Position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- `stone_furnace_position`: Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- `wooden_chest_position`: Position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- `iron_plate_count`: Integer (100)\n- `iron_ore_count`: Integer (3115)\n- `coal_count`: Integer (3)"}
