{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-10.5, y=-48.5) which is responsible for inserting items into the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-7.5, y=-49.5) which transfers items from the chest\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-5.5, y=-49.5) which transfers items from the belt to the chest\n\n### Belt Groups\n- BeltGroup 1: Connects positions (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5) in a rightward direction, consisting of 4 belts\n- BeltGroup 2: Connects positions (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5) in a rightward direction and (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5) in an upward direction, consisting of 13 belts\n- BeltGroup 3: Connects positions (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) in a leftward direction and (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5) in a rightward direction, consisting of 10 belts\n- Individual Belt: Connects positions (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5) in an upward direction\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists and contains the items you wish to extract before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when finding nearest entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to find exists on the map. If not, consider placing the entity first or checking the map data for its presence.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target tile is free of other objects to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use an inserter to connect belts to chests, as belts cannot be directly connected to chest entities."}
