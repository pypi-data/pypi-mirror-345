{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and another at (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) moving items between furnaces and a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnaces and chests\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -46.5) storing a large quantity of iron plates\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) for additional storage\n\n### Coal Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserters at various positions ensuring coal supply to furnaces and other inserters\n- Transport Belts distributing coal between chests and inserters\n\n### Electricity Generator\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Multiple Boilers at positions (1.5, 18.0), (-9.5, 22.0), (-3.5, 22.0), and (0.5, 22.0)\n- PipeGroup connecting the boilers and offshore pump\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple PipeGroups at various positions, facilitating fluid transport across the map\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, providing electrical connections\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on water\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities like pipes and pipe-to-ground is not over water. Adjust the position to avoid overlapping with water tiles.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect Prototype attribute usage\n- When placing entities, ensure the correct attribute names are used. For example, use `PipeGroup` instead of `PipeToGround`.\n\n### Errors when placing entities where objects already exist\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target location is clear of existing objects. Adjust the position or clear the area if necessary."}
