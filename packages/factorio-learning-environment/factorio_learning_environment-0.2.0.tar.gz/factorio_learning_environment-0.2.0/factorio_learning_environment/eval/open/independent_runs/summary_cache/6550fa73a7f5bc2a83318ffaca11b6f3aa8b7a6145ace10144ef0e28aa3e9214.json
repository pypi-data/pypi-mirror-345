{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-14.5, 20.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position not placed), boiler (position not placed), and offshore pump (position not placed). The boiler placement is obstructed by an electricity group entity.\n\n### Pipe network at position(-4.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=49926) with pipes at positions (-4.5, 21.5), (-3.5, 21.5), (-2.5, 21.5), ..., (-2.5, 24.5), (-3.5, 24.5), (-3.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=49927) at position (-4.5, 23.5) with a pipe at position (-4.5, 23.5)\n\n### Furnace structures\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (5.0, -73.0), name='stone-furnace', status=EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Furnace (position (-18.0, -49.0), name='stone-furnace', status=EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS)\n\n### Electricity group at position(-14.5, 20.5)\nConsists of multiple electricity poles at positions:\n- (x=-15.5, y=18.5)\n- (x=-16.5, y=18.5)\n- (x=-16.5, y=19.5)\n- ...\n- (x=-14.5, y=21.5)\n- (x=-14.5, y=20.5)\n- (x=-16.5, y=21.5)\n\n### Electricity group at position(-19.5, 22.5)\nConsists of multiple electricity poles at positions:\n- (x=-15.5, y=22.5)\n- (x=-19.5, y=23.5)\n- (x=-19.5, y=22.5)\n- (x=-20.5, y=23.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing boiler\n- Ensure that the area where you are attempting to place the boiler is clear of obstructing entities, such as electricity groups.\n\n### Errors related to undefined entities\n- Check that all required classes and entities are properly defined and imported in your code to avoid NameError. In this case, ensure that 'ElectricityPole' is defined before use.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
