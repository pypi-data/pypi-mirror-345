{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) with a transport belt system leading to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5).\n- Transport Belt Group connecting various positions, including a blocked belt at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) connected to a Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5).\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the furnace to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) via a Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using `connect_entities` with `NoneType`\n- Ensure that all entities involved in the connection have been properly initialized and exist on the map before attempting to connect them. This will prevent `AttributeError` related to `NoneType` objects.\n\n### Errors with connecting entities due to invalid path length\n- Verify that the path between entities is valid and that the positions are correctly specified. Ensure that the transport belt can logically connect the two entities without path length issues.\n\n### Errors with blocked transport belts\n- Regularly check and clear any obstructions on transport belts to ensure that resources can flow smoothly. This will prevent mining drills from halting due to blocked drop positions.\n\n### Errors with furnaces and inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt and that inserters have access to source items. This will prevent production halts due to lack of resources."}
