{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt' and containing 51 iron plates.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5).\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) with warnings 'inserter waiting for source items' and 'not receiving electricity', connected to a small electric pole at position (17.5, -0.5).\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) with warning 'not receiving electricity', connected to a stone furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) and a small electric pole at position (17.5, -0.5).\n\n### Pipe Infrastructure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-12.5, y=19.5) with status 'EMPTY', connecting multiple pipe segments.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5) with status 'EMPTY', connecting multiple pipe segments.\n\n### Electrical Infrastructure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=5.5, y=21.5), (x=-16.5, y=25.5), (x=1.5, y=25.5), (x=-0.5, y=3.5), (x=1.5, y=20.5), and (x=-12.5, y=26.5), with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Mining Drills\n- Ensure the area is clear and suitable for placing mining drills. If the current position is not viable, consider expanding the search area or adjusting the BuildingBox size.\n\n### Errors in Power Infrastructure Setup\n- Verify connections between offshore pumps and boilers. Ensure pipes are correctly aligned and connected to facilitate fluid transfer.\n\n### Errors Connecting Power to Inserters\n- Confirm the presence of a steam engine at the specified position before attempting to connect power. Ensure all power connections are correctly established to provide electricity to inserters.\n\n### Ore Chest Placement\n- Ensure ore chests are placed correctly and defined in the system to avoid processing errors.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply\n- Check that inserters are connected to a power source and receiving electricity. Address any warnings related to the inserter's power status to ensure proper operation."}
