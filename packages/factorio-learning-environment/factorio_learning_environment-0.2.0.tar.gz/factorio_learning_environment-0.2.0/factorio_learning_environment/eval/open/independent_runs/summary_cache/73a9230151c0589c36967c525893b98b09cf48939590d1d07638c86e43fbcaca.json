{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5). This setup is responsible for mining iron ore and storing it in the chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for additional storage.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. These furnaces are fueled by coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates. Some chests are noted to be full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal when there is none in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to avoid interruptions in mining operations. For instance, the chest at (4.5, -58.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the items are available in the inventory before calling this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory with items such as 'wood', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `entity`: Represents the target entity for operations like insertion and extraction."}
