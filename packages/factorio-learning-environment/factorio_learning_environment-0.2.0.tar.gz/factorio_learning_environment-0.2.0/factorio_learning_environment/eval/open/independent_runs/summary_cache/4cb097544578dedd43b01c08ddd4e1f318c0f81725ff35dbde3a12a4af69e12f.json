{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. The agent has not successfully placed any entities or created any structures in the game world.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. The agent encountered multiple errors when trying to place entities such as Transport Belts, Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and Burner Inserters at various coordinates. This suggests that the target tiles may have been occupied or otherwise unsuitable for placement. Always verify that the placement area is clear and suitable for the intended entity.\n\n### General Inventory Management\n- Regularly check the inventory to ensure that the required items are available for construction and crafting. The agent's inventory logs show a variety of items, but no successful placements, indicating a potential mismatch between available resources and placement attempts."}
