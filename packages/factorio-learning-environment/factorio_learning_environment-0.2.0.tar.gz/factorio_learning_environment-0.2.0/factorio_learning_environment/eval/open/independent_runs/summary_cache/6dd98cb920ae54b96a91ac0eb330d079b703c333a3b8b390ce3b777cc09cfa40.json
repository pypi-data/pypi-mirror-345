{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures present on the map. The agent attempted to place various entities, but none were successfully placed due to errors or unbuildable positions.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on unbuildable positions\n- Ensure the target position for placing an entity is buildable. Check the terrain and any existing entities that might obstruct placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without available resources\n- Verify that the necessary resources are available and accessible before attempting to place entities that require them, such as ensuring coal is available for furnaces.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or restricted areas\n- Confirm that the target tile is not occupied by another entity or restricted by global build restrictions before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without checking build restrictions\n- Always check for any global or local build restrictions that might prevent entity placement in specific areas."}
