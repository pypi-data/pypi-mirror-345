{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as the burner mining drill and burner inserter, have sufficient coal to operate. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Furnace Production Issues\n- The furnace frequently reports \"no ingredients to smelt.\" Ensure that the burner inserter is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the chest contains iron ore and that the inserter is operational and fueled.\n\n### Chest Management\n- The chest at the mining drill's drop position is full. Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent production halts due to storage overflow. Consider expanding storage capacity or increasing the frequency of item extraction."}
