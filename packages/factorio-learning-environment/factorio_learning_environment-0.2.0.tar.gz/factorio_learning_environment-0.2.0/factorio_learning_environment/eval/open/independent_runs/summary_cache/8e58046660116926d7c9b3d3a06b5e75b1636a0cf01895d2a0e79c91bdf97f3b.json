{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Processing Facility\n- **Pumpjack** at position (17.5, 40.5) - Unpowered with crude oil available\n- **Oil Refinery** at position (24.5, 44.5) - Unpowered, configured for basic oil processing\n- **Chemical Plant** at position (31.5, 46.5) - Unpowered, requires coal for plastic production\n- Pipe networks:\n  - Crude oil pipes from pumpjack to refinery (system 12891, status: EMPTY)\n  - Petroleum gas pipes from refinery to chemical plant (system 12894, status: EMPTY)\n\n### Coal Mining Operation\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at position (34.5, 20.5) - Unpowered with coal available\n- Transport belt system moving coal (23 units) towards chemical plant (status: WORKING)\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Partially Operational)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-9.5, -2.5) - Connected but not powered\n- **Boiler** at (2.5, 0.0) - Connected to water supply\n- **Steam Engine** at (5.5, 0.5) - Not producing power\n- Small electric pole network (status: INCOMPLETE)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Construction Issues\n- Repeated boiler placement failures (-9.0, -2.0) and surrounding areas - clear all entities before placement attempts\n- Offshore pump placement errors - verify water source exists at target position before placement\n- Steam engine not producing power - verify proper water and fuel supply connections\n- Power pole network attribute errors - use correct API calls to check power status\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Nearest() function argument mismatch - verify function signature and parameters\n- Position parameter type errors - ensure proper Position objects are used\n- Entity placement validation failures - implement pre-placement checks\n- ElectricityGroup attribute access errors - use correct property names\n\n### Construction Best Practices\n- Always verify entity positions are clear before placement\n- Implement proper error handling for placement failures\n- Check water source availability before pump placement\n- Clear larger areas when encountering placement conflicts\n- Verify power connections before assuming functionality\n\n### System Validation\n- Implement proper power plant validation checks\n- Verify fluid connections before assuming operation\n- Check fuel supply before expecting power generation\n- Test power network connectivity after construction\n\n### Resource Management\n- Coal transport belt clearing needed - verify output paths\n- Power plant location selection - choose clear areas first\n- Inventory management - track placed entities vs available"}
