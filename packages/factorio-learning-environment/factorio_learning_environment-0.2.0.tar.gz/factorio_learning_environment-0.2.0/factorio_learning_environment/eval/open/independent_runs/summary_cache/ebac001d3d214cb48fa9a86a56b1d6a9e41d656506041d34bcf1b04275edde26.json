{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation (Updated)  \n- **Burner mining drills**:  \n  - At (16.0, 71.0) (`WORKING`, fuel: 6 coal, output blocked by ground items).  \n  - At (19.0, 71.0) and (22.0, 71.0) (`WORKING`, fuel: 11 coal each, output blocked).  \n- **Stone furnaces**:  \n  - At (16.0, 73.0) (`FULL_OUTPUT`, fuel: 49 coal, plates: 100/100).  \n  - At (19.0, 73.0) (`WORKING`, fuel: 48 coal, low ore input).  \n  - At (22.0, 73.0) (`NO_INGREDIENTS`, fuel: 50 coal, plates: 4).  \n- **Output system**:  \n  - **Burner inserters** at (19.5, 74.5) and (22.5, 74.5) (`WORKING`).  \n  - **Wooden chests**:  \n    - (16.5, 75.5): 141 iron plates.  \n    - (19.5, 75.5): 218 iron plates.  \n    - (20.5, 75.5): Empty.  \n    - (22.5, 75.5): 215 iron plates.  \n    - (23.5, 75.5): Empty.  \n\n#### Power Generation Setup (Unchanged)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) with connected pipes.  \n- **Boiler** at (-7.0, 0.5) (`WORKING`).  \n- **Steam engine** still unplaced.  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Persistent Placement Issues  \n- **Blocked inserter/belt placement**: Repeated failures at (16.5, 72.5) due to ground items. Use `remove_ground_items()` before placement.  \n- **Invalid mining drill placement**: Attempted at (22.0, 68.0) on unplaceable terrain (likely water). Verify terrain with `can_place_entity()` before placement.  \n\n#### Production Bottlenecks  \n- **Drill output blocked**: All drills drop ore on ground. Prioritize clearing (16.5, 72.5) for inserter placement.  \n- **Furnace inactivity**:  \n  - (16.0, 73.0): Full output (100 plates). Clear plates manually or route to new chests.  \n  - (22.0, 73.0): No ore input. Ensure drills feed furnaces via inserters.  \n\n#### Inventory Management  \n- **Furnace fuel overflow**: Coal insertion at (22.0, 73.0) while fuel is full (50/50). Check fuel levels before inserting.  \n- **Inefficient plate distribution**: Chests at (20.5, 75.5) and (23.5, 75.5) remain empty. Rebalance manually or automate with inserters.  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Debug tools**: Use `debug` mode to inspect entity connections and ground items.  \n- **Throughput collapse**: Current production is 0 plates/minute. Resolve inserter placement and furnace output issues urgently.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \nNo new functions or variables were defined.  \n\n---  \n**Key Updates**:  \n- Furnace at (22.0, 73.0) now idle due to no ore input.  \n- Throughput dropped to **0 plates/minute** (critical).  \n- Chests rebalanced, but new chests remain unused."}
