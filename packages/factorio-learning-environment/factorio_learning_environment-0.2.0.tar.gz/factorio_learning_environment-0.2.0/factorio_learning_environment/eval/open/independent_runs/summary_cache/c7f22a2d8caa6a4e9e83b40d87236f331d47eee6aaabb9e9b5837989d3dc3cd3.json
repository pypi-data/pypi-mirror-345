{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): This drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): This chest temporarily stores the mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): This inserter transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): This furnace processes the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can cause the inserter to not function as intended.\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to ensure it does not become full, which can stop the mining drill from depositing more resources.\n- Ensure that there is a consistent supply of iron ore to the furnace to maintain continuous production of iron plates.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to function. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly transferring resources."}
