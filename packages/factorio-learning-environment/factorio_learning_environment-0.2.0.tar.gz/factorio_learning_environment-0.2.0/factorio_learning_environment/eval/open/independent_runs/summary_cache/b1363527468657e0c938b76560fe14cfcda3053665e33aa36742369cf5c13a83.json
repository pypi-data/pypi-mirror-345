{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), fueled by coal, with a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for additional storage.\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), fueled by coal, processing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0), fueled by coal, processing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5), transferring copper plates from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Iron and Copper Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) for storing iron and copper plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) for storing copper plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), and (x=8.5, y=0.5) for transferring items between chests and belts.\n- BeltGroup connecting the chests and inserters, facilitating the movement of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items from Chests\n- Ensure that the target chest contains the specific item you intend to extract. Verify the inventory of the chest before attempting extraction to avoid errors related to missing items.\n\n### Errors When Inserters Are Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity has the required items available for the inserter to pick up. Maintain a steady supply of items to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests at Drop Positions\n- Regularly check and clear out chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of connected mining drills and inserters. Consider expanding storage capacity if necessary.\n\n### Errors When Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This ensures that the extraction command is within range and can be executed successfully."}
