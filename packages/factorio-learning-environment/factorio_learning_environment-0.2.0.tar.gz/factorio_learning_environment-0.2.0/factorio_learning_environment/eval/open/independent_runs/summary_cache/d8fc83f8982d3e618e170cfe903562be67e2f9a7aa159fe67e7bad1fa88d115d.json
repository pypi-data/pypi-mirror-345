{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently working and producing iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0) that is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) that is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Burner Inserters\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that is waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that is waiting for space in destination.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) containing coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using burner mining drills without fuel\n- Ensure that burner mining drills are supplied with fuel before attempting to operate them.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for items\n- Check the source inventory of inserters to ensure they have items to pick up. If they are waiting for source items, verify that the source entity has items available.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target location.\n\n### Repeated extraction from the same wooden chest\n- Avoid excessive extraction from the same wooden chest in quick succession, as it may lead to inventory depletion. Consider spreading out extractions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron_plate`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `iron_gear_wheel`: int"}
