{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) with an inventory containing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) with coal as fuel, waiting for source items. It is positioned to transfer items from the mining drill to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** system starting at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) and ending at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5), facilitating the movement of items from the mining drill to the furnace area.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel. It currently has no ingredients to smelt and is in a 'no ingredients' status.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) with coal as fuel, waiting for source items. It is positioned to transfer items from the transport belt to the stone furnace.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the mining drill is emptied regularly to prevent mining operations from halting.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Make sure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production. Check the transport belt connections and inserter operations to ensure materials are reaching the furnace.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the quantities of various items in the agent's inventory.\n  - `position`: Position - Represents the coordinates of entities on the map.\n  - `fuel`: Inventory - Represents the fuel inventory for entities like drills and inserters."}
