# Agent Evaluation

!!! warning

    The codebase for evaluation is under development and is not yet stable. Use with caution,
    we welcome contributions.

Evaluation using any_agent.evaluation is designed to be a "trace-first" evaluation. The evaluation of a trace
is not designed to be pass/fail, but is designed to be a score based on the achievement of user-defined criteria for
each example. Agent systems are hyper-specific to each use case, and it's difficult to provide a single set of metrics
that would reliably provide the insight needed to make a decision about the effectiveness of an agent.

Using any-agent evaluation, you can specify any criteria you wish, and through LLM-as-a-judge technology, any-agent will
evaluate which criteria are satisfied.

## Example

Using the unified tracing format provided by any-agent's [tracing functionality](./tracing.md), the trace can be evaluated
with user defined criteria. The steps for evaluating an agent are as follows:

1. Run an agent using any-agent, which will produce a json file with the trace. For example

```python
from any_agent import AgentConfig, AnyAgent, TracingConfig
from any_agent.tools import search_web

agent = AnyAgent.create(
    "langchain",
    AgentConfig(
        model_id="gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=[search_web]
    ),
    tracing=TracingConfig(output_dir="traces")
)

agent.run("How many seconds would it take for a leopard at full speed to run through Pont des Arts?")
```
1. Define a test case in a yaml file, e.g.


~~~yaml
{% include "./examples/test_case.yaml" %}
~~~

1. Run the evaluation using the test case and trace.
```python
from any_agent.evaluation.test_case import TestCase
from any_agent.evaluation.evaluate import evaluate_telemetry
test_case = TestCase.from_yaml("./docs/examples/test_case.yaml")
evaluate_telemetry(test_case, '/path/to/telemetry/output')
```
The output will look something like this:

```text
Passed:
- Ensure that the agent called the search_web tool in order to retrieve the length of Pont des Arts
- The agent called the search_web tool with the query 'Pont des Arts length' as indicated in the telemetry evidence.

Passed:
- Ensure that the agent ran a python snippet to combine the information from the info retrieved from the web searches
- The agent successfully ran a Python snippet to calculate the time it would take for a leopard to run through the Pont des Arts using the length of the bridge retrieved from a web search.

Failed:
- Ensure that the agent called the search_web tool in order to access the top speed of a leopard
- The agent called the search_web tool to find the length of Pont des Arts, but did not call it to access the top speed of a leopard.

Failed:
- Check if Time is approximately '9.63'.
- The calculated time in the agent's answer is 9.62, not 9.63.

Failed:
- Is the answer a direct match?
- Partial Match (F1) score is 0.0
