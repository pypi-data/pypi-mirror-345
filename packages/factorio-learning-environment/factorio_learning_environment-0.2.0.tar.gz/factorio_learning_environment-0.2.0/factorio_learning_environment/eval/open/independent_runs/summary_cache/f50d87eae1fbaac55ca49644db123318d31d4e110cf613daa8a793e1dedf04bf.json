{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n- Additional wooden chests at positions (42.5, -83.5), (43.5, -83.5), and (44.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n\n### Coal-Fueled Stone Furnaces\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with a burner inserter at position (61.5, -55.5) for coal input.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with a burner inserter at position (64.5, -54.5) for coal input.\n- Wooden chest at position (61.5, -52.5) storing various items including stone bricks and coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the target location before attempting to place an entity. Remove any blocking objects like chests before placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to furnaces\n- Use an inserter to input items into a furnace instead of connecting belts directly. Ensure that belts are connected to inserters that can then input items into the furnace.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Used to place entities on the map. Ensure the target position is unoccupied and within a 10-unit range.\n- `connect_entities`: Used to connect entities like belts and inserters. Ensure correct usage by connecting belts to inserters rather than directly to furnaces.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inserter_1_position`: Position for placing inserter 1.\n- `belt_start_position`: Starting position for belt connections.\n- `alternative_inserter_1_position`: Alternative position for placing inserter 1 when the initial position is blocked."}
