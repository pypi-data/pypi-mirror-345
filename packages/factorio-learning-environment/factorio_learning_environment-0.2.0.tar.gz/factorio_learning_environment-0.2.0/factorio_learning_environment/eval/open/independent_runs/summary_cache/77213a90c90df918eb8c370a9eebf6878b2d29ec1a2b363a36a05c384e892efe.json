{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully built during these steps. Multiple attempts were made to craft and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but none succeeded due to missing inventory and insufficient sub-ingredients. \n\u2022 Although smelting operations were performed using existing furnaces (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron plate production and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production), no new permanent production facilities were created on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval \u2013 Several calls to get_entities() provided unexpected keyword arguments or too many positional arguments. Use the proper function signature and verify parameter names before calling.\n\u2022 Inventory checks before placement \u2013 Attempts to place a Lab failed because no lab item was available in inventory. Confirm that the required item exists before trying to place it.\n\u2022 Iterating over a None value \u2013 When filtering retrieved entities, a None value was encountered instead of an iterable list. Always validate that the returned value is iterable before processing.\n\u2022 Insufficient sub-ingredients for Lab crafting \u2013 Crafting errors repeatedly occurred due to missing intermediate products (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables). Verify the availability of all required resources and ensure production facilities (or smelting operations) are running adequately before initiating complex crafts.\n\u2022 Missing ingredient errors \u2013 One error cited missing iron-gear-wheel components even after some resource processing. Double-check the entire crafting chain and recipe requirements to preempt shortages."}
