{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore but frequently full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as staged storage for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, feeding chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt drop position remains unresolved, causing mining drill to wait for space.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and iron plate storage with improved inserter fueling and power connectivity, but output congestion persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles at (-4.5, -0.5), (0.5, 3.5), and others forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power but requires refueling of the boiler to maintain operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered but unable to craft due to lack of iron plates input.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) intended to supply iron plates.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest but waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and inserter logistics in place but remains starved of input materials.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt drop position\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked due to full furnace output inventory and blocked output belt.\n- To resolve, extend or clear the output belt and ensure downstream chests or belts have capacity to accept iron plates.\n- Regularly monitor furnace output and chest inventories to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Boiler fuel management and operational status\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is currently out of fuel, causing steam engine to rely on residual steam.\n- Maintain a steady supply of coal or other fuel to the boiler to ensure continuous steam power generation.\n- Implement automated inserter fueling or monitoring to avoid boiler downtime.\n\n### Inserter source item shortages and positioning\n- Burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) and output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) frequently wait for source items due to empty input inventories.\n- Assembling machine input chest at (21.5, 75.5) remains empty despite iron plates being inserted and extracted repeatedly, indicating possible logistic or timing issues.\n- Verify inserter positions and connections to ensure correct item flow from chests to assembling machine.\n- Consider increasing iron plate supply or buffering to maintain steady input.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Multiple failed attempts to place small electric poles near key entities (steam engine, mining drill, furnace, assembling machine) due to existing poles or drills occupying target tiles.\n- To avoid, check tile occupancy before placement and adjust spacing, direction, or reference position.\n- Plan pole placement with sufficient spacing to maintain power network connectivity without conflicts.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo new user-defined functions have been defined in the recent steps."}
