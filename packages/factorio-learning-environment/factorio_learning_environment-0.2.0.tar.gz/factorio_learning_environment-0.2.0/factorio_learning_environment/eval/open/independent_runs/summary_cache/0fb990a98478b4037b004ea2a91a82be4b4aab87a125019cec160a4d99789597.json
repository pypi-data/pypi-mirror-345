{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt. They are fueled with coal and have produced iron plates.\n- **Chests**: \n  - Iron chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Wooden chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5). It is out of fuel and has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Iron chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n  - Wooden chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional coal storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting resources\n- Ensure that the target chest or entity contains the expected resources before attempting extraction. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not find a valid wooden-chest entity containing iron-ore.\"\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Check the fuel status of entities before attempting to refuel them. This will avoid unnecessary actions like refueling an already fueled Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Regularly clear chests that are full to prevent interruptions in mining operations. This will ensure continuous production and resource gathering."}
