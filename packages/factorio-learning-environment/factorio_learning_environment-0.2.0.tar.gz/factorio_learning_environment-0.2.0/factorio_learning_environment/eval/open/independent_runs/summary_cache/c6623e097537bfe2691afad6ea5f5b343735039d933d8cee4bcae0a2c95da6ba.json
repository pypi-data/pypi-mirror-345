{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (17.5, 20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel'.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) which is currently working.\n- Pipe connections between these entities, including Pipe-to-Ground at position (16.5, 17.5) and multiple Pipe entities connecting the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=83084) at position (3.5, 17.5) with status 'EMPTY', consisting of pipes connecting various points.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=83095) at position (-9.5, 23.5) with status 'FULL_OUTPUT', carrying water and connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=211423) with poles located at various positions such as (27.5, 26.5), (10.5, 13.5), (1.5, 2.5), etc., but currently with voltage=0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that all entities intended to be connected, such as boilers and steam engines, are properly aligned and within the correct proximity to establish a connection. Verify that there are no missing or misplaced pipes that could interrupt the connection.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to ensure continuous operation. Keep a stock of fuel in the inventory and automate the refueling process if possible to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Monitor fluid systems to ensure that all necessary fluids are present and that there are no blockages or leaks in the pipe networks. Ensure that the offshore pump is correctly supplying water to the boiler and that the steam engine is receiving the necessary input liquid."}
