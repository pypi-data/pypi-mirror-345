{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) and a furnace at position(x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n\n### Electricity generator at position(x=111.5, y=-30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position x=117.5, y=-30.5), boiler(position x=111.5, y=-32.0) and offshore pump (position x=106.5, y=-32.5)\n\n### Offshore pump at position(x=106.5, y=-32.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position x=106.5, y=-32.5) and connected pipes\n\n### Boiler at position(x=111.5, y=-32.0)\nConsists of boiler (position x=111.5, y=-32.0) and connected pipes\n\n### Electricity distribution at position(x=111.5, y=-30.5)\nConsists of small electric poles at positions (x=111.5, y=-30.5), (x=115.5, y=-30.5), (x=111.5, y=-27.5), (x=120.5, y=-26.5), (x=115.5, y=-32.5), (x=112.5, y=-24.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n- Ensure that the correct number of arguments are passed to the function. The function takes 3 positional arguments.\n- Ensure that the positions passed to the function are of the correct type. The function expects integer positions, not floats.\n\n### Errors when accessing entity positions\n- Ensure that the entity position is accessed correctly. The position attribute of an entity is a Position object, not a float.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* connect_entities: function to connect two entities with a transport belt\n\t+ Failure modes: incorrect number of arguments, incorrect type of positions\n\t+ Success modes: entities connected with a transport belt\n* move_to: function to move the agent to a position\n\t+ Failure modes: incorrect position type\n\t+ Success modes: agent moved to the position\n* craft_item: function to craft an item\n\t+ Failure modes: incorrect item type\n\t+ Success modes: item crafted\n* Important variables:\n\t+ drill_entity: BurnerMiningDrill entity\n\t+ furnace_entity: Furnace entity\n\t+ transport_belt: TransportBelt prototype\n\t+ positions: Position objects representing entity positions\n\t+ inventory: dictionary representing the agent's inventory"}
