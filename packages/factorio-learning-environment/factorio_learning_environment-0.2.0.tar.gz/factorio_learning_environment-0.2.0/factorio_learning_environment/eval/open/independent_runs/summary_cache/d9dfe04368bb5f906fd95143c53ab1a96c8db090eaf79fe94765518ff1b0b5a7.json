{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and Furnace at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0), both with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) and a series of transport belts.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) connected to a Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) for storage of iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) connected to a Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-20.5, y=-63.5) for storage.\n- Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) and a series of transport belts.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) connected to the transport belt system.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Processing\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected between two wooden chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with Object Attributes\n- Ensure that the objects being manipulated have the necessary attributes. For example, a 'Chest' object does not have an 'outputs' attribute. Verify the object type and its attributes before attempting to use them.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- When connecting entities such as transport belts, ensure that the positions are valid and the entities can be connected. Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the entities are within a connectable range.\n- Ensure that the entities being connected are compatible and that there are no nil values or uninitialized fields in the connection logic."}
