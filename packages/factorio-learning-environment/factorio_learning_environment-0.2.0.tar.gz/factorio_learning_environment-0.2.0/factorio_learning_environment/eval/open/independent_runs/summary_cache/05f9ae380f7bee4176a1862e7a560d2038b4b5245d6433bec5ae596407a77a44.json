{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal. This drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5). The chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) contains iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers items from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal. It processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which is currently waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, the error `NameError: name 'plate_inserter' is not defined` suggests that the variable `plate_inserter` was used without being initialized.\n\n### Errors when Attempting to Insert Items without Inventory\n- Verify that the required items are present in the inventory before attempting to insert them. The error `Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory` indicates a lack of coal in the inventory at the time of insertion.\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Non-existent or Empty Entities\n- Confirm the existence and content of entities before attempting extraction. The error `Could not extract iron-ore from wooden-chest at (-14.5, -48.5): Could not find a valid wooden-chest entity containing iron-ore` suggests attempting to extract from an empty or non-existent chest.\n\n### Furnace Fuel and Ingredient Management\n- Ensure the furnace is adequately fueled and has the necessary ingredients for processing. The message `Furnace is missing ingredients or fuel` indicates a lack of either fuel or iron ore, preventing the production of iron plates.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Regularly empty chests to prevent mining operations from halting. The warning `chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining` indicates that the chest is full, which stops the mining drill from operating."}
