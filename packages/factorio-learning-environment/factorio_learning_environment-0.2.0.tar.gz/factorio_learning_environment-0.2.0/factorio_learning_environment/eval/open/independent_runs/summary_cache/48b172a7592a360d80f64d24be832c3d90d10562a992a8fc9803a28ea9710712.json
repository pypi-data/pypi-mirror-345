{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-2.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting steam engine and boiler (positions include: (-4.5, 16.5), (-5.5, 16.5), (-2.5, 17.5), ..., (-2.5, 21.5), (-2.5, 20.5), (-2.5, 22.5))\n- Pipe Group connecting offshore pump and boiler (positions include: (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), ..., (-5.5, 23.5), (-4.5, 23.5), (-4.5, 24.5))\n- Electricity Group with Small Electric Poles at positions (-7.5, 22.5), (-6.5, 22.5), and (-1.5, 20.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities or place new ones. For example, ensure you have enough pipes and small electric poles before attempting to connect or place them.\n\n### Errors in connecting entities\n- Verify that all entities you intend to connect are compatible and that you have the necessary items in your inventory to facilitate the connection. For instance, ensure that pipes are available and correctly placed to connect the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors due to missing fuel or ingredients\n- Regularly check that all machines have the necessary fuel or ingredients to operate. For example, ensure that the boiler has coal and the furnace has the necessary smelting ingredients.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Entity Status\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly connected and powered. For example, verify that the steam engine is properly connected and receiving steam from the boiler."}
