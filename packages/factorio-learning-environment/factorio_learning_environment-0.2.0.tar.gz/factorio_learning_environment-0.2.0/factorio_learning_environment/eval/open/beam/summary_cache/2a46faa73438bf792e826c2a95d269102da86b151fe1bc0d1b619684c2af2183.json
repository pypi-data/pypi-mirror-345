{"content": "It seems there was no output or confirmation after the movement command to Position(-5, -5). This could indicate that the command was either executed successfully without any issues or that there was an error that wasn't reported.\n\n### Summary of Actions and Errors:\n1. **Initial Placement Attempt**: The attempt to place the stone furnace at (-14, -14) failed because the distance exceeded the maximum allowable placement distance (10 units).\n2. **Movement to Origin**: Successfully moved to the origin (0, 0).\n3. **Nearest Resource Confirmation**: Successfully confirmed the nearest stone position as (-14.5, -14.5).\n4. **Movement to Intermediate Position**: Attempted to move to (-5, -5) but received no confirmation or error message.\n\n### Tips and Logic Patterns to Avoid Errors in Future:\n1. **Movement Confirmation**: Always check for confirmation after movement commands. If no output is received, consider implementing a check to verify the current player position.\n2. **Incremental Movement**: Instead of attempting to move directly to a distant resource, break down movements into smaller increments to ensure you remain within the allowable distance for placing entities.\n3. **Entity Placement Checks**: Before placing any entity, check the distance from the current player position to the target position. If the distance exceeds the maximum placement distance, adjust your movement strategy accordingly.\n4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling that provides feedback on the success or failure of commands, especially for critical actions like placing entities.\n5. **Resource Navigation**: If the player position is not updating as expected, consider re-evaluating the movement commands or the environment state to ensure that the commands are being processed correctly.\n\nBy following these patterns, you can enhance the reliability of your actions within the Factorio environment and reduce the likelihood of encountering similar issues in the future.", "summary_range": "[1-166]"}
