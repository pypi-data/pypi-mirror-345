{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. All attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and inserters have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using incorrect data types for movement\n- Ensure that when using the `move_to` function, the indices are integers. Avoid using strings as indices for positions.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Before attempting to place an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and valid for placement. This includes checking the size and position of the BuildingBox.\n\n### Errors with callable objects\n- Ensure that objects like 'Position' are not mistakenly treated as callable functions. Use them correctly as data structures to store coordinates.\n\n### Errors with placement due to incorrect positioning\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure they are within valid and accessible areas on the map. Avoid placing entities at positions that are not feasible due to map constraints or existing obstacles."}
