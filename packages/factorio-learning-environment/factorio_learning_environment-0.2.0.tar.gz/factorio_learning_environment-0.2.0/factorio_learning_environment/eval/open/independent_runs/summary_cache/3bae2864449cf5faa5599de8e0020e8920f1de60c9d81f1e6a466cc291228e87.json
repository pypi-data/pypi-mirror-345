{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position(41.5, -80.5)) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position(41.0, -82.0)) which is currently working and requires coal as fuel.\n\n### Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position(-15.0, -50.0)) which is currently working but has no ingredients to smelt. It processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when extracting from a chest that is full**\n  - Ensure to empty the wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) to continue mining with the burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0).\n\n- **Errors when inserting into the furnace with no ingredients**\n  - Make sure to have the necessary ingredients available before attempting to insert them into the furnace at (-15.0, -50.0).\n\n- **Errors when using the burner mining drill without sufficient fuel**\n  - Always check the fuel status of the burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) and ensure it is adequately fueled with coal.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `coal: int` - Total amount of coal in inventory.\n  - `iron-ore: int` - Total amount of iron ore in inventory.\n  - `iron-plate: int` - Total amount of iron plates in inventory.\n  - `wood: int` - Total amount of wood in inventory."}
