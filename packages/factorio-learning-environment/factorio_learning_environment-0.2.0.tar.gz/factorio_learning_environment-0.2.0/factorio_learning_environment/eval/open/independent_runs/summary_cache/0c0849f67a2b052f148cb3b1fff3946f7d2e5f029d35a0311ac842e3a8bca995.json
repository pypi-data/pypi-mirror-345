{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace 1 at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) and Furnace 2 at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n- Multiple burner inserters at positions (x=-13.5, y=-47.5), (x=-14.5, y=-45.5), (x=-9.5, y=-44.5), (x=-14.5, y=-43.5), and (x=-11.5, y=-45.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) and iron chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5)\n- Transport belts connecting various entities, including a belt group from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5), and from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5)\n\n### Electricity Generation Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5)\n- Steam engine at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe group connecting these entities, with pipes at positions (x=-8.5, y=21.5), (x=-7.5, y=21.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-8.5, y=23.5), and (x=-8.5, y=22.5)\n- Electricity poles forming an electricity network with poles at various positions including (x=-9.5, y=-33.5), (x=-9.5, y=-29.5), (x=-9.5, y=-37.5), (x=-9.5, y=14.5), (x=-6.5, y=19.5), and (x=-4.5, y=25.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Inserter Blockage\n- Ensure that the output path of inserters is clear and there is a destination entity to accept the output. This will prevent inserters from being blocked.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are within a reasonable distance. Move closer to the target entities if necessary to establish a connection.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities at a Distance\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into a structure, ensure that you have the required items in your inventory to avoid insertion errors."}
