{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-3.5, -0.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position (-3.5, -0.5)), boiler(position (-6.5, 0.0)) and offshore pump (position (-9.5, -0.5))\n\n### Iron ore mine at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill(position (15.5, 70.5)) and a chest at position(15.5, 72.5)\n\n### Copper ore mine at position(-45.5, 70.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill(position (-45.5, 70.5)) and a chest at position(-45.5, 72.5)\n\n### Iron smelter at position(16.0, 75.0)\nConsists of stone furnace(position (16.0, 75.0)) and an inserter at position(14.5, 75.5)\n\n### Copper smelter at position(-45.0, 75.0)\nConsists of stone furnace(position (-45.0, 75.0)) and an inserter at position(-46.5, 75.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n- Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction when placing entities next to existing ones.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a chest object as a source. Add an inserter that takes items from the chest and use the inserter as a source entity.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and inserter have sufficient fuel.\n- Ensure that furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs. Hence, this section is not included."}
