{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=-5.5, y=19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-2.5, y=24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the boiler and steam engine, starting at position (x=-5.5, y=16.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump and boiler, starting at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5)\n- **Small Electric Poles** at positions (x=-7.5, y=22.5) and (x=-6.5, y=22.5), connecting the steam engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure you have all required ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For instance, crafting pipes requires iron plates, and crafting small electric poles requires wood and copper cables.\n\n### Connection Errors Due to Missing Items\n- Verify you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, connecting pipes requires having pipes in your inventory.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Missing Items\n- Ensure the item you wish to place is available in your inventory. For instance, placing a small electric pole requires having it in your inventory.\n\n### Fuel Insertion Errors\n- Make sure you have the required fuel in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a furnace or boiler.\n\n### Entity Status Errors\n- Regularly check the status of entities to ensure they are working as expected. For example, a steam engine not working might indicate a connection issue or lack of input liquid."}
