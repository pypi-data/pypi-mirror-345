{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) for storing items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to prevent idle inserters.\n\n### No Iron Plates Available in Input Chest\n- Ensure that iron plates are being produced and transferred to the input chest. Monitor the production rate and adjust the supply of raw materials as necessary.\n\n### Errors When Refueling\n- Ensure that you have sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Harvest or craft additional fuel if necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Belt Blockage\n- Ensure that the destination for items being transferred by inserters is not blocked. Clear any obstructions or adjust the layout to allow smooth item flow.\n\n### Insufficient Coal for Furnace\n- Maintain a steady supply of coal in your inventory to refuel furnaces and mining drills. Regularly check coal reserves and harvest additional coal as needed."}
