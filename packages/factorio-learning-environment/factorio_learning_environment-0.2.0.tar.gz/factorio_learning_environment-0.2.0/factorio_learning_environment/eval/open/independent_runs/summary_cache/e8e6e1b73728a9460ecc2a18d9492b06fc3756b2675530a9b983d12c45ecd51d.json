Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore, Iron Plate\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure the furnace is adequately fueled and has a consistent supply of iron ore to process into iron plates. Regularly check the furnace's inventory and status to ensure it is operational.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and fueled to transfer items between entities. Ensure inserters have a clear path and sufficient fuel to operate continuously.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Consider expanding storage capacity or more frequently transferring items to other entities or storage solutions.\n\n### Errors in Mining Drill Operation\n- Ensure mining drills are continuously fueled and that their drop positions are not obstructed by full chests. Regularly clear out mined resources to maintain efficient operation."}
