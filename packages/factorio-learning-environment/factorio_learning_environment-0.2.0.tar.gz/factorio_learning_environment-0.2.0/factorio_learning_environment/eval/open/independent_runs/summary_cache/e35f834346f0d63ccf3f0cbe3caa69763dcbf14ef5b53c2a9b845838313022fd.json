{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and Steam Engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe Network starting at Position (5.5, -8.5)\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (24.5, -7.5), (-3.5, 3.5), (-2.5, 2.5), etc.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the pipe network is correctly connected from the offshore pump to the boiler. Check for any gaps or incorrect pipe placements that might be preventing water flow.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that the inserter is connected to the electricity network and that there is power available. Check the connections between the inserter and the small electric poles.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Confirm that the steam engine is connected to a boiler with a sufficient supply of water. Ensure the pipe connections are correct and there are no blockages."}
