{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities working together to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and store the output:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), facing down, extracting iron ore from the patch at approximately (15.5, 70.5).\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5), collecting iron plates from the furnace output.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5), facing down, transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5), facing right, moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n\nThis integrated structure is fueled primarily by coal inserted into the drill, furnace, and inserters to maintain operation. The entities are positioned closely to facilitate efficient item transfer.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- When placing inserters next to other entities, ensure the target tile is free. For example, placing a burner inserter next to the furnace at (16.0, 73.0) with spacing 0 and direction right failed because the wooden chest at (17.5, 73.5) occupied the tile.\n- To avoid this, increase spacing, change the direction of placement, or adjust the reference position to find a free adjacent tile.\n\n### Inserters waiting due to blocked output or lack of sink entities\n- Inserters transferring items may become stuck waiting for space in the destination or source items if the output is blocked or no sink entity exists to accept items.\n- Ensure that the output inserter has a valid destination entity or chest to receive items to prevent blockage.\n- Confirm that the input inserter has source items available to pick up; otherwise, it will wait indefinitely.\n\n### Fuel management for continuous operation\n- Entities such as burner mining drills, furnaces, and burner inserters require coal to operate. Lack of fuel causes status errors like NO_FUEL.\n- Consistently insert fuel into these entities to maintain operation and avoid stoppages.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
