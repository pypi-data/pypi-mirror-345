{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler and Boiler to Steam Engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal fuel\n\n### Research Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation-science-pack\n- Connected to electricity via small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, 'copper_cable_needed_for_poles' was not defined.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected between entities. Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to complete connections.\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Status\n- Check the status of entities such as steam engines and ensure they are working. If not, verify connections and fuel levels.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities, such as copper ore into a furnace.\n\n### Errors in Lab Operations\n- Ensure that the lab is correctly positioned and connected to power. Verify that the lab exists at the specified position before attempting operations.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Resources\n- Regularly check resource levels, such as coal, to ensure continuous operation of boilers and other fuel-dependent entities.\n\n### Assertion Errors in Code\n- Use assertions to verify that entities are in the expected state, but ensure the conditions for these assertions are met to avoid unexpected errors."}
