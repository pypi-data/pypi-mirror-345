{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully built on the map. Multiple recovery steps attempted to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but the Lab was never crafted or placed due to inventory shortages and cascading resource deficiencies. Although operations referenced furnaces (an alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) for smelting processes, these were pre\u2010existing or retrieved for processing and were not newly created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Parameters \u2013 When using get_entities, ensure the call adheres to the correct parameter signature. Remove unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) and avoid supplying unexpected positional arguments.\n\u2022 Lab Retrieval and Placement \u2013 Before attempting placement, verify that a Lab entity exists in the inventory. When retrieving Lab entities, check for valid, iterable results and implement fallbacks to handle potential None values.\n\u2022 Crafting and Resource Dependencies \u2013 Lab crafting errors consistently stem from missing sub-ingredients such as iron-gear-wheels and electronic circuits. Confirm that every step in the production chain (including precursor items like copper-cable and copper-plate) is adequately supplied to avoid cascading failures during crafting."}
