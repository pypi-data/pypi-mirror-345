{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15, -50) targeting iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-13.5, -50.5)\n- Input burner inserter at (-14.5, -51.5)\n- Output burner inserter at (-12.5, -50.5)\n- Connected to transport belt system\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (38, -83)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (38, -83) targeting coal\n- Wooden chest at (39.5, -83.5)\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -83.5)\n- Connected to transport belt system\n\n### Dual Furnace Smelting System at (46-51, -80)\nConsists of:\n- First furnace line:\n  - Stone furnace at (46, -80)\n  - Input burner inserter at (46.5, -82.5)\n  - Output burner inserter at (46.5, -81.5)\n- Second furnace line:\n  - Stone furnace at (51, -80)\n  - Input burner inserter at (51.5, -82.5)\n  - Output burner inserter at (51.5, -81.5)\n- Storage chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Complex belt system connecting mining operations to furnaces\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nMultiple belt groups connecting:\n- Mining operations to furnaces\n- Coal and iron ore distribution system\n- Output collection system\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities when placing multiple furnaces\n- Check for existing entities before placing new structures\n- Verify terrain is suitable (not water) before placing entities\n- When connecting entities with belts, ensure there is a valid path between start and end points\n- Clear blocking entities before attempting to place new structures\n- Maintain proper alignment when placing related entities (inserters, furnaces, belts)\n\nNAMESPACE\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails if location is blocked or invalid\n- connect_entities(): Creates belt connections between entities. Fails if path is invalid\n- clear_entities(): Removes entities from specified locations\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace1, furnace2: Stone furnace entities\n- input_inserter1, input_inserter2: Burner inserter entities for input\n- output_inserter1, output_inserter2: Burner inserter entities for output\n- belts: Transport belt groups connecting various structures"}
