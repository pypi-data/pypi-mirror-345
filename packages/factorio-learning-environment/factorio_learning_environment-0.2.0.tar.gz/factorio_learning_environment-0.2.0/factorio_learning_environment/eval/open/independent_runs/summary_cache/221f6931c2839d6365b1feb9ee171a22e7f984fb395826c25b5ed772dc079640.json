{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with a full fuel inventory of coal and a status indicating no ingredients to smelt. It has produced 21 iron plates so far.\n\n### Pipe Network at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n- Consists of a series of pipes connecting various points: (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5). The system is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Consists of several electric poles positioned at: (x=-1.5, y=21.5), (x=-0.5, y=21.5), (x=-1.5, y=20.5), ..., (x=-3.5, y=20.5), (x=-3.5, y=21.5), (x=-7.5, y=19.5). The network is currently without voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure that the position selected for placing an offshore pump is suitable and adjacent to a water source. Repeated attempts to place the pump at unsuitable positions indicate a need for better site selection.\n\n### Errors in Boiler Placement\n- Verify that the chosen position for placing a boiler is suitable and unoccupied. Multiple failed attempts suggest checking the terrain and ensuring the area is clear before placement.\n\n### Connection Errors Between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Misalignment or incorrect connections can prevent successful setup.\n\n### Errors in Electric Pole Placement\n- Check that electric poles are placed in a manner that allows for proper connection and coverage. Placement issues can disrupt the electricity network, leading to inefficiencies.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended structure to avoid placement failures."}
