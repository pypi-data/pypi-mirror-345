{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully established on the map. Although there were multiple attempts to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) and to craft one for research purposes, none were placed. The operations involving furnaces (at positions (5.0, 5.0) and (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were used for processing resources rather than for constructing a dedicated production structure.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Consistency:\n  \u2013 When using get_entities, match the function\u2019s signature exactly. Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (such as 'radius') or an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Verification:\n  \u2013 Always verify that the Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map. A missing Lab in inventory leads to placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Management:\n  \u2013 Ensure all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) are available in the needed quantities before initiating Lab crafting. Shortages in any one component will cause the crafting process to fail.\n  \n\u2022 Handling Entity Retrieval:\n  \u2013 When filtering or iterating over retrieved entities, confirm that the function returns a valid list (or an empty list) rather than None. This avoids errors such as trying to iterate over a NoneType object."}
