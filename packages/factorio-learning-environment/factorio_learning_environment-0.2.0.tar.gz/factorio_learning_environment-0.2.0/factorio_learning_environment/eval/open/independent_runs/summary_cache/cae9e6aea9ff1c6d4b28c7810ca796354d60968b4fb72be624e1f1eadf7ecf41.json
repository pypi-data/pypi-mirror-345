{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) and another at (x=54.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items between chests at (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Ore Processing at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=5.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=1.5, y=1.5) to (x=3.5, y=1.5) and (x=2.5, y=1.5) to (x=4.5, y=1.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=3.5, y=2.5) to (x=5.5, y=2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using non-callable objects\n- Ensure that the object you are trying to use as a function is indeed callable. In the logs, a 'Chest' object was attempted to be called as a function, which is incorrect. Verify the object type before using it as a function.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory in destination chests\n- Regularly check and empty destination chests to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full inventory. For example, the chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) is full, causing the connected burner mining drill to stop.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as burner mining drills, have a sufficient fuel supply to continue operations. The burner mining drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) is out of fuel.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. The furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and others have warnings about missing ingredients.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items to prevent them from idling. Several inserters are waiting for source items, as indicated in the logs."}
