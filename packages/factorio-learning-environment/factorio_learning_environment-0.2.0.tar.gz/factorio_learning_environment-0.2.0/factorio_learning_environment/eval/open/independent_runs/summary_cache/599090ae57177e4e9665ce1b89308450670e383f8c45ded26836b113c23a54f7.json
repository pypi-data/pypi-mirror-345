{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of:\n- Small electric pole at position (13.5, 10.5) providing power to the lab.\n\n### Small Electric Poles\nConsists of:\n- Small electric pole at position (6.5, 0.5) providing additional power.\n- Small electric pole at position (13.5, 10.5) connected to the lab.\n- Small electric pole at position (16.5, 10.5) providing additional power.\n- Small electric pole at position (20.5, 10.5) providing additional power.\n\n### Furnaces\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) - Status: Working, Fuel: Coal (11).\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) - Status: No Ingredients, Fuel: Coal (8).\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 2.0) - Status: No Ingredients, Fuel: Coal (20).\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Contains iron plates (200).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before attempting to place a small electric pole. Check for suitable positions before placing.\n\n### Errors when searching for power sources\n- Verify that the required power sources (e.g., steam engines, solar panels) are present on the map before attempting to connect to them. If they are not found, consider building them nearby.\n\n### Errors when inventory is empty\n- Ensure you have the required entities in your inventory before attempting to place them. Check your inventory count before placing any structure.\n\n### Errors when the lab has no power\n- Make sure to connect the lab to a power source. If the lab status indicates no power, check the connections to the nearest electric poles and ensure they are functional."}
