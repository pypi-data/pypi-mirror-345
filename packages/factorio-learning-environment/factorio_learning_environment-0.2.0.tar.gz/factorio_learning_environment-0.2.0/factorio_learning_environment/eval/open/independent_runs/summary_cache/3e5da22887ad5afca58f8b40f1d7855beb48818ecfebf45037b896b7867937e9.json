{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation System\n- **Components:**\n  - **Steam Engine** at position (17.5, 20.5) and (7.5, 23.5)\n  - **Boiler** at position (0.5, 23.0)\n  - **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n  - **Pipe Network** connecting various components\n- **Status:**\n  - Steam engines are not connected to the electric network.\n  - Offshore pump and boiler are operational but not effectively connected to the steam engines.\n\n### Copper Smelting Facility at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- **Components:**\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- **Functionality:**\n  - Used for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n  - Currently contains copper plates and coal as fuel.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure all required raw materials, such as wood and copper plates, are gathered before attempting to craft.\n- Copper plates need to be smelted in a furnace; ensure a furnace is available and operational for crafting copper cables.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Fluid Systems\n- Verify that the pipe network is correctly set up to connect the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine.\n- Ensure all necessary pipes and underground pipes are placed correctly to establish a connection.\n\n### Errors in Locating Stone Furnaces\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is placed and recognized on the map before attempting to locate it programmatically.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `craft_item`: Used to craft items; failed due to missing raw materials.\n- `nearest`: Used to find the nearest entity; failed due to the absence of the entity on the map.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace_position`: Position of the stone furnace, used for smelting operations.\n- `boiler_fluid_systems`: Keeps track of the fluid system connected to the boiler.\n- `offshore_pump_fluid_systems`: Keeps track of the fluid system connected to the offshore pump.\n- `steam_engine_status`: Indicates the operational status of the steam engines."}
