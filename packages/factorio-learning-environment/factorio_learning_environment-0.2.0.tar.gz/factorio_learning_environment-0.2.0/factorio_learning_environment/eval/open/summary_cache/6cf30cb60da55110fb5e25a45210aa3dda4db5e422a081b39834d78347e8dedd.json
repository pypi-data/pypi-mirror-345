{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently without power and output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full input and output inventories.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates, with frequent iron plate transfers between them.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, frequently accessed for input and output.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational, moving iron plates between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace drop position persists, preventing smooth output flow and causing mining drill to lose power.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with active coal fueling and frequent material transfers, though output belt blockage and power loss at the mining drill remain unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), not connected to power network and lacking input fluid, currently not generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5), but no active power connection to steam engine.\n\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity from steam power but is currently non-operational due to lack of fuel in boiler and no power network connection for the steam engine.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), currently without power connection and with full input inventory of iron plates but no output items produced.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) frequently supplying iron plates to the assembler.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), empty despite assembler activity.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational but waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine repeatedly shows input inventory full of iron plates but no iron gear wheels produced, indicating crafting is stalled due to lack of power.\n\nThis structure is designed for iron gear wheel production and has sufficient input materials and inserter fueling, but remains non-functional due to missing power connection and no output flow.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage causing mining drill power loss\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) repeatedly reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" preventing output flow.\n- This blockage causes the mining drill to lose power and stop mining.\n- To fix this, clear or extend the output belts and chests connected to the furnace to ensure continuous item flow.\n- Verify that inserters and belts downstream are not full or jammed.\n\n### Steam power structure non-operational due to fuel and connectivity issues\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, causing it to stop producing steam.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) is not connected to the power network and has no input fluid, preventing power generation.\n- Ensure the boiler is continuously fueled with coal.\n- Connect the steam engine properly to the electric network with poles and verify fluid pipe connections to supply steam.\n\n### Assembling machine stalled due to lack of power and output flow\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) has full input inventory of iron plates but no output iron gear wheels.\n- The assembler is not powered, preventing crafting operations.\n- Output chest at (25.5, 82.5) remains empty, and output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) is waiting for source items.\n- Connect the assembler to the power network using electric poles.\n- Ensure output inserters and chests are ready to accept crafted items to avoid output blockage.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management stable but monitor continuously\n- Burner inserters at (20."}
