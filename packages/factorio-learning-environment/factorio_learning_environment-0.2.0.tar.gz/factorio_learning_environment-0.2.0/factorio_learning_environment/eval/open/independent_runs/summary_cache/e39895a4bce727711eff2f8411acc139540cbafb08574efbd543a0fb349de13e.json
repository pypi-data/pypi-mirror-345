{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe Group (fluid system=104892) connecting various positions from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n- Pipe Group (fluid system=104903) carrying water from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions [(x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), ..., (x=26.5, y=17.5), (x=30.5, y=17.5), (x=20.5, y=19.5)]\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected to the intended entities. Verify the connection points and ensure that the pipes are not obstructed or misplaced.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
