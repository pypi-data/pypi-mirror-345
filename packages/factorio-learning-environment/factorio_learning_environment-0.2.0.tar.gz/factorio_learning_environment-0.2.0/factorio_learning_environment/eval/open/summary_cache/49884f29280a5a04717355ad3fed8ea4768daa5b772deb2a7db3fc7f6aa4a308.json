{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently without power and output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and working, but frequently full output inventory causing smelting stoppage.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates; these chests are currently empty.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) also empty, with burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational feeding the chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace drop position remains unresolved, causing mining drill to be unpowered and blocked.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with inserters fueled and power poles connected, but output blockage and power issues persist.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water, working normally.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) not connected to power network and lacking input fluid, thus not generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5) present but power network connection incomplete.\n\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity from steam power but is currently non-functional due to boiler fuel depletion and steam engine disconnection.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), currently not receiving power and unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) empty, previously used to feed iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) empty.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational but waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine input and output inventories empty, no iron gear wheels produced.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production but currently inactive due to lack of power and input materials.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage causing mining drill stoppage\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked due to the furnace output belt at (18.0, 75.0) being full.\n- This causes the drill to lose power and stop mining.\n- To resolve, clear or extend the output belt and ensure chests or belts downstream can accept smelted iron plates to prevent furnace output inventory from filling up.\n\n### Power network disconnection and fuel depletion in steam power structure\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, stopping steam production.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) is not connected to the power network and lacks input fluid, preventing power generation.\n- Ensure continuous fuel supply to boilers and proper electric pole placement to connect steam engines to the power grid.\n- Verify pipe connections to supply water and steam correctly.\n\n### Assembling machine inactivity due to power and input shortages\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) is not receiving power and has no iron plates in input inventory.\n- Output chest and inserters are empty or waiting for source items.\n- Supply sufficient iron plates to the input chest and ensure the assembling machine is connected to the power network.\n- Clear output paths to allow assembled items to be moved out.\n\n### Extraction errors from empty chests\n- Attempted extraction of iron plates from wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) failed due to chest being empty.\n- Before extracting, verify the chest contains the required items to avoid exceptions.\n- Implement checks for inventory contents prior to extraction commands.\n\n### Entity placement and inserter fuel management (from previous report)\n- Continue verifying tile occupancy before placing entities to avoid placement conflicts.\n- Burner inserters"}
