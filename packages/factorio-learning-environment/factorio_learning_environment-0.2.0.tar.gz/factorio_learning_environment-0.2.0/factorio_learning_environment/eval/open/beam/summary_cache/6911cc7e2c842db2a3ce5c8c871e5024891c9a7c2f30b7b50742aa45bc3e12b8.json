{"content": "The error indicates that the furnace inventory is full, preventing the insertion of coal. To resolve this, we need to free up space in the furnace's inventory. Here's how you can address this:\n\n1. **Extract Excess Items**: Since the furnace is full, we need to extract some items to make room for coal.\n\n2. **Prioritize Extraction**: Start by extracting any excess copper ore or other items that are not currently needed for smelting.\n\n3. **Re-insert Coal**: Once space is available, insert the necessary amount of coal to ensure the furnace can operate.\n\nHere's the updated approach:\n\n```python\n# Confirm the furnace entity and its current inventory\nfurnace = next((entity for entity in get_entities() if entity.name == \"stone-furnace\" and entity.position == Position(x=5.0, y=5.0)), None)\nassert furnace, \"Stone Furnace is not located at the expected position.\"\n\n# Check the current inventory of the furnace\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nprint(\"Current Furnace Inventory:\", furnace_inventory)\n\n# Extract excess copper ore or other items to free up space\nexcess_ore_quantity = furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0) - 5  # Keep a buffer of 5 copper ore\nif excess_ore_quantity > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace.position, excess_ore_quantity)\n    print(f\"Extracted {excess_ore_quantity} excess copper ore from the furnace.\")\n\n# Check if there are other items that can be extracted\n# Extract any iron plates or other non-essential items\nif 'iron-plate' in furnace_inventory:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, furnace_inventory['iron-plate'])\n    print(\"Extracted iron plates to free up space.\")\n\n# Insert coal now that there is space\ncoal_to_add = 5 - furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\nif coal_to_add > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=coal_to_add)\n    print(f\"Inserted {coal_to_add} coal into furnace to ensure it can smelt.\")\n\n# Allow the furnace time to smelt resources\nsleep(10)\n\n# Check if copper plates have been produced now\nfurnace_inventory_after_processing = inspect_inventory(furnace)\ncopper_plates_produced = furnace_inventory_after_processing.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\nprint(\"Updated Furnace Inventory:\", furnace_inventory_after_processing)\n\n# Extract copper plates if available\nif copper_plates_produced > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, furnace.position, copper_plates_produced)\n    craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable)\n\n# Now, attempt crafting the small electric pole after ensuring copper cables are produced\ncrafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nassert crafted_poles > 0, \"Failed to craft a small electric pole.\"\n\n# Place the small electric pole\npole_position = Position(x=4.0, y=3.0)\ntry:\n    electric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, pole_position)\n    assert electric_pole, \"Failed to place the small electric pole.\"\n    print(\"Electric pole successfully placed; power setup complete.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred while placing the pole: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Inventory Management**: Ensure that the furnace has enough space by extracting unnecessary items.\n- **Resource Prioritization**: Focus on maintaining a balance of resources that are actively needed for the smelting process.\n- **Error Handling**: Use print statements to track the process and identify where adjustments are needed.", "summary_range": "[1-156]"}
