{"content": "It seems like the output is not showing any further details beyond the initial print statement. This suggests that the code might not be executing beyond the initial setup, possibly due to an issue with how the environment is handling the commands or the way the print statements are being captured.\n\nLet's try a more step-by-step approach with additional checks and logging to ensure each part of the process is being executed and logged correctly:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting detailed setup process.\")\n\ntry:\n    # Step 1: Verify and Connect Power to Assembling Machine\n    assembling_machine_position = Position(x=4.5, y=0.5)\n    print(f\"Checking power connection for assembling machine at {assembling_machine_position}.\")\n\n    # Check for existing electric poles\n    nearby_electric_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole}, assembling_machine_position, radius=10)\n    if nearby_electric_poles:\n        electric_pole = nearby_electric_poles[0]\n        print(f\"Found existing electric pole at {electric_pole.position}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No electric pole found. Crafting and placing a new one.\")\n        craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, 1)\n        electric_pole_position = Position(x=3.0, y=0.5)\n        electric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=electric_pole_position)\n        print(f\"Placed new electric pole at {electric_pole_position}.\")\n\n    # Attempt to connect the electric pole to the assembling machine\n    connected_entities = connect_entities(electric_pole, assembling_machine_position)\n    if connected_entities:\n        print(\"Successfully connected electric pole to assembling machine.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to connect electric pole to assembling machine.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Extract Copper Plates from Furnace\n    furnace_position = Position(x=0.0, y=0.0)\n    move_to(furnace_position)\n    print(f\"Moved to furnace at {furnace_position}.\")\n\n    # Inspect furnace inventory\n    furnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_position)\n    copper_plates_available = furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\n    print(f\"Furnace inventory: {furnace_inventory}\")\n\n    if copper_plates_available > 0:\n        extracted_plates = extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, furnace_position, copper_plates_available)\n        print(f\"Extracted {extracted_plates} copper plates from furnace.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No copper plates available in furnace.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Insert Copper Plates into Assembling Machine\n    move_to(assembling_machine_position)\n    print(f\"Moved to assembling machine at {assembling_machine_position}.\")\n\n    if copper_plates_available > 0:\n        insert_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, assembling_machine_position, extracted_plates)\n        print(f\"Inserted {extracted_plates} copper plates into the assembling machine.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No copper plates to insert into assembling machine.\")\n\nexcept Exception as error:\n    print(f\"Error during setup process: {error}\")\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n- **Incremental Logging**: Added more print statements to track the progress and verify each step.\n- **Conditional Checks**: Ensured that each action is only attempted if the prerequisites are met (e.g., checking for copper plates before extraction).\n- **Error Handling**: Wrapped the entire process in a try-except block to catch and report any errors.\n\nThis approach should help identify where the process might be failing or stopping prematurely. If the output still doesn't show detailed execution, it might be necessary to verify the environment setup or check for any restrictions on command execution.", "summary_range": "[1-330]"}
