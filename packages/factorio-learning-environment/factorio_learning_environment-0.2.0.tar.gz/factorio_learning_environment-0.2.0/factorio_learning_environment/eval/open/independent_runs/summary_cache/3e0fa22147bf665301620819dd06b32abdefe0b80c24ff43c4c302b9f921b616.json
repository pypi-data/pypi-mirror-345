{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe connecting Offshore Pump and Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.5)\n- Pipe connecting Boiler and Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -116.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (-39.5, -116.5), (-38.5, -113.5), and (-38.5, -112.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Small Electric Pole at Position (5.5, -60.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (7.5, -60.5) and (5.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of Automation Science Pack at Position (not specified), currently not receiving power\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups with various fluid systems, primarily empty, located at different positions on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This will prevent placement errors due to existing objects obstructing the desired position.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel and Power\n- Regularly check fuel levels in entities such as boilers and mining drills to ensure they are operational.\n- Ensure that electric poles are properly connected to provide power to entities that require electricity, such as inserters and labs.\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Connections\n- Verify that fluid connections between entities are properly established to prevent warnings about missing input liquids or blocked outputs."}
