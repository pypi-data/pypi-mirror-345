{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe latest attempt to load stone into the new active furnace has yielded the following results:\n\n### New Active Furnace Status:\n- The active furnace now contains **1 piece of stone** in its inventory.\n- The furnace still shows a status of **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"**, indicating it is not processing any materials despite having coal and stone present.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the newly built one)\n  - 9 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **1 piece of stone** available (now loaded into the furnace).\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is still unable to process materials, even though it has both coal and stone.\n- The absence of any active smelting operation suggests that additional ingredients or configurations might be needed.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Copper Ore into the Furnace**: I will insert the **1 piece of Copper Ore** to see if this triggers the smelting process.\n2. **Check Furnace Activation**: After inserting the Copper Ore, I will monitor the furnace to confirm if it begins processing.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by inserting the Copper Ore into the newly built furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the Copper Ore into the new active furnace to test its processing capability\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, new_active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Insert the available piece of Copper Ore into the new furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading Copper Ore\nnew_active_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_copper_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting copper ore.\n\nprint(f\"New Active Furnace inventory status after loading Copper Ore: {new_active_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading copper ore.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading Copper Ore: {overall_inventory_after_copper_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-368]"}
