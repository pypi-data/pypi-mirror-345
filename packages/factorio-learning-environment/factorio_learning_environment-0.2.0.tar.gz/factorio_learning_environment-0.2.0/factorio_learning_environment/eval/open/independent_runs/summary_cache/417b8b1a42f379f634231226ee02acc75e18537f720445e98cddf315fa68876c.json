{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a transport belt system and a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Transport Belt system connecting the mining drill to the chest, with multiple belts at positions (x=-24.5, y=-69.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-66.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) feeding it iron ore from a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt system connecting the iron ore source to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring iron ore to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates, filled by a Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0) with no ingredients to smelt and full fuel source.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Furnaces with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials to process. Check the transport system and inserters feeding the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to source items and that the transport belts or chests supplying them are not empty.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity (e.g., chest or transport belt) to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Furnace Fuel Source Full\n- Regularly check and manage the fuel levels in furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
