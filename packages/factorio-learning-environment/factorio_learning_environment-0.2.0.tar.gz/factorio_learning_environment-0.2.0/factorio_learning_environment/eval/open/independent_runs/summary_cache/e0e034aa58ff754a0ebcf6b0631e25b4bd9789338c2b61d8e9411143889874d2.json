Verify the correct naming and initialization of storage variables.\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Verify that all variables, such as 'additional_coal_storage', are defined before use. Check for typos or incorrect variable names and ensure they are initialized properly.\n\n### Errors when clearing drop chests\n- Ensure that the chests are not full and have space for extraction. Check the chest status and clear them if necessary before attempting to extract items."}
