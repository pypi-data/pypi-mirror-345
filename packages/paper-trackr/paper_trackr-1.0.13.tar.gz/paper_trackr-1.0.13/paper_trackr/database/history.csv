However, the heterogeneity of GC and their molecular characteristics are still largely unexplored.We employed single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively map the intra-tumoural heterogeneity within GC. Additionally, in vitro experiments, clinical sample analyses, and patient-derived organoid models (PDOs) were conducted to validate the key interaction patterns between tumor cells and stromal cells.Seven robust meta-programs (MP1-MP7) in GC were defined with distinct biological significance and spatial distributions. MP3 and MP4 were intimately associated with distinct CD8 T cells skewed toward a cytotoxic or exhaustion state, while MP7, characterised by the highest degree of malignancy, harboured an immune lockdown microenvironment around it and spatially associated with myofibroblasts (myCAFs). Notably, we clarified the interplay between the MP7 and myCAFs, where MP7 induces the chemotactic migration of fibroblasts and promoting their transformation into myCAFs via GDF15/TGFBR2, and in turn, myCAFs-derived RSPO3 up-regulates EGR1 to promote the transformation to MP7 in GC cells and human PDOs. Ultimately, the accumulation of myCAFs around MP7 led to fewer infiltration of CD8 T cells, resulting an immune-deprived microenvironment and the diminished efficacy of immunotherapy. Additionally, based on the gene expression signatures of MP7 GC cells, we predicted specific drugs and verified more potent inhibitory effects of Taselisib and Lapatinib for MP7 GC cells than conventional drugs at the same concentration.Taken together, these results deepened the understanding of GC heterogeneity and paved the way for novel therapeutic strategies by targeting MP7 GC cells and their interaction loop with myCAFs in GC treatment.Seven robust meta-programs (MP1-MP7) were identified in gastric cancer. MP7 was strongly correlated with cancer metastasis and poor survival of gastric cancer patients. MP7 promoted fibroblast transformation into myCAFs via GDF15/TGFBR2, creating an immune lockdown microenvironment. MyCAFs induced MP7 transformation via the RSPO3/EGR1 pathway, promoting gastric cancer cell migration.

Several studies have indicated that pyroptosis is one of the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AR. However, no research has investigated the molecular targets of pyroptosis in the context of AR. Our study endeavored to identify common biomarkers and mechanisms that could offer insights into the prevention of AR progression and novel therapeutic targets. Data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including GSE51392, GSE43523, and GSE44037, were downloaded and analyzed through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and random forest (RF) analysis to identify key intersecting genes associated with both AR and pyroptosis. The gene GZMA was identified as a significant candidate and was validated in another sample dataset (GSE101720). Western blot (WB) analysis confirmed the expression of GZMA in an AR mouse model. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were conducted to explore the functional roles of the shared genes. An immune infiltration matrix was established using CIBERSORT analysis to estimate the degree of immune cell infiltration in AR. Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) was performed to analyze the biological functions of hub genes. In the immune infiltration matrix of AR, a reduced expression of Tregs was observed in the AR group. WB analysis further indicated elevated expression of GZMA in the AR group. As a gene related to both AR and pyroptosis, GZMA expression was positively correlated with the gene expression levels of CD8 + T cells. The reduction in Tregs and the increase in CD8 + T cells in AR, along with enhanced pyroptosis, contribute to the development of allergic inflammation. Therefore, it was hypothesized that GZMA could serve as a novel target for the prevention and treatment of AR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40307356/,"machine learning, bioinformatics, genomics"

The ability to diagnose MMD early and develop personalized treatment plans can significantly improve the prognosis of patients. Here, we have introduced the research on MMD biomarkers. By integrating proteomics and metabolomics data, we have successfully identified over 1700 features from more than 60 serum samples collected at the onset of symptoms in MMD patients. We use multiple computational strategies to interpret complex information in serum, providing a comprehensive perspective for early diagnosis of MMD. Diagnostic ability of our biomarker is significantly better than previous studies, especially when used in combination. In the study of molecular mechanisms, we found that the ferroptosis pathway was significant disruption in MMD patients, which was also confirmed by transcriptomics data. Finally, we validated the metabolites and proteins associated with ferroptosis pathways, as well as the biomarkers screened by machine learning, using another independent MMD cohort.

Phenotype-based methods commonly rely on comparing phenotypes observed in a patient with databases of genotype-to-phenotype associations using measures of semantic similarity. They are constrained by the quality and completeness of these resources as well as the quality and completeness of patient phenotype annotation. Genotype-to-phenotype associations used by these methods are largely derived from the literature and coded using phenotype ontologies. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been trained on large amounts of text and data and have shown their potential to answer complex questions across multiple domains. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in prioritizing disease-associated genes compared to existing bioinformatics methods. We show that LLMs can prioritize disease-associated genes as well, or better than, dedicated bioinformatics methods relying on pre-defined phenotype similarity, when gene sets range from 5 to 100 candidates. We apply our approach to a cohort of undiagnosed patients with rare diseases and show that LLMs can be used to provide diagnostic support that helps in identifying plausible candidate genes. Our results show that LLMs may offer an alternative to traditional bioinformatics methods to prioritize disease-associated genes based on disease phenotypes.

To minimize issues with sample heterogeneity and additional freeze-thaw cycles during sample splitting, multiple -omics datasets (e.g. metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics) should ideally be generated from the same set of samples. For sample extraction, commonly biphasic organic solvent systems are used that require extensive multi-step protocols. Individual studies have recently also started to investigate monophasic (all-in-one) extraction procedures. The aim of the current study was to develop and systematically compare ten different mono- and biphasic extraction solvent mixtures for their potential to aid in the most comprehensive metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics datasets. As the focus was on human postmortem tissue samples (muscle and liver tissue), four tissue homogenization parameters were also evaluated. Untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, lipidomic and proteomics methods were utilized along with 1D sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay results.

The supernatant of the homogenate was further extracted. Comprehensive ranking, taking nine different processing parameters into account, showed that the monophasic extraction solvents, overall, showed better scores compared to the biphasic solvent systems, despite their recommendation for one or all of the -omics extractions.

S. K., Rodriguez, A. L., Bosilevac, J. M., Eppinger, M.",bioRxiv,2025-05-01,,"Non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), particularly the O118 serogroup, are emerging pathogens linked to severe foodborne illnesses, including hemolytic uremic syndrome. The hallmark of STEC virulence is the production of a potent phage-borne cytotoxin, often accompanied by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). This study explores the genomic landscape, virulence factors, and resistance traits of O118 STEC. We analyzed 357 publicly available O118 genomes across ten H-antigens and included two clinically significant O118:H16 STEC strains sequenced to closure. Pangenome assessment and core genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on 4,160 shared genes revealed phylogenetic clustering by H-type and delineated distinct STEC-phylogroups, alongside relationships to non-STEC pathovars such as uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Identified STEC phylogroups encompassed H6, H12, H16, and H2 strains with diverse Shiga toxin (stx) profiles (stx1a, stx2a, stx2b, stx2c, stx2f). A subset of H2-STEC lacked stx, suggesting potential secondary phage loss. Most STEC groups harbored the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Further, a strong correlation was observed between H-antigens and eae subtypes, with specific pairings such as H6/eae-{iota}, H16/eae-{beta}, and H2/eae-{varepsilon}. Horizontally acquired pathogenicity islands-including O-island 122 in H16 strains and a novel pathogenicity-associated island carrying antibiotic resistance-along with other loci related to colonization and interbacterial competition, further enhance these strains' virulence potential. Our findings underscore the genetic diversity and virulence potential of O118 STEC. Understanding phylogroup-specific traits and resistance markers is crucial for effective surveillance and public health interventions.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.29.651274v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics"
2025-05-01 16:20,Small pangenome of Candida parapsilosis reflects overall low intraspecific diversity,"Ryan, A., Bergin, S. A., Scully, J., Zuniga-Soto, E., Hession, C., Barber, A. E., Gomez-Molero, E., Bader, O., Morio, F., Zhai, B., Wolfe, K. H., Butler, G.",bioRxiv,2025-05-01,,"Candida parapsilosis is an opportunistic yeast pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised humans. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies of the species have demonstrated remarkably low diversity, with strains typically differing by about 1.5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per 10 kb. However, SNP calling alone does not capture the full extent of genetic variation. Here, we define the pangenome of 372 C. parapsilosis isolates to determine variation in gene content. The pangenome consists of 5,859 genes, of which 48 are not found in the genome of the reference strain. This includes 5,791 core genes (present in [≥] 99.5% of isolates). Four genes, including the allantoin permease gene DAL4, were present in all isolates but were truncated in some strains. The truncated DAL4 was classified as a pseudogene in the reference strain CDC317. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing showed that removing the early stop codon (producing the full-length Dal4 protein) is associated with improved use of allantoin as a sole nitrogen source. We find that the accessory genome of C. parapsilosis consists of 68 homologous clusters. This includes 38 previously annotated genes, 27 novel paralogs of previously annotated genes and 3 uncharacterised ORFs. Approximately one-third of the accessory genome (24/68 genes) is associated with gene fusions between tandem genes in the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Additionally, we identified two highly divergent C. parapsilosis strains and find that, despite their increased phylogenetic distance (~30 SNPs per 10 kb), both strains have similar gene content to the other 372.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651475v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics"
2025-05-01 16:20,The structure of phycobilisome with a bicylindrical core from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942,"Zhao, J., Gao, N., Zheng, Z.",bioRxiv,2025-05-01,,"Phycobilisomes (PBSs) are the major light-harvesting complexes in the cyanobacteria and red algae and they consist of a central core and peripheral rods that are attached to the core. The PBS cores contain 2-5 allophycocyanin cylinders that are organized by ApcE. At the present, structures of PBS with tricylindrical and pentacylindrical cores have been determined while the structure of the PBS with a bicylindrical core is yet to be revealed. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of PBS with bicylindrical core from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (Synechococcus 7942) at 2.98 [A] resolution. Similar to the PBS with a tricylindrical core, six peripheral rods are attached to the core by the rod-core linker protein CpcG in the PBS of Synechococcus 7942 even though the core lacks the top AP cylinder, which is important for the attachment of peripheral rods to the tricylindrical cores. We found that the C-terminus of ApcE in the Synechococcus 7942 was involved in interacting with both CpcG and CpcB of a top peripheral rod, compensating for the absence of the top AP cylinder of the core and maintaining PBS stability. Analysis of the bilin distribution reveals that distance of excitation energy transfer from top peripheral rods to the terminal emitters is approximately 15% shorter compared to the PBS with tricylindrical cores. Although there are 30% fewer bilin chromophores in the Synechococcus 7942 PBS core compared with the tricylindrical core, the aromatic residue ring in the Synechococcus 7942 PBS core is conserved, supporting the suggestion that these aromatic residues from AP and linker proteins are critical to the energy transfer of PBS.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.28.650843v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics, plant biology"

Through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and participatory observations with local communities, including a strong representation of women were applied. Thirty five spice species, primarily herbaceous, with Lamiaceae emerging as the most dominant family documents. The findings underscore the centrality of homegardens as reservoirs of agrobiodiversity and hubs of traditional knowledge transmission. Spices were found to serve diverse roles culinary, medicinal, and ritual positioning them as biocultural keystone species intricately linked to local health systems, cultural identity, and daily life. Community preference rankings and culinary preparation methods revealed nuanced valuations based not only on taste but also cultural symbolism and perceived health benefits. Moreover, the study highlights gendered and socioeconomic dimensions of spice use and management, revealing persistent inequalities in resource access, decision-making, and benefit-sharing, despite womens key roles in preserving and utilizing these resources. The research emphasizes the need for inclusive, gender-sensitive policies that recognize and protect indigenous ecological knowledge systems. It calls for participatory, community-led conservation strategies and further interdisciplinary studies on sustainable harvesting and the ecological dynamics of spice species across land-use systems. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge advocating for the integration of traditional knowledge into national biodiversity and food security agendas, highlighting the importance of empowering local communities, especially women, to ensure the resilience of cultural and biological heritage amid environmental and socioeconomic change.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.26.650802v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics, plant biology"
2025-05-01 16:20,An image analysis pipeline to quantify the spatial distribution of cell markers in stroma-rich tumors,"Ruzette, A. A., Kozlova, N., Cruz, K. A., Muranen, T., Norrelykke, S. F.",bioRxiv,2025-05-01,,"Aggressive cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), are often characterized by a complex and desmoplastic tumor microenvironment rich in stroma, a supportive connective tissue composed primarily of extracellular matrix (ECM) and non-cancerous cells. Desmoplasia, which is a dense deposition of stroma, is a major reason for therapy resistance, acting both as a physical barrier that interferes with drug penetration and as a supportive niche that protects cancer cells through diverse mechanisms. A precise understanding of spatial cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment in stroma-rich cancers is essential for optimizing therapeutic responses. It allows detailed mapping of stromal-tumor interfaces, comprehensive phenotyping of diverse cell types and their functional states, and insights into changes in cellular distribution and tissue architecture, thus leading to an improved assessment of drug responses. Recent advances in multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging have enabled the acquisition of large batches of whole-slide tumor images, but scalable and reproducible methods to analyze the spatial distribution of cell states relative to stromal regions remain limited. To address this gap, we developed an open-source computational pipeline that integrates QuPath (Bankhead et al. 2017), StarDist (Schmidt et al. 2018), and custom Python scripts to quantify biomarker expression at a single- and sub-cellular resolution across entire tumor sections. Our workflow includes: (i) automated nuclei segmentation using StarDist, (ii) machine learning-based cell classification using multiplexed marker expression, (iii) modeling of stromal regions based on fibronectin staining, (iv) sensitivity analyses on classification thresholds to ensure robustness across heterogeneous datasets, and (v) distance-based quantification of the proximity of each cell to the stromal border. To improve consistency across slides with variable staining intensities, we introduce a statistical strategy that translates classification thresholds by propagating a chosen reference percentile across the distribution of marker-related cell measurement in each image. We apply this approach to quantify spatial patterns of distribution of the phosphorylated form of the N-Myc downregulated gene 1 (NDRG1), a novel DNA repair protein that conveys signals from the ECM to the nucleus to maintain replication fork homeostasis, and a known cell proliferation marker Ki67 in fibronectin-defined stromal regions in PDAC xenografts.

2025-05-01 16:20,RECUR: Identifying recurrent amino acid substitutions from multiple sequence alignments,"Robbins, E. H., Liu, Y., Kelly, S.",bioRxiv,2025-04-30,,"Identifying recurrent changes in biological sequences is important to multiple aspects of biological research - from understanding the molecular basis of convergent phenotypes, to pinpointing the causative sequence changes that give rise to antibiotic resistance and disease. Here, we present RECUR, a method for identifying recurrent amino acid substitutions from multiple sequence alignments that is fast, easy to use, and scalable to thousands of sequences. We demonstrate the utility and performance characteristics of RECUR on a data set of surface glycoprotein (S) protein sequences from SARS-CoV-2 - identifying widespread recurrent evolution throughout the protein. Structural analysis of the recurrently evolving sites revealed significant enrichment in the exposed receptor-binding S1 subunit and at the interface with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), whereas recurrent substitutions were depleted at the trimeric interface of the S protein. Finally, in silico modelling showed that recurrent substitutions have primarily acted to stabilise the trimeric interface, but had no consistent effect at the hACE2 interface, suggesting that evolution at these sites has been shaped by opposing selection pressures - balancing the need to maintain or enhance hACE2 binding with pressures to diversify and evade host immune responses.
