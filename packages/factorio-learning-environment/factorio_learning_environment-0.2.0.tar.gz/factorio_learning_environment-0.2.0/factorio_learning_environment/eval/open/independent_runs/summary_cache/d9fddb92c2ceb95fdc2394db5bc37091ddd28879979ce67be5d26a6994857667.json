{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump and steam engine, with various positions including (-40.5, -116.5), (-42.5, -111.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no fuel\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0), both with coal but lacking ingredients\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5), not receiving electricity, connected to a small electric pole at Position (5.5, -60.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups in various positions, such as (-43.5, -120.5), (-1.5, 11.5), (-0.5, 17.5), (-12.5, 23.5), (-4.5, 24.5), (1.5, 24.5), and (2.5, 25.5), all currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles distributed across various positions, such as (-9.5, -76.5), (-7.5, -81.5), (-3.5, -80.5), and others, with no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Argument Types\n- Ensure that when using functions like `pickup_entity`, the arguments are of the correct type. For example, the second argument must be a Position object.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Before crafting items, verify that all necessary raw materials are available. For instance, small electric poles require wood, which must be gathered as it cannot be crafted.\n\n### Errors with Fuel and Power\n- Regularly check that all entities requiring fuel, such as burner mining drills and furnaces, are adequately supplied to ensure continuous operation.\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, like inserters, are connected to a power source to avoid operational interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Inventory and Storage\n- Monitor storage capacities to prevent mining drills from halting due to full chests. Regularly empty chests to maintain production flow."}
