Clear the area if necessary.\n- Verify that you have the required pipes in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n- Check that the positions for connecting underground pipes are correct and within allowable distance for connection.\n\n### Errors with Entity Connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine and boiler are properly connected to the offshore pump and each other to complete the electricity generation setup.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for construction and connection tasks to avoid placement failures due to lack of items.\n\n### API Usage\n- Avoid attempting to call non-callable objects, such as 'Position', as this leads to errors. Ensure correct usage of API functions and objects."}
