{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining structure at position(x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of a burner-mining-drill at position (x=41, y=-82) and two chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal transportation structure at position(x=39.5, y=-81.5)\nConsists of a burner-inserter at position (x=39.5, y=-81.5) that picks up coal from the mining structure and drops it at position (x=39.5, y=-80.5).\n\n### Furnace structure at position(x=0, y=0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (x=0, y=0) with a fuel source of coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when inserting coal into a full inventory\n- Ensure the inventory of the burner-mining-drill is not full before attempting to insert coal.\n- Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining.\n\n### Errors when extracting coal from a chest\n- Ensure the chest is not empty before attempting to extract coal.\n\n### Errors when using a burner-inserter\n- Ensure the inserter has a source of items to pick up before attempting to use it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* `insert_item`: a function that inserts an item into an entity's inventory. \n  - Failure mode: attempting to insert an item into a full inventory.\n  - Success mode: successfully inserting an item into an entity's inventory.\n* `extract_item`: a function that extracts an item from an entity's inventory. \n  - Failure mode: attempting to extract an item from an empty inventory.\n  - Success mode: successfully extracting an item from an entity's inventory.\n* Important variables:\n  - `coal_chest`: a chest entity that stores coal.\n  - `drill`: a burner-mining-drill entity that mines coal.\n  - `inserter`: a burner-inserter entity that picks up and drops coal.\n  - `furnace`: a stone furnace entity that smelts coal."}
