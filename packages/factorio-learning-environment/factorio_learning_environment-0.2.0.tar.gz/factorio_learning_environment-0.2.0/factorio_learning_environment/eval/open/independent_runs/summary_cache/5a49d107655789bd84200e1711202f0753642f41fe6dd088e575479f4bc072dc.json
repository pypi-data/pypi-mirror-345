{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Stone furnace (position: (-13.0, -50.0))\n- **Use-case:** Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n#### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Burner mining drill (position: (41.0, -82.0))\n- **Use-case:** Used for mining coal from the nearby coal patch.\n\n#### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Wooden chest (position: (41.5, -79.5))\n- **Use-case:** Intended to store coal mined by the burner mining drill.\n\n#### Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Burner inserter (position: (41.5, -80.5))\n- **Use-case:** Transfers coal from the burner mining drill to the wooden chest.\n\n#### Burner Mining Drill at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Burner mining drill (position: (43.0, -82.0))\n- **Use-case:** Used for mining coal from the nearby coal patch.\n\n#### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -79.5)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Burner inserter (position: (43.5, -79.5))\n- **Use-case:** Transfers coal from the burner mining drill to the wooden chest.\n\n#### Belt Group connecting Burner Mining Drill at (43.0, -82.0) to Burner Inserter at (43.5, -79.5)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Transport belts (13 belts connecting the drill to the inserter)\n- **Use-case:** Transports coal from the burner mining drill to the burner inserter.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without having the required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like stone furnaces, burner mining drills, or wooden chests.\n- Example: Attempting to place a stone furnace without having stone in inventory.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without having the required sub-ingredients\n- Always check if you have the necessary sub-ingredients before attempting to craft items.\n- Example: Attempting to craft transport belts without having iron plates, which require smelting in a furnace.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities without having the items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces or mining drills.\n- Example: Attempting to insert coal into a burner mining drill without having coal in inventory.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use inserters to transfer items from belts to chests instead of trying to connect belts directly.\n- Example: Attempting to connect transport belts directly to a wooden chest.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without crafting them first\n- Ensure you craft the required entities (e.g., burner inserters) before attempting to place them.\n- Example: Attempting to place a burner inserter without crafting it first.\n\n#### Errors when referencing undefined variables\n- Always define variables before referencing them in your code.\n- Example: Referencing a variable `chest` that was not defined.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills have blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a valid destination (e.g., a chest with an inserter) for the output of mining drills to avoid blocked outputs.\n- Example: Burner mining drill output blocked due to no valid destination.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ingredients to smelt before expecting them to produce items.\n- Example: Stone furnace has no ingredients to smelt despite having fuel.\n\n#### Errors when transport belts are not properly connected\n- Ensure transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to avoid blockages or invalid paths.\n- Example: Failed to connect transport belts due to an invalid path.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to craft items without the necessary crafting machine\n- Ensure you have the required crafting machine (e.g., furnace or assembling machine) to craft certain items.\n- Example: Attempting to craft iron plates without a furnace.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to place entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity.\n- Example: Attempting to place a burner inserter in a tile already occupied by another entity.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert items into entities without fuel\n- Ensure entities like inserters and mining drills have fuel before attempting to insert items.\n- Example: Attempting to insert coal into a burner inserter without having coal in inventory.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to rotate inserters without proper alignment\n- Ensure inserters are correctly aligned to pick up and drop"}
