{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Plant at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-6.5, 0.0) connected to offshore pump via pipes\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 0.5) connected to boiler via pipes\n- Power network (id=818) connecting to all mining drills\n\n### Secondary Power Plant at position (-15.5, -3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-15.5, -3.5)\n- Boiler at (-12.0, -4.5) connected to offshore pump via pipes (currently fueled with coal)\n- Steam engine at (-8.5, -4.5) connected to boiler via pipes\n- Power network (id=5262) connecting to mining drills\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- 5 Electric mining drills at:\n  - (15.5, 70.5) with output blocked warning\n  - (18.5, 70.5) with output blocked warning\n  - (21.5, 70.5) with output blocked warning\n  - (24.5, 70.5) with output blocked warning\n  - (27.5, 70.5) with output blocked warning\n- 5 Iron smelting furnaces at:\n  - (16.0, 68.0) - no ingredients, fuel full\n  - (19.0, 68.0) - no ingredients, fuel full\n  - (22.0, 68.0) - no fuel\n  - (25.0, 68.0) - no fuel\n  - (28.0, 68.0) - no fuel\n- 5 Steel smelting furnaces at:\n  - (16.0, 65.0) - no ingredients, fuel full\n  - (19.0, 65.0) - no ingredients, fuel full\n  - (22.0, 65.0) - no fuel\n  - (25.0, 65.0) - no fuel\n  - (28.0, 65.0) - no fuel\n- 5 Burner inserters between iron and steel furnaces at:\n  - (16.5, 66.5) - waiting for source items\n  - (19.5, 66.5) - waiting for source items\n  - (22.5, 66.5) - waiting for source items\n  - (25.5, 66.5) - waiting for source items\n  - (28.5, 66.5) - waiting for source items\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 73.5)\n- Burner inserter at (16.5, 72.5) - waiting for source items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt connection errors (repeated 6 times)\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from chests - always use inserters as intermediaries\n- When connecting belts between entities, verify the target entity can accept direct belt input\n- Ensure valid path exists between source and destination before attempting belt connections\n\n### Placement errors (repeated 4 times)\n- Verify position is empty before placing new entities (wooden chest at (15.5, 73.5) already exists)\n- When using place_entity_next_to(), adjust spacing or direction if placement fails due to existing objects\n\n### Furnace operation issues\n- 3 furnaces are out of fuel at positions (22.0, 65.0), (25.0, 65.0), (28.0, 65.0)\n- All furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - need to connect mining output to furnaces\n- Don't overfill furnace fuel slots (50 coal is maximum capacity)\n\n### Mining drill output issues\n- All 5 mining drills show \"output blocked\" warnings - need to:\n  - Connect output to furnaces via belts/inserters\n  - Or provide chests with working inserters to collect output\n- Current inserter at (16.5, 72.5) is waiting for source items - verify connection to mining drill\n\n### Inserter operation problems\n- All burner inserters between furnaces are waiting for source items\n- Verify inserter pickup/drop positions are correctly aligned with furnace input/output slots\n- Ensure inserters have sufficient fuel (coal) to operate\n\n### Power distribution\n- Verify all mining drills are properly connected to power network\n- Check power production meets demand (current throughput shows no production)"}
