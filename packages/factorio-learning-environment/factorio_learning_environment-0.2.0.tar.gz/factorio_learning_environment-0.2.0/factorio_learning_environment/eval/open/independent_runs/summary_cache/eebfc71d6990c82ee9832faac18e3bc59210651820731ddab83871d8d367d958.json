{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-8.0, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler (position x=-8.0, y=0.5)\n- Steam Engine (position x=3.5, y=0.5)\n- Offshore Pump (position x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with a burner inserter (position x=-13.5, y=-47.5)\n- Stone Furnace (position x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with a burner inserter (position x=-13.5, y=-47.5)\n- Transport Belts and Inserters connecting furnaces to chests and other entities\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests and Iron Chests for storage\n- Transport Belts and Burner Inserters for moving items between entities\n\n### Pipe and Fluid System\nConsists of:\n- Pipe Groups for transporting water from the offshore pump to the boiler\n- Pipe Group (fluid system=7444) carrying water from offshore pump\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or connect entities. For example, attempting to place a boiler or steam engine without having them in inventory results in errors.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- When connecting entities, ensure that the correct attributes and methods are used. For example, using 'Position' object incorrectly can lead to connection errors.\n\n### Inserter and Belt Management\n- Ensure inserters have access to source items and space in their destination to avoid waiting states. Adjust the layout or supply of items to resolve these issues.\n\n### Fluid and Power Connection Issues\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established and that power connections are complete to ensure the steam engine generates power. Check for any missing pipes or incorrect connections.\n\n### Attribute and Method Usage\n- Use correct attributes and methods for entity status checks. Incorrect attribute usage, such as 'CONNECTED', can lead to attribute errors.\n\n### Inventory Full Errors\n- Manage inventory levels to prevent errors when inserting items into entities that are already full. Adjust inventory management to accommodate item flow."}
