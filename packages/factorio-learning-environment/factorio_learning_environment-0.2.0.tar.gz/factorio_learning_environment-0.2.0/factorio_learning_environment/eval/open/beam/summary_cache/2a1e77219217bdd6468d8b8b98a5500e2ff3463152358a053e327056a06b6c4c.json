{"content": "The errors and messages indicate that the necessary materials to craft a Stone Furnace and a Boiler are not available in the inventory. Here's a step-by-step guide to address this issue:\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Gather Required Materials**:\n   - **Stone Furnace**: Requires 5 stones.\n   - **Boiler**: Requires 5 iron plates and 1 stone furnace.\n\n2. **Check Inventory**:\n   - Use `inspect_inventory()` to check the current inventory for stone and iron plates.\n   - If you have iron ore or copper ore, consider smelting them into plates using a furnace.\n\n3. **Mine Resources**:\n   - If stones or iron plates are missing, you need to mine these resources.\n   - Use `mine_resource(Prototype.Stone)` or `mine_resource(Prototype.IronOre)` to gather the necessary materials.\n\n4. **Smelt Iron Ore**:\n   - If you have iron ore, use a furnace to smelt it into iron plates.\n   - Ensure the furnace has fuel (e.g., coal) to operate.\n\n5. **Craft Items**:\n   - Once you have enough materials, craft the Stone Furnace and then the Boiler.\n   - Use `craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)` and `craft_item(Prototype.Boiler)`.\n\n### Example Code:\n\n```python\n# Check current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Current Inventory:\", inventory)\n\n# Mine resources if needed\nif inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0) < 5:\n    print(\"Mining stone...\")\n    mine_resource(Prototype.Stone, 5 - inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0))\n\nif inventory.get(Prototype.IronOre, 0) > 0:\n    # Smelt iron ore into iron plates\n    print(\"Smelting iron ore...\")\n    # Ensure you have a furnace and fuel\n    # Example: insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, 10) and smelt iron ore\n\n# Recheck inventory after mining/smelting\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Updated Inventory:\", inventory)\n\n# Craft Stone Furnace if needed\nif inventory.get(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 0) < 1 and inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0) >= 5:\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\n    print(\"Crafted Stone Furnace.\")\n\n# Craft Boiler if possible\nif inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 5 and inventory.get(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 0) >= 1:\n    craft_item(Prototype.Boiler)\n    print(\"Crafted Boiler.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Still missing materials to craft Boiler.\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- Always ensure you have enough fuel for smelting processes.\n- Keep track of your inventory and resources to avoid running out of essential materials.\n- Automate resource gathering and processing if possible to streamline the crafting process.", "summary_range": "[1-268]"}
