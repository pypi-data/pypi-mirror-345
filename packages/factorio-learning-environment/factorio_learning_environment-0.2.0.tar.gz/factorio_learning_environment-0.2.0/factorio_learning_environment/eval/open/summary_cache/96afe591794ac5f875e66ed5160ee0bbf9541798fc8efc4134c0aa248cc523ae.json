{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, currently out of fuel and without iron ore in inventory.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) facing up, currently out of fuel and without ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) intended to move iron plates from furnace to chest, currently fueled but waiting for source items.\n\nThis structure is designed to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and store the plates in the chest. The inserter is meant to transfer plates from the furnace to the chest but is currently unable to operate due to lack of input items.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing burner inserter next to furnace due to occupied tile\n- The burner inserter placement attempts at position (17.5, 73.5) failed because a wooden chest already occupies that tile.\n- To fix this, increase the spacing when placing the inserter, change the placement direction, or choose a different reference position to avoid overlapping entities.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items and drill output blocked\n- Inserter at (18.5, 73.5) is waiting for source items because the burner mining drill at (16.0, 71.0) has no iron ore in its inventory.\n- The drill reports output blocked warnings due to no sink entity to accept mined ore.\n- Ensure the drill is fueled and able to output mined ore to the furnace or a belt to avoid blocking.\n- Confirm that inserters are correctly positioned to transfer ore from drill to furnace.\n\n### Fuel management issues causing entity stoppage\n- Burner mining drill and furnace are frequently out of fuel, causing them to stop working.\n- Maintain a steady supply of coal to these entities to keep them operational.\n- Automate coal insertion or monitor fuel levels to prevent downtime.\n\n### Inventory insertion failure due to empty inventory\n- Attempt to insert coal into an inserter failed because no coal was available in inventory.\n- Ensure sufficient fuel resources are harvested or stocked before attempting insertion.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent so far."}
