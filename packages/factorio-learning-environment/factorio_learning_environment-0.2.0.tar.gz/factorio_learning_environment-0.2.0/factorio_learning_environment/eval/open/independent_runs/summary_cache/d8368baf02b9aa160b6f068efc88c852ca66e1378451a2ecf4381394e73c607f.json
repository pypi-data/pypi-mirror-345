Ensure sufficient resources are available before attempting to craft or place items. For example, the agent repeatedly attempts to craft items when it does not have enough iron ore or wooden chests.\n\n### Inserter blocked by transport belt\n- The inserter is blocked by a transport belt. Ensure that inserters are not blocked by other entities, such as transport belts, when placing them.\n\n### Inserter already has fuel\n- The agent attempts to insert fuel into an inserter that already has fuel. Check the inserter's inventory before inserting fuel.\n\n### Inserter blocked by transport belt, but transport belt no longer exists\n- The agent reports that an inserter is blocked by a transport belt, but then reports that the transport belt is no longer there. This suggests the agent is not correctly tracking the state of the world. Ensure the agent's world model is up-to-date before making decisions.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n### Variables:\n- inventory: Dict[str, int] = {'transport-belt': 13, 'burner-inserter': 2, 'wood': 100, 'coal': 3600, 'iron-plate': 401}\n```"}
