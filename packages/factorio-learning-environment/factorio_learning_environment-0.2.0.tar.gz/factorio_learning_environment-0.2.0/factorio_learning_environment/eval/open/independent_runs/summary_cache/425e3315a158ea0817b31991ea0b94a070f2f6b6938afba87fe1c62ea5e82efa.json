{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Incomplete Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple Pipe Groups connecting these entities, but with failed connections and blockages.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving power.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5) for storage.\n\n### Lab Facility\n- Lab with input of automation science packs but not receiving power.\n\n### Power Network\n- Power Pole at Position (5.6, -61.2) connected to the network.\n- Power Pole at Position (11.246478873239436, -14.950704225352112) not connected due to missing items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are placed correctly without any blockages. Check if the path is clear and all necessary connections are made between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Power Network Connection Issues\n- Verify that all power poles are within range of each other and connected properly. Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to complete connections.\n\n### Insufficient Power Supply\n- Make sure the steam engine is generating power by ensuring all connections are correct and there is a sufficient supply of water and fuel.\n\n### Inserter and Lab Not Receiving Power\n- Check the power network to ensure that all connected devices are receiving electricity. Verify connections from power poles to the inserter and lab.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items for construction and connection tasks."}
