Verify the placement area is clear before connecting.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Always check your inventory for required items before attempting to insert them into machines or entities. Maintain a sufficient stock of essential resources like coal.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure all electrical entities are connected to a power source. Check the connections and ensure that the power network is complete and functional.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available for production processes in assembling machines and furnaces. Ensure that supply lines are adequately stocked.\n\n### Errors Due to Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel entities like boilers and burner mining drills to prevent interruptions in production. Keep track of fuel levels and replenish them as needed."}
