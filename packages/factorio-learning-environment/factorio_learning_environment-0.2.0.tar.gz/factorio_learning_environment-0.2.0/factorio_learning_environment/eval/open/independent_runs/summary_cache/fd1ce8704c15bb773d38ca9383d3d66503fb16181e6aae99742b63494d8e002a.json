{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, y=-60.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (9.5, -60.5) for additional storage.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Iron chests at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) for additional storage of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a non-existent entity\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from exists and contains the required items before attempting extraction. For example, the error at position (4.5, -58.5) occurred because there was no valid entity containing iron ore.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal and iron ore in your inventory to keep the furnaces and mining drills operational. The errors at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) were due to a lack of iron ore.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in production. The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) issued a warning because the chest at the drop position (4.5, -58.5) was full.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of a resource from a given position. Failure occurs if the entity does not exist or lacks the resource.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_iron_ore`: Represents the quantity of iron ore extracted from a chest.\n- `iron_ore_inventory`: Tracks the amount of iron ore available for processing.\n- `coal_inventory`: Tracks the amount of coal available for fueling furnaces and mining drills."}
