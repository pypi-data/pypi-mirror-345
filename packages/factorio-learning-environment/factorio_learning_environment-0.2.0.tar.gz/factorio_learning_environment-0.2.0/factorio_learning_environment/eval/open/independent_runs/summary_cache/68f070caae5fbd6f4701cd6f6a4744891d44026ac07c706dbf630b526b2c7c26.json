{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore. It is fueled with coal and currently working.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storage of extracted materials. The chest at (-14.5, -48.5) contains iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) which transfers items between chests. It is fueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal and currently working.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a non-existent entity\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract items from exists and contains the required items. Verify the entity's position and inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Before placing an entity, check the target position to ensure it is not already occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing or changing the direction to avoid collisions with existing structures.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check the storage capacity of chests and other storage entities. Ensure they have enough space to accommodate additional items to prevent interruptions in the production process.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure that entities requiring fuel, such as burner inserters and furnaces, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly monitor fuel levels and replenish as needed."}
