Consider increasing spacing, changing the direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Verify the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring items from the source to the destination. Double-check the pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to function. Check the inserter setup and item flow to the furnace to resolve any input issues."}
