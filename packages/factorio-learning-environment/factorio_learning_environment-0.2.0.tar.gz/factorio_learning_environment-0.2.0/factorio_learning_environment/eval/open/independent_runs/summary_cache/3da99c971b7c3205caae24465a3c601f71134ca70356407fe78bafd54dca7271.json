{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Repeated checks and repositioning of the inserter at (-13.5, -48.5) indicate alignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Monitor and maintain adequate coal supplies for refueling entities like the mining drill and inserters. Instances of insufficient coal have been noted, affecting operations.\n\n### Errors with Inventory and Storage Management\n- Regularly check and manage chest inventories to prevent overflow and ensure continuous mining operations. The chest at (-14.5, -48.5) was reported full, halting mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting. The furnace at (-12.0, -48.0) is not receiving iron ore, possibly due to inserter misalignment or blockage."}
