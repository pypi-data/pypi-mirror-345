{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-10.0, 0.0)\nConsists of steam engine (position -10.0, 0.0), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position not specified).\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of lab (position -17.5, 23.5) connected to steam engine at (-10.0, 0.0).\n\n### Assembling machine factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) connected to steam engine at (-10.0, 0.0).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Pipe network at position(-4.5, 21.5)\nConsists of pipe group (fluid system 50095) at position (-4.5, 21.5) and pipe group (fluid system 50096) at position (-4.5, 23.5).\n\n### Electric power network\nConsists of electricity group (id 221672) with poles at positions:\n- (-15.5, 24.5)\n- (-23.5, 26.5)\n- (-21.5, 27.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to obstructions\n- Ensure there are no obstructions at the target location before attempting to place entities. This includes checking for other entities or structures that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when using attributes incorrectly\n- Avoid using attributes that do not exist for certain object types, such as trying to access 'position' on a list. Always verify the type of object before accessing its attributes.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that all entities are properly powered and connected before attempting to use them. For example, the assembling machine is not receiving electricity, which may prevent it from functioning.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This includes checking for existing entities in the target location.\n\n### Errors when removing entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to remove exists and is not protected or locked by the game mechanics."}
