{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around y=-80)\nConsists of:\n- 2 stone furnaces at positions (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\n- 4 burner inserters at:\n  - (45.5, -81.5) and (47.5, -81.5) for output handling\n  - (45.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5) for input handling\n- Storage chests:\n  - Output chests at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) containing iron plates\n  - Input chests at (45.5, -77.5) and (47.5, -77.5)\n  - Additional storage at (49.5, -79.5) containing mixed resources\n  - Coal storage at (49.5, -80.5)\n\n### Coal Mining System (around y=-85)\nConsists of:\n- 2 burner inserters at:\n  - (38.5, -84.5) for fuel handling\n  - (38.5, -86.5) for output handling\n- Storage chest at (39.5, -87.5)\n- Transport belt system:\n  - Main belt group from y=-86.5 to y=-83.5\n  - Secondary belt group from x=52.5 to x=56.5 at y=-81.5\n  - Additional belt at (44.5, -81.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Inventory Management Issues\n- Ensure sufficient inventory slots are available before crafting (multiple failures to craft iron-gear-wheel due to full inventory)\n- Consider storing excess materials in chests when inventory space is needed\n\n2. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones (transport-belt placement failures at (44.0, -82.0) and (56.0, -82.0))\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing larger entities like burner-mining-drill\n\n3. Resource Requirements\n- Gather raw resources (like stone) before attempting to craft items that require them\n- Plan resource gathering before starting crafting chains that require raw materials\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  Success: When target location is clear\n  Failure: When location is occupied or invalid\n\nVariables:\n- transport-belt: int (quantity in inventory)\n- burner-inserter: int (quantity in inventory)\n- coal: int (quantity in inventory)\n- iron-ore: int (quantity in inventory)\n- iron-plate: int (quantity in inventory)\n- stone: int (quantity in inventory)\n- wood: int (quantity in inventory)"}
