{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled with coal\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace, fueled with coal\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine, fueled with coal\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine, fueled with coal\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels (currently full)\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, currently not powered and missing iron plates as input\n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) providing electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters; however, assembler remains unpowered despite connections\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. The burner mining drill, furnace, and inserters are fueled with coal. The assembling machine is not receiving power and is blocked due to missing input resources and full output chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power despite electric pole connections\n- Ensure that electric poles are properly connected in the power network and have sufficient power supply.\n- Verify that the assembling machine\u2019s power connection points are correctly linked to poles.\n- Check that poles are not placed too far or isolated from the assembler.\n- Confirm that the power network has active energy sources supplying electricity.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into inserters and other burner entities when inventory is empty\n- Before attempting to insert coal into burner inserters or drills, verify that the inventory contains sufficient coal.\n- Implement inventory checks to avoid exceptions caused by trying to insert coal when none is available.\n- When coal runs out, prioritize harvesting or acquiring coal before refueling burner entities.\n\n### Errors caused by full output chests blocking inserters\n- When output chests (e.g., wooden chest at (18.5, 73.5)) are full, inserters feeding into them will wait and block production flow.\n- Regularly monitor chest inventories and clear or expand storage capacity to prevent blocking.\n- Consider adding logistic solutions or additional chests to handle overflow.\n\n### Errors attempting to connect transport belts directly from furnaces or redundant belt connections\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from furnaces; always use inserters to transfer items.\n- Avoid redundant transport belt connections if the connection is already established or unnecessary.\n\n### General tips to mitigate placement, power, and fuel errors\n- Always confirm the target tile is free and not occupied before placing entities.\n- Confirm inventory contains the required entity type or fuel before placement or insertion attempts.\n- Follow correct entity connection hierarchy (inserter between furnace and belt).\n- Regularly verify power network connectivity and energy levels of electric entities.\n- Implement inventory and resource checks before refueling burner entities to avoid exceptions.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
