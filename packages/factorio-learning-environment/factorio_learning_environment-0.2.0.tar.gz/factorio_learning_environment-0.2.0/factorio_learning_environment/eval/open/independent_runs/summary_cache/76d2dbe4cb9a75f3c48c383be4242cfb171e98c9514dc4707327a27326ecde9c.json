For example, do not compare a 'Chest' instance with an integer. Check the type of the variable before performing comparisons.\n\n- **Errors when using undefined names**\n  - Make sure to define or import all necessary classes and variables before using them. For instance, 'Chest' and 'Inventory' must be defined or imported to avoid NameError.\n\n- **Errors when extracting from an inventory that is full**\n  - Check the status of the inventory before attempting to extract items. If the chest is full, you may need to empty it before further extraction.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. If the tile is occupied, you will need to clear it first.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Defined Functions:**\n  - None reported in the current steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inserted_ore`: Type unknown, but used in comparisons.\n  - `inventory`: Type `Inventory`, used for managing items.\n  - `wooden_chest`: Type `Chest`, used for storing items.\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Type `BurnerMiningDrill`, used for mining resources.\n  - `furnace`: Type `Furnace`, used for smelting resources."}
