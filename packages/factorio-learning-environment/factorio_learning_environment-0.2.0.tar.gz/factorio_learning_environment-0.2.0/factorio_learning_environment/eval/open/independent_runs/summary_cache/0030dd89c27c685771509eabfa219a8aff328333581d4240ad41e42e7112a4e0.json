{"content": "Based on the provided logs, here is the updated report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining System (around -15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -51.5) for fuel loading\n- Wooden chest at (-13.5, -50.5) for temporary storage\n- Output inserter at (-12.5, -50.5) loading to belt system\n- Storage chest at (-6.5, -52.5) collecting iron ore\n- Collection inserter at (-6.5, -51.5) moving ore to storage\n- Belt system connecting components with 6 belts from (-11.5, -50.5) to (-6.5, -50.5)\n\n### Coal Mining System (around 38.0, -83.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Storage chest at (39.5, -83.5) containing 576 coal\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -86.5) handling coal movement\n- Additional storage chest at (41.5, -86.5) containing 773 iron ore\n\n### Smelting Area (around 46.0, -80.0)\n- Two stone furnaces at (46.0, -80.0) and (51.0, -80.0)\n- Multiple burner inserters for material handling:\n  - At (46.5, -81.5) and (47.5, -81.5) for first furnace\n  - At (51.5, -81.5) for second furnace\n- Storage chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Complex belt system connecting mining area to smelting area\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Ensure proper spacing when placing inserters near other entities\n- Check for existing objects before attempting to place new structures\n- When building storage solutions, leave adequate space for inserters\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Clear blocked belts to prevent backup in the production line\n- Monitor belt capacity to prevent overflow situations\n\n### Operational Issues\n- Keep mining drills and inserters properly fueled for continuous operation\n- Monitor storage chest capacity to prevent overflow\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- EntityStatus: Enum (WORKING, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, NO_INGREDIENTS, etc.)\n- Direction: Enum (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- Position: Class (x: float, y: float)\n- Inventory: Class (dict-like structure tracking item quantities)\n\n### Entity States\n- BurnerMiningDrill: Working state with fuel monitoring\n- BurnerInserter: Multiple states (WORKING, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION)\n- Furnace: NO_INGREDIENTS state when empty\n- BeltGroup: WORKING, FULL_OUTPUT states with inventory tracking"}
