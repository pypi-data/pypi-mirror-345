{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -86.0): Extracts coal from the resource patch.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (41.5, -84.5): Transports coal from the mining drill to the burner inserter.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5): Transfers coal from the transport belt to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -82.5): Stores the mined coal.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients for smelting.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill and burner inserter are refueled with coal before they run out of fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n#### Errors with idle furnaces\n- The stone furnace at (-13.0, -50.0) is idle due to lack of ingredients. Ensure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore or copper ore) and fuel to begin smelting.\n\n#### General tips for inventory management\n- Monitor the inventory of entities like the wooden chest to ensure they do not become full, which could halt production. Consider expanding storage or automating item transport to other locations."}
