{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal (fuel inventory 44) but output blocked due to no sink entity accepting output on ground  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal (fuel inventory 46), currently working with iron ore input and iron plate output  \n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from mining drill to furnace, currently out of fuel and waiting for source items  \n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from assembling machine, out of fuel and waiting for source items  \n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into assembling machine, out of fuel and waiting for space in destination  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, not receiving electricity and has zero energy  \n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide power connections but assembler remains unpowered  \n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, fuel shortages in inserters and power connectivity issues are causing blockages and halted production.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to assembler not receiving power  \n- The assembling machine 2 remains unpowered despite electric poles being placed and connected.  \n- Verify that electric poles are correctly positioned to cover the assembler and all inserters requiring power.  \n- Confirm the electric poles are connected to a power source and form a continuous power network.  \n- Check for any wiring or connection logic errors preventing power delivery to the assembler.  \n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters and mining drills due to empty inventory  \n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into burner inserters and mining drills fail because the inventory has no coal available at the time of insertion.  \n- Ensure sufficient coal is harvested and stocked in inventory before attempting to insert fuel into burner entities.  \n- Implement checks to confirm inventory coal quantity before fuel insertion calls to avoid exceptions.  \n- Consider harvesting coal proactively or maintaining a buffer stock to prevent fuel starvation.  \n\n### Errors related to burner inserters running out of fuel and waiting for source or destination space  \n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5) are out of fuel and unable to operate, causing production bottlenecks.  \n- Ensure timely insertion of coal fuel into burner inserters to keep them operational.  \n- Monitor fuel levels of burner inserters and automate refueling to prevent stoppages.  \n\n### Errors due to blocked output from burner mining drill and inserters  \n- The burner mining drill at (16.0, 71.0) reports output blocked by items on the ground due to no sink entity accepting output.  \n- Burner inserters feeding the assembling machine also report waiting for space in destination.  \n- Verify that all inserters and chests are correctly positioned and connected to accept outputs without blockage.  \n- Adjust inserter drop positions or add additional storage to prevent output congestion.  \n\n### General tips to mitigate placement, power, and fuel errors  \n- Before inserting fuel or items, check inventory availability to avoid insertion exceptions.  \n- Confirm power pole coverage and network connectivity before relying on electric machines.  \n- Maintain fuel supply chains to burner entities to avoid operational downtime.  \n- Monitor entity statuses regularly to detect and resolve blockages or shortages early.  \n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
