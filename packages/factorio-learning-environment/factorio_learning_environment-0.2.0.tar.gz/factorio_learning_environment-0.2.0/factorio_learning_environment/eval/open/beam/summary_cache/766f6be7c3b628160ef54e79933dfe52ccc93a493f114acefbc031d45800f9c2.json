{"content": "I see the pattern now - the error is consistently occurring when trying to place the inserter. The issue is that we're trying to place it too close to the stone furnace. Let's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n# Move to the drill position\nmove_to(Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0))\n\n# Place transport belt from drill's output\nbelt = place_entity(\n    Prototype.TransportBelt,\n    position=Position(x=-10.5, y=26.5),\n    direction=Direction.DOWN\n)\n\nif belt:\n    print(f\"Placed first belt at: {belt.position}\")\n    \n    # Place second belt\n    belt2 = place_entity(\n        Prototype.TransportBelt,\n        position=Position(x=-10.5, y=27.5),\n        direction=Direction.DOWN\n    )\n    \n    if belt2:\n        print(f\"Placed second belt at: {belt2.position}\")\n        \n        # Place inserter with offset to avoid collision with furnace\n        # Try placing it slightly to the side\n        inserter = place_entity(\n            Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n            position=Position(x=-11.5, y=28.5),  # Offset to the left\n            direction=Direction.RIGHT  # Face towards furnace\n        )\n        \n        if inserter:\n            # Add fuel to inserter\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n            print(f\"Placed and fueled inserter at: {inserter.position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entity status: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nKey changes made:\n1. Instead of using place_entity_next_to(), we're using explicit positioning\n2. Moved the inserter position to the side (-11.5 instead of -10.5)\n3. Changed inserter direction to face right towards the furnace\n4. Increased spacing from furnace by placing at y=28.5\n\nThis should avoid the collision with the stone furnace while still maintaining a functional setup.", "summary_range": "[1-330]"}
