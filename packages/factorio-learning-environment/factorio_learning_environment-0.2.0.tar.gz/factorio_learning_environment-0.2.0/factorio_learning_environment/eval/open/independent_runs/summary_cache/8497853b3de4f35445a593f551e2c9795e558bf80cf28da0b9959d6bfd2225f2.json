{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) via a Transport Belt at positions (-25.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -65.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -66.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) via a Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Systems\n- BeltGroup at positions (-25.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -65.5) directing resources from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- BeltGroup at positions (-24.5, -64.5) to (-22.5, -64.5) for resource movement.\n- BeltGroup at positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5) for resource movement.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Entities\n- Ensure the entity you want to pick up exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. Double-check the coordinates and the entity's presence.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Transport Belts\n- Avoid attempting to connect transport belts when the object is not properly initialized or is a 'NoneType'. Ensure that the belt entities are correctly instantiated and positioned before connecting them.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity or a clear path for outputs from mining drills to prevent blockage. Regularly check and clear any items on the ground that might obstruct the output path."}
