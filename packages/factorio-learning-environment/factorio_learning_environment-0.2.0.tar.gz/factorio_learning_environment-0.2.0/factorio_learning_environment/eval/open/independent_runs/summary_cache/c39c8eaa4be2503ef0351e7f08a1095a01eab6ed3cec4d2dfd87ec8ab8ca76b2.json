{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to two Wooden Chests at positions (x=52.5, y=-84.5) and (x=54.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) with output to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) supplied by a Burner Inserter at position (x=-19.5, y=-61.5) with input from a Wooden Chest at position (x=-18.5, y=-61.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and a Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with input from multiple Wooden Chests for copper ore storage.\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=1.5, y=1.5) to (x=3.5, y=1.5) and (x=2.5, y=1.5) to (x=4.5, y=1.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. In the case of the stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), the inventory was full, causing insertion failure.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from inserters. The inserter at position (x=-19.5, y=-61.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) were blocked due to no available space in the destination."}
