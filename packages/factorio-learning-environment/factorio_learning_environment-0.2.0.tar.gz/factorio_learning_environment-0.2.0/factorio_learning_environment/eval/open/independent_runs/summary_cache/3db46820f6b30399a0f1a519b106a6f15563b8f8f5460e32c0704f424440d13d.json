{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) assisting in the transfer process.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-11.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-9.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, connected to an iron chest at position (41.5, -80.5).\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) potentially using coal for smelting.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring coal from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to transfer. Regularly check and replenish the source if necessary.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to take items from a chest before connecting them with transport belts. Direct connections from a chest to belts are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to full chests blocking mining drills\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage. This ensures continuous resource extraction.\n\n### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are continuously supplied with raw materials to maintain production efficiency. Regularly check and restock the input resources for the furnaces."}
