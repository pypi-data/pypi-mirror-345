{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), refueled with coal, extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), containing iron ore, currently low on ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace, refueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), aligned with the chest and inserter, refueled with coal but not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from player position\n- Ensure the player is within a 10-tile distance from the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with insufficient spacing or incorrect direction\n- Verify there is enough space and the correct direction is set before placing entities like inserters. Consider adjusting the spacing or direction to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors due to inserter misalignment\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can effectively transfer items between entities. Adjust positions if necessary to ensure smooth operation.\n\n### Errors due to chest being full\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Consider extracting items or expanding storage capacity.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Keep track of fuel levels in entities like mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Refuel them promptly to avoid interruptions."}
