{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). \n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position (0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace at position (5, 5)\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-8.5, -7.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes forming a fluid system for transporting liquids.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-4.5, 19.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes forming a fluid system for transporting water.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-14.5, 23.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes forming a fluid system that is currently empty.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-18.5, 25.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes forming a fluid system that is currently empty.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-20.5, 29.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes forming a fluid system that is currently empty.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-21.5, 28.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes forming a fluid system that is currently empty.\n\n### ElectricityGroup at position(-4.5, 13.5)\nConsists of multiple small electric poles providing power to nearby entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with incorrect object usage\n- Ensure that when using objects, you are accessing their properties correctly. For example, avoid using subscripting on objects that do not support it (e.g., 'Pipe' object).\n- Always verify that the second argument in function calls requiring a Position object is indeed a Position object and not a different type."}
