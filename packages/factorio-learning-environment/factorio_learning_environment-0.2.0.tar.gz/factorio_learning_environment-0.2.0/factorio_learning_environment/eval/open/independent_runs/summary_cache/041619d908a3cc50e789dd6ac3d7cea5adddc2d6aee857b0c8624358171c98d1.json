{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-23, -68)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belts at positions (-24.5, -69.5), (-23.5, -69.5), (-22.5, -69.5), (-21.5, -69.5), (-21.5, -68.5), (-24.5, -66.5), (-23.5, -66.5), (-21.5, -67.5), (-21.5, -66.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-14, -53)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belts at positions (-14.5, -54.5), (-15.5, -54.5), (-12.5, -54.5), (-13.5, -54.5), (-15.5, -52.5), (-15.5, -53.5), (-12.5, -53.5), (-14.5, -51.5), (-15.5, -51.5), (-12.5, -51.5), (-13.5, -51.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-19, -65)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-21, -62)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Belts\n- Ensure that the belts are correctly aligned and positioned to connect. The error indicates a failure to connect transport belts at positions (-22.5, -69.5) and (-21.5, -69.5). Verify that the belts are facing the correct direction and are adjacent to each other.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. The inserters at positions (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) are waiting for source items. Check if the belts or chests feeding these inserters are supplying the required items.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. The burner mining drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) is out of fuel. Regularly check and refuel these entities to maintain continuous operation."}
