{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a report summarizing the structures and error tips.\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex at (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Transport belt at (-29.5, -59.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5) containing iron and copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0)\n- Additional burner inserters and chests for output handling\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10.0, -59.0)\nLarge mining setup consisting of:\n- Three connected burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), and (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Transport belt network connecting the drills\n- Multiple wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) for ore storage\n- Multiple burner inserters for material movement\n- Complex belt system for ore transportation\n\n### Smelting Array at (0.0, 0.0)\nLarge smelting facility consisting of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5) containing iron plates\n- Multiple burner inserters for automated material movement between chests and furnaces\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory-related errors\n- Before attempting to insert items, ensure you have the required items in your inventory\n- Check inventory contents before performing insert operations\n\n### Inserter placement issues\n- Some inserters are showing \"output blocked\" warnings - ensure proper placement of destination entities\n- When setting up inserter chains, verify that each inserter has both valid pickup and drop-off points\n\n### Furnace operation issues\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper material flow through inserters and belts\n- Verify that input inserters are properly configured to supply materials to furnaces\n\n### Entity connection issues\n- When building automated systems, ensure all components (belts, inserters, chests) are properly connected\n- Verify that transport belts form continuous paths without gaps"}
