Ensure the correct attributes are being accessed.\n\n### Errors Due to Not Being Close Enough to Place Entities\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place entities. Ensure the distance is within the allowable range.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Items in Inventory\n- Ensure the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors in Manual Pipe Connection\n- Ensure the correct attributes and methods are used when manually connecting pipes. Check for valid connection points.\n\n### Errors Due to Not Connected Entities\n- Ensure all entities are properly connected to their respective networks, such as power or fluid networks, to function correctly."}
