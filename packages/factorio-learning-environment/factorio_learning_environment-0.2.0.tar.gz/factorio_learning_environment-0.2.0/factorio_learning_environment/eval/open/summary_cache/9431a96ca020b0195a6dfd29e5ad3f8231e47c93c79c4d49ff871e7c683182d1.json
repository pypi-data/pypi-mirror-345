{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5), facing down, currently powered via electric poles but output blocked due to no sink entity.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0), fueled with coal and smelting iron ore.\n- Wooden chests at positions (16.5, 75.5), (18.5, 76.5), (19.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) intended for output collection and storage, though some placement attempts failed due to collisions.\n- Transport belt at position (20.5, 75.5) extending iron plate transport.\n- Small electric poles connecting the electric mining drill to the power source network.\n\n### Electricity generator at position around (0.5, 6.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), fueled with coal, connected to offshore pump by pipes.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), connected to boiler by pipes.\n- Small electric poles near boiler and steam engine providing power network connectivity.\n\nThe electricity generator structure supplies power to the electric mining drill and other electric entities via a network of small electric poles spanning from the generator to the drill.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to item insertion into entities\n- The attempt to insert coal into the electric mining drill failed with \"Could not insert: LuaItemStack\". Ensure the target entity supports the item type and has capacity before insertion.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect attribute access on electricity groups\n- Accessing `.energy` attribute on an ElectricityGroup caused AttributeError. Instead, check power availability on individual electric poles or entities, not on the group object.\n\n### Power supply issues for electric mining drill\n- Electric mining drill reported NO_POWER and \"not receiving electricity\" warnings initially due to incomplete power network connection. This was resolved by placing and connecting small electric poles to the steam engine power source.\n\n### Placement conflicts and collisions\n- Multiple attempts to place wooden chests near the stone furnace failed due to existing entities occupying the target tiles or insufficient spacing. Similarly, placing a burner inserter next to the furnace failed due to chest collision.\n- Attempts to place transport belts at certain positions failed because of existing objects blocking placement.\n- To mitigate these, verify the target tile is free and has sufficient spacing before placement. Consider adjusting direction, spacing, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Fuel and power network warnings on boiler and steam engine\n- Boiler ran out of fuel causing NO_FUEL status; ensure continuous coal supply.\n- Steam engine showed warnings such as \"not connected to power network\" and \"no input liquid\". Confirm proper pipe connections and fuel supply to maintain operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
