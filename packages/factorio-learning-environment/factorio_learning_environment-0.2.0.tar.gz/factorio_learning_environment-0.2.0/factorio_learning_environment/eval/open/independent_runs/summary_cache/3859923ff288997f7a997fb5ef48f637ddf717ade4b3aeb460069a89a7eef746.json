{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with key positions including (-9.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and (-1.5, 22.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) which is responsible for moving items into the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) for storage of finished goods\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles, including positions such as (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), and (0.5, 21.5), providing power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a functioning power source. Check the connections between inserters and electric poles to ensure they are properly linked and that the electric network is active.\n\n### Errors with No Research in Progress in Labs\n- Make sure to assign research tasks to labs to keep them operational. Check the lab's input inventory to ensure it has the necessary science packs for research.\n\n### Errors with Electrical Network Voltage\n- Verify that the electricity network has sufficient power generation to meet demand. Check the status of power generators and ensure they are fueled and operational."}
