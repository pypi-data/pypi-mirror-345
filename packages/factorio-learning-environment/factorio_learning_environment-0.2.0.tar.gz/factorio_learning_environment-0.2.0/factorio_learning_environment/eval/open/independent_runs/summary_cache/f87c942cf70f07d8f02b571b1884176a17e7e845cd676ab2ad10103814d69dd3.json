Common non-buildable tiles include water, cliffs, or occupied spaces.\n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- The agent attempted to use `central_storage` without defining it. Ensure all variables are properly initialized before use. For example, define `central_storage` or use `central_storage_pos` if it exists.\n\n#### Errors when inserting fuel into entities\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., burner inserter or mining drill) is within range and has a valid fuel slot before inserting coal or other fuel items.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., furnace or chest) has items available for extraction before attempting to extract. For example, furnaces must have smelted items ready.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure the agent has sufficient resources in its inventory before attempting to craft items like iron gear wheels. Check the inventory for required materials (e.g., iron plates)."}
