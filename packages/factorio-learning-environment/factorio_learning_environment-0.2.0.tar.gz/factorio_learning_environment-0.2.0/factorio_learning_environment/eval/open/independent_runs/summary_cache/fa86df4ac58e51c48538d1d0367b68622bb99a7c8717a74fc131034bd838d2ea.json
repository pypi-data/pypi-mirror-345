{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position(x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and a warning indicating \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and a warning indicating \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to move Stone Furnace\n- Ensure that the target position for moving the Stone Furnace is valid and not already occupied by another entity. Verify the presence of the Stone Furnace at the specified position before attempting to move it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Before placing any entity such as Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, or Transport Belt, confirm that the desired location is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Verify the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it using the `get_entity` function. Ensure that the position coordinates are accurate and correspond to the actual location of the entity on the map.\n\n### Warnings about blocked outputs and missing sink entities\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage. Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to maintain efficiency.\n\n### Warnings about furnaces with no ingredients\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients available for smelting. Regularly supply the furnace with the required raw materials to prevent idle time and maximize production."}
