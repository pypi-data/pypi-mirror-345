{"content": "I understand the situation better now. Let me analyze what we've learned:\n\nAnalysis Report:\n\n1. Current Situation:\n- We have a burner mining drill that's blocked (waiting for output space)\n- Our inventory contains:\n  * 1 stone furnace\n  * 25 coal\n  * 80 stone\n  * 50 iron ore\n  * 1 iron plate\n\n2. Key Issues Encountered:\n- Cannot craft wooden chests directly as wood is a raw resource\n- The mining drill is blocked due to full output\n- We need to find alternative storage solutions\n\n3. Lessons Learned:\n- Wood is a raw resource that must be gathered, not crafted\n- We should check available resources before attempting crafting\n- We need to verify recipe requirements before attempting to craft\n\n4. Successful Patterns:\n- Using get_entities() to check current game state\n- Checking inventory before operations\n- Moving to specific positions before interactions\n\n5. Recommendations for Future:\n- Always check if materials are raw resources or craftable\n- Implement error handling for crafting operations\n- Consider alternative storage solutions when wooden chests aren't available\n- Use iron chests if available instead of wooden chests\n- Check recipe requirements before attempting to craft\n\nWould you like me to try a different approach that doesn't rely on wooden chests, or should we first gather some wood for chest crafting?", "summary_range": "[1-106]"}
