Subsequent attempts with fluid_system IDs [4236, 4279, 4322, 4365, 4408, 4451, 4494, 4537] also failed, and the final map shows additional PipeGroups with fluid_system IDs [4580, 4581, 4582, 4587, 4586, 4591, 4590, 4593]. Connection remains incomplete.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 PipeGroup Availability and Merge Failures:\n  - Validate that a working PipeGroup is available before initiating pipeline connections. Repeated failures\u2014previously with fluid_system IDs [2172, 2215, 2258, 2301, 2344, 2387, 2430, 2473; 2516, 2559, 2602, 2645, 2688, 2731, 2774, 2817; 2860, 2903, 2946, 2989, 3032, 3075, 3118, 3161; 3204, 3247, 3290, 3333, 3376, 3419, 3462, 3505; 3548, 3591, 3634, 3677, 3720, 3763, 3806, 3849; 3892, 3935, 3978, 4021, 4064, 4107, 4150, 4193] and, most recently, [4236, 4279, 4322, 4365, 4408, 4451, 4494, 4537]\u2014indicate that the fluid network\u2019s readiness must be confirmed prior to connection attempts.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Placement Obstructions:\n  - Ensure that all target connection endpoints are unobstructed before attempting pipe placements.\n\n\u2022 Multi\u2010Segment Pipeline Connection Challenges:\n  - Verify that intermediate waypoints precisely align with both the source and target endpoints to secure a successful multi\u2010segment connection.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connection Configuration:\n  - Confirm that the steam engine\u2019s fluid input, its connection points, and the operational status of nearby PipeGroups are correctly configured before initiating a connection."}
