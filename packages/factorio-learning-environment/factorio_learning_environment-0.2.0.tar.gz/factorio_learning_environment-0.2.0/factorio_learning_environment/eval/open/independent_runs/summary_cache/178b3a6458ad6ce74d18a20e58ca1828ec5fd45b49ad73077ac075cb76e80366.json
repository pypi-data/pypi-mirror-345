{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Coal (40000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (81 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing entities like Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters is unoccupied before attempting to place them. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drills\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or a conveyor belt, to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage and maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Operation without Ingredients\n- Make sure to supply the furnace with the necessary ingredients to smelt materials. This will prevent the furnace from being idle and ensure efficient production of iron plates."}
