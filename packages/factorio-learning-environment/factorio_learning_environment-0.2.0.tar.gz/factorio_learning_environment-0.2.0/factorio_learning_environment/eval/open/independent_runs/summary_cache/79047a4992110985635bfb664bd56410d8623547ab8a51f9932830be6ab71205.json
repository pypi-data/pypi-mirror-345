{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled by coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the next stage.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the burner inserter to the furnace, facilitating the movement of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors When Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly monitor and empty storage entities like chests to prevent blockages in the production line. The chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) was full, causing a warning and potential disruption in mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure that the item is available in the inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the quantities of various items in the agent's possession.\n- `furnace`: Entity - Represents the furnace entity, used for processing raw materials into finished goods."}
