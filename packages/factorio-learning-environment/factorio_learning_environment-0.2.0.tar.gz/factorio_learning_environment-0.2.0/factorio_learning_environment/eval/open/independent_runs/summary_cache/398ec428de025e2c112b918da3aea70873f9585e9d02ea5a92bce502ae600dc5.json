{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), refueled and operational, with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0), currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), and (44.5, -80.5) for storage, with varying inventories of coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring materials between entities.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), refueled and operational, with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0), all with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storage, with varying inventories of iron ore and coal.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-11.5, -49.5), (-10.5, -49.5), and (-8.5, -49.5) for transferring materials between entities.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chests at positions (-12.5, -45.5), (-10.5, -45.5), and (-8.5, -45.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) for transferring iron plates between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place an entity where one already exists\n- Ensure that the target position for placing a new entity is clear of existing entities to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory in chests\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests to ensure they do not become full, as this can block production and inserter operations.\n\n### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting to interact with them to prevent errors related to missing entities.\n\n### Errors due to blocked inserter output\n- Ensure that there is a valid destination for inserter outputs to prevent blockages and maintain efficient material flow."}
