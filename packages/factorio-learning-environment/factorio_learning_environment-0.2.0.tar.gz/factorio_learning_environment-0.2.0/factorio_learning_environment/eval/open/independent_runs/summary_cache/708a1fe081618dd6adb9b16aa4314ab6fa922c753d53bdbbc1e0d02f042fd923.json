{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 22.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 22.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) to function correctly.\n\n### Inserter Full Chest Warning\n- Make sure to manage the output inventory to prevent inserters from being unable to place items due to full chests, particularly at position (17.5, 0.5).\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0) have the necessary ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors in Research\n- Avoid attempting to set research on a technology that is already researched, as seen with the Automation technology.\n\n### TypeError in Position Calculation\n- When calculating positions, ensure that all operands are of compatible types to avoid errors like \"unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and 'ModelPrivateAttr'\".\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Inventory\n- Before placing entities like burner mining drills, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- When crafting items like burner mining drills, ensure that all sub-ingredients are available. For example, stone is a raw resource and must be gathered before crafting stone furnaces, which are needed for burner mining drills."}
