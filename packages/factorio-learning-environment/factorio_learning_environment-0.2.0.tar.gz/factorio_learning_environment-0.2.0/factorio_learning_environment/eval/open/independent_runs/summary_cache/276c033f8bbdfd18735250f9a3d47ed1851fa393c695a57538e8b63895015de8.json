{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Water Extraction and Power Generation Setup (near x=-9, y=71 and x=73, y=69)\n\nThis setup extracts water and uses it to generate steam power.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=71.5): Extracts water from the lake.\n*   **PipeGroup** starting at (x=-8.5, y=71.5): Transports water from the Offshore Pump to the Boilers. Consists of multiple pipe segments connecting (x=-8.5, y=71.5) to (x=69.5, y=71.5).\n*   **Boiler** at position (x=71.5, y=71.0): Heats water into steam (currently out of fuel). Connected to the water pipe network.\n*   **Boiler** at position (x=74.5, y=71."}
