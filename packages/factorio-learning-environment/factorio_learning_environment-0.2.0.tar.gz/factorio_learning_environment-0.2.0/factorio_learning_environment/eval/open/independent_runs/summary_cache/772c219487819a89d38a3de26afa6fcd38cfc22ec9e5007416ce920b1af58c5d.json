{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully placed. The agent made repeated attempts to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) but was unable to place one due to missing Lab items and cascading crafting failures. Although smelting operations were performed using furnaces located at (5.0, 5.0) for iron and (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper, these entities were pre\u2010existing and not newly created by the agent\u2019s actions.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage\n\u2003\u2013 When retrieving entities, ensure that you use the correct parameter types. Do not pass unsupported keyword arguments (for example, avoid using \u201cradius\u201d if it is not defined) and do not supply extra positional arguments if the function accepts none.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Checks\n\u2003\u2013 Check that the required items (such as a Lab) are present in the inventory before attempting to place them.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify available resources and prerequisites prior to launching placement operations.\n\n\u2022 Handling Function Returns\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that functions returning collections (like get_entities) do not return None before iterating over the results.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Dependencies\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all sub-components needed for crafting (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables) are available or producible. Establish the necessary production chain (including proper smelting setups) before attempting to craft advanced items like a Lab."}
