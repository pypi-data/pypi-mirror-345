"""
This module contains unit tests for the `cli_talk` command-line interface, focusing on audio processing, text
communication, and utility functions.

The tests are organized to validate the functionality of various methods, including `flush_queue`,
`fuzzy_digit_cleanup`, `word_digits_to_numbers`, `combine_consecutive_digits`, `normalize_issue_references`,
`initialize_recognizer`, `process_audio_data`, and `process_text_and_communicate`. Each test case utilizes the `pytest`
framework and incorporates mock objects to simulate dependencies, ensuring that functions respond correctly to both
expected inputs and edge cases.

Key functions tested include:
- `test_flush_queue_empty_exception`: Tests exception handling for an empty queue in `flush_queue`.
- `test_do_once`: Verifies the return value of the `do_once` function.
- `test_cli_exec`: Tests execution of the CLI talk function.
- `test_fuzzy_digit_cleanup`: Validates the fuzzy digit cleanup functionality.
- `test_word_digits_to_numbers`: Checks conversion of word digits to numerical representation.
- `test_combine_consecutive_digits`: Ensures consecutive digits are combined correctly.
- `test_normalize_issue_references`: Tests normalization of issue references in text.
- `test_flush_queue`: Verifies the flushing of the queue.
- `test_suppress_stderr`: Tests suppression of standard error output.
- `test_initialize_recognizer`: Ensures correct initialization of the recognizer.
- `test_process_text_and_communicate`: Tests processing of text and communication with AI.
- `test_process_audio_data`: Validates audio data processing for various scenarios.
- `test_cli_talk`: Tests the main CLI talk function with different audio inputs.

The module also includes a fixture, `cli_talk_mocks`, which sets up mock objects for testing CLI talk functionality,
allowing for controlled testing of the command line interactions and audio processing logic.
