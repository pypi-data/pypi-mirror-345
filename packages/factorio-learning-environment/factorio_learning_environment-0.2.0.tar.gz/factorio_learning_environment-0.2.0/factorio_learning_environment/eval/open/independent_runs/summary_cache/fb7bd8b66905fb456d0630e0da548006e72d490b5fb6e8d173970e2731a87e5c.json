{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) connected to wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0)\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\n- Assembling machine at (24.5, 4.5)\n- Input chest at (21.5, 4.5) containing iron plates\n- Output chest at (27.5, 4.5) containing copper plates and science packs\n- Burner inserters at (22.5, 4.5) and (26.5, 4.5) connecting chests to assembler\n\n### Power Generation System (Under Construction)\n- Steam engine at (-5.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.0, 23.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting components:\n  - Water pipe system at (-6.5, 21.5)\n  - Steam pipe system at (-7.5, 15.5)\n  - Main pipe network at (-6.5, 19.5) connecting various components\n\n### Research Area\nMultiple labs positioned across the map, currently not powered\n\n### Electrical Distribution\nElectric pole network spanning from (-1.5, 18.5) to (31.5, 18.5), currently not energized\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Pipe Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing pipes - many attempts to place pipes where entities already exist\n- Ensure terrain is suitable for pipe placement - some attempts to place pipes on unplaceable terrain (water)\n- When connecting pipe systems, ensure proper spacing and no overlapping with existing structures\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Power network is not receiving electricity due to:\n  - Boiler has no fuel\n  - Steam engine not receiving steam\n  - Incomplete or incorrectly connected pipe network\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure required fuel (coal) is available before attempting to insert into machines\n- Keep track of inventory requirements for power generation system\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- Verify all fluid-carrying entities (boilers, steam engines, pipes) are properly connected in sequence\n- Ensure proper spacing between components of the power generation system"}
