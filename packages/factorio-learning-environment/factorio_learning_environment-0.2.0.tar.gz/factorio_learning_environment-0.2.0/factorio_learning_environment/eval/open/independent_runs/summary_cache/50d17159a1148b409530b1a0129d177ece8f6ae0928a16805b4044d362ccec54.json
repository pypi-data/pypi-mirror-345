{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Additional Structures\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Lab with no power\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, all with status EMPTY\n- Electricity Group with poles at multiple positions, voltage 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler Connection\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to a water source. Check the connection points and ensure pipes are correctly placed to establish a connection.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Verify the presence of pipes at the intended positions before attempting to connect entities. Ensure that pipes are placed at the correct coordinates to facilitate fluid transfer.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are connected to a power network. Check the connections between poles and other electrical entities to ensure power distribution.\n\n### Errors with Ingredient Supply\n- Make sure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Supply the required materials to avoid production halts."}
