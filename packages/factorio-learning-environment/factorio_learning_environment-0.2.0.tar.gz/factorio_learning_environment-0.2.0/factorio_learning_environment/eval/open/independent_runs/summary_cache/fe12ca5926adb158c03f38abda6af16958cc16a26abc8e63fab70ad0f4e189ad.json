{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) - no fuel\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) with 4 coal and 20 iron plates\nSystem not operational due to lack of fuel in drill\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting System at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) - no fuel\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) with 2 coal and 14 copper plates\nSystem not operational due to lack of fuel in drill\n\n### Power Generation System at (-14.5, 19.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) with 20 coal\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 16.5) facing DOWN\n- Multiple disconnected pipe groups scattered across the map\nSystem not operational due to connection issues\n\n### Research Lab System\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs (10)\nCurrently not operational due to no power\n\n### Unused Smelting Area\nGroup of 4 unused furnaces at:\n- (0.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 4.0)\n- (4.0, 4.0)\nAll have fuel (23 coal each) but no ingredients\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nElectric pole network (Group ID 5184) connecting various areas but currently not operational (0 voltage)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Steam engine must face UP, not DOWN\n- Place steam engine at position (-14.5, 12.5) to align with boiler's steam output at (-14.5, 17.0)\n- Create direct pipe connections without multiple pipe groups\n\n### Pipe System Management\n- Remove ALL existing pipe groups before creating new connections\n- Create single direct connections:\n  1. One connection from pump to boiler water input\n  2. One connection from boiler steam output to steam engine\n- Avoid creating multiple scattered pipe groups\n\n### Entity Placement Order\nFollow strict placement order:\n1. Place and fuel boiler\n2. Place steam engine with correct orientation (UP) and position\n3. Create water connection (pump to boiler)\n4. Create steam connection (boiler to engine)\n\n### Resource Management\n- Current inventory shows excessive pipes (2351) while lacking other essential resources\n- Maintain fuel levels in mining drills\n- Consider crafting essential items instead of stockpiling basic materials\n\n### System Verification\n- Verify fluid connections are properly established before adding new components\n- Check entity warnings and status after each connection\n- Ensure power network is properly connected to steam engine"}
