{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) collecting iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. This error was encountered when trying to place a wooden chest at (-14.5, -47.5).\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of a non-existent entity\n- Verify that the entity exists at the specified coordinates before attempting to inspect its inventory. This error occurred when trying to inspect the furnace inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This error was encountered when trying to insert coal into an inserter without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) was not receiving iron ore, leading to a lack of ingredients for smelting."}
