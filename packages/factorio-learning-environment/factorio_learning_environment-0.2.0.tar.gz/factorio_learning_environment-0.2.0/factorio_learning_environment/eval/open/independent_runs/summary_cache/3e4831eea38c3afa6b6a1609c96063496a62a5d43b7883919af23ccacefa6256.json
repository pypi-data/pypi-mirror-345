{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Structure at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch. Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining until the chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is emptied.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore. Currently contains 9 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. Currently working but requires refueling.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Converts iron ore into iron plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Refueling Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Reposition and align inserters as necessary to maintain efficient transfer.\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters with coal to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Mining Drill and Chest Management\n- Ensure that the mining drill is adequately fueled to maintain continuous extraction of resources.\n- Regularly check the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to ensure it is not full. Empty the chest to prevent mining operations from stopping.\n\n### Furnace Input Management\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to continue smelting operations. Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are functioning correctly to transfer materials into the furnace.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters as needed. Harvest additional coal from nearby resources if inventory levels are low."}
