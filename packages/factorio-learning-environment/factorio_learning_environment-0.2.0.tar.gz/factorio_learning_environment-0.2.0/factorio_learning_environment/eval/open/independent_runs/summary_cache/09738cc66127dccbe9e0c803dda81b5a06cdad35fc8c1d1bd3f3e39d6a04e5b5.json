{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of Transport Belts and a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions: (-24.5, -69.5), (-22.5, -69.5), (-21.5, -69.5), (-21.5, -68.5), (-24.5, -67.5), (-24.5, -66.5), (-23.5, -66.5), (-21.5, -66.5), (-21.5, -67.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) connected to a Transport Belt system.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing Iron Plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a series of Transport Belts and a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions: (-15.5, -54.5), (-14.5, -54.5), (-13.5, -54.5), (-12.5, -54.5), (-15.5, -53.5), (-15.5, -52.5), (-12.5, -53.5), (-15.5, -51.5), (-14.5, -51.5), (-13.5, -51.5), (-12.5, -51.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure the path length between the source and destination positions is valid when connecting transport belts. Avoid attempting to connect belts to the same position or to positions that result in an invalid path length.\n\n### Errors with Attempting to Index a Nil Value\n- Verify that all variables and positions used in function calls are properly initialized and not nil before attempting operations. This will prevent errors related to indexing nil values."}
