{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup near position (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5), facing down, currently powered and working but with output blocked due to no sink entity.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0), fueled with coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 75.5) used as output chest for the furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (19.5, 75.5) near the furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 76.5) near the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (20.5, 75.5), with spacing=1, moving iron plates from furnace to chest, fueled with coal.\n- Small electric pole at position (17.5, 69.5) connected to power the electric mining drill.\n\n### Steam power generation setup near positions (-9.5, -0.5) to (0.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5), working and connected to water source.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), fueled with coal and generating steam.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), generating electricity from steam.\n- Small electric poles near steam engine at position (0.5, 3.5) and near boiler at position (-4.5, -0.5), connected to form an electricity network.\n- Electricity group connecting poles near drill and power generation setup, providing power to electric mining drill.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inserting items into entities\n- Avoid attempting to insert items into entities incorrectly or when the entity cannot accept the item. For example, the error \"Could not insert: LuaItemStack\" occurred when trying to insert coal into the drill. Ensure the target entity supports the item and has capacity before inserting.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect attribute access on electricity groups\n- The error \"ElectricityGroup object has no attribute 'energy'\" indicates misuse of API properties. Instead of checking 'energy' on electricity groups, check individual poles or generators for energy status.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Multiple errors occurred when placing wooden chests at positions already occupied by other entities. Always verify the target tile is free before placing an entity.\n- When placing entities next to others (e.g., placing chest next to furnace), consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n- If placement fails repeatedly, scan for existing entities nearby and choose alternative placement spots.\n\n### Errors placing inserters next to entities already occupied by chests\n- When placing burner inserters next to furnaces, ensure the target tile is not occupied by a chest or other entity. Adjust spacing or direction to find a valid placement.\n\n### Power connection and supply errors\n- The electric mining drill initially had no power due to lack of connected power sources. Ensure power poles are connected to active power generators.\n- After connecting the power network, the drill status changed to working but with warnings about output blockage. Always provide a proper output sink (e.g., chest or belt) to accept mined items to avoid blocking.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
