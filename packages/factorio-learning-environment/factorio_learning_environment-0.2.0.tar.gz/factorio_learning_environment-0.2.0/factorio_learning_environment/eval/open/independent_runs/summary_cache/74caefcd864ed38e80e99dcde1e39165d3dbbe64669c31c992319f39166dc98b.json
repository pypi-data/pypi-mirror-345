{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a transport belt system to move mined coal.\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions, including (41.5, -85.5), (41.5, -84.5), (41.5, -83.5), and (41.5, -82.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5) for moving coal from the transport belt to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -81.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) for moving items from a transport belt to a chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) for storing items transported by the belt.\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various positions, facilitating the transport of materials across the map. These include:\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (50.5, -86.5) and outputs at (49.5, -86.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (54.5, -86.5) and outputs at (52.5, -82.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting positions around (41.5, -85.5) and (41.5, -80.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Alignment\n- Ensure that transport belts are correctly aligned to facilitate the movement of items. Misaligned belts can cause inserters to wait for source items, as seen with the inserter at position (40.5, -82.5).\n\n### AttributeError with BeltGroup\n- When accessing attributes of BeltGroup objects, verify that the attribute exists. The error \"AttributeError: 'BeltGroup' object has no attribute 'direction'\" suggests checking the available attributes of BeltGroup before accessing them.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnace\n- Before attempting to extract items from a furnace, ensure that the furnace contains the desired items. The error \"Could not extract iron-plate from stone-furnace at (-15.0, -49.0)\" indicates that the furnace did not have the expected items.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"output blocked by item on the ground\" by ensuring there is a sink entity to accept the output from mining drills or other production entities."}
