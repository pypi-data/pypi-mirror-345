{"content": "Ah, I see the issue now. The iron_pos is a Position object, not a tuple. Let's correct the code:\n\n```python\n# First find iron ore\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Found iron ore at {iron_pos}\")\n\n# Move to iron location\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# Mine some iron ore manually\nharvest_resource(iron_pos, quantity=10)\nprint(\"Harvested iron ore\")\n\n# Place furnace nearby (2 tiles to the right of iron ore)\nfurnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=Position(x=iron_pos.x + 2, y=iron_pos.y))\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n# Add iron ore to furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=10)\nprint(\"Added iron ore to furnace\")\n\n# Wait for smelting\nprint(\"Waiting for smelting...\")\nsleep(5)\n\n# Check furnace contents\nfurnace_contents = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace contents: {furnace_contents}\")\n\n# Extract iron plates if they're ready\nif Prototype.IronPlate in furnace_contents:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, quantity=furnace_contents[Prototype.IronPlate])\n    print(\"Extracted iron plates\")\n\n# Check our updated inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inventory}\")\n```\n\nKey lessons learned:\n1. Position objects have .x and .y attributes instead of being indexable\n2. We need to properly handle the Position object when placing entities\n3. It's good practice to check if items exist in inventory before trying to extract them\n4. The furnace needs both fuel (coal) and ingredients (iron ore) to work\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to explain any part of this code in more detail!", "summary_range": "[1-2186]"}
