{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing transferred coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to the stone furnace.\n\n### Additional Inserters\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, with a wooden chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) as a neighbor.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or belt) contains items for the inserter to transfer. Check for blockages or missing items in the source entity.\n- Regularly monitor and manage inventory levels in chests to prevent inserters from idling due to lack of source items.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly empty chests that are used as drop-off points for mining drills to prevent interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has a continuous supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to maintain production efficiency. Regularly check and refill the furnace source inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
