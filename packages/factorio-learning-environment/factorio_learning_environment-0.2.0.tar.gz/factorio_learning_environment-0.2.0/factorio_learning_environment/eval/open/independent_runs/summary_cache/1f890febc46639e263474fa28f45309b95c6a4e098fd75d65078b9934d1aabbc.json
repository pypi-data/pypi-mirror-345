{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A furnace that converts iron ore and coal into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at position (-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A furnace that converts copper ore and coal into copper plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 Incorrect get_entities usage  \n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, avoid unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) and do not pass positional arguments if none are expected. Verify the function\u2019s parameter requirements before calling.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement and iteration issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Before placing a Lab, confirm that a Lab is available in the inventory.  \n\u2003\u2013 When retrieving Lab entities, use a fallback such as an empty list if the call returns None to prevent iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting ingredient shortfalls  \n\u2003\u2013 Several Lab crafting attempts failed due to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables).  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all prerequisite resources and intermediate products are available in sufficient quantities before attempting Lab crafting."}
