{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum allowed distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is not occupied by another entity or obstructed by terrain features like water. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Inserter alignment and functionality issues\n- Double-check the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning properly.\n\n### Fuel management for entities\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like burner inserters and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Ensure you have enough fuel in your inventory to refuel these entities as needed.\n\n### Chest management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly extract items from the chest to free up space.\n\n### Furnace input issues\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. Verify the setup of inserters and the availability of resources in the chest to maintain a steady supply to the furnace."}
