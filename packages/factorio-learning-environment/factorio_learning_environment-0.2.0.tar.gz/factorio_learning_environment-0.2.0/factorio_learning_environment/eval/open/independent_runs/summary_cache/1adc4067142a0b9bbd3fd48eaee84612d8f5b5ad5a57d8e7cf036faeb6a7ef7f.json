{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a new report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System at (-80, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) configured to:\n  - Pick up from (41.5, -80.5)\n  - Drop off at (43.5, -80.5)\n- Stone furnace at (44.0, -80.0)\n\nCurrent operational status:\n- Mining drill is working with 17 coal as fuel\n- Chest contains 496 coal\n- Inserter is waiting for source items\n- Furnace has no ingredients but is fully fueled (50 coal)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Before placing entities, verify there is sufficient clear space for the entire entity footprint\n- Consider the size of entities when planning placement:\n  - Furnaces are 2x2\n  - Inserters are 1x1\n  - Mining drills are 2x2\n\n### Entity Alignment Issues\n- Ensure inserter drop-off points align precisely with furnace input positions\n- When repositioning structures, remove all connected entities first before placing new ones\n- Pay attention to the exact coordinates and direction of entities during placement\n\n### Terrain Placement Restrictions\n- Check if the terrain is suitable for entity placement (avoid water tiles)\n- Verify the ground can support the intended structure before attempting placement\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  - Success: Returns placed entity\n  - Failure: Throws exception when placement location is blocked or invalid\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace: Entity (stone-furnace)\n- inserter: Entity (burner-inserter)\n- mining_drill: Entity (burner-mining-drill)\n- chest: Entity (wooden-chest)"}
