{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\n### Additional Iron Furnaces\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. For instance, the chest at position (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) need to be emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to avoid them idling. For example, the furnaces at positions (-11.0, -48.0) and (-9.0, -48.0) have warnings for no ingredients to smelt."}
