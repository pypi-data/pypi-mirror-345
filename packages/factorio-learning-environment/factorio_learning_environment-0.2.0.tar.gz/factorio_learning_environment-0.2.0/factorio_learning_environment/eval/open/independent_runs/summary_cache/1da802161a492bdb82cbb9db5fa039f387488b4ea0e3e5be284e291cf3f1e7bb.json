{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups, but some pipes are not connected properly, causing warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace at (6.0, -62.0) and a Wooden Chest at (6.5, -59.5) for transferring items.\n\n### Storage and Miscellaneous\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) containing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates and copper plates.\n- Lab with no research in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure all pipes are properly connected to allow fluid flow. Check the connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to resolve 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections' warnings.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in inventory before attempting to refuel entities. The error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The warning 'no ingredients to smelt' suggests that the required input materials are missing.\n\n### Errors in Mining Operations\n- Ensure that the chest connected to the mining drill is not full to avoid halting mining operations. The warning 'chest at drop position is full' indicates that the chest needs to be emptied to continue mining."}
