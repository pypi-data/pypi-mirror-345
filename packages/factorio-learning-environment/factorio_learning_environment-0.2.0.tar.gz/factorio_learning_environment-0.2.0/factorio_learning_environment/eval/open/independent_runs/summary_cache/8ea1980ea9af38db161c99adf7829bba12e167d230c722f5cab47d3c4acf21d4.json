{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace with a fuel inventory of coal, status indicating no ingredients to smelt, and a full fuel source. Produces iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Group\nConsists of:\n- Pipes at positions (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5). The system is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of:\n- Electric poles at various positions including (x=-7.5, y=17.5), (x=-6.5, y=16.5), (x=-8.5, y=16.5), (x=0.5, y=18.5), (x=1.5, y=18.5), and (x=-8.5, y=20.5). The system is currently not providing voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors with unsuitable positions for placing entities\n- Verify that the position is suitable for the entity you are trying to place. This includes checking for any obstructions or terrain issues.\n\n### Errors with connecting entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and correctly aligned. For example, when connecting pipes, make sure they are correctly positioned to form a continuous path.\n\n### Errors with invalid data types\n- When handling data, ensure that you are using the correct data types. For instance, converting strings to integers should only be done when the string is a valid representation of a number.\n\n### Errors with moving to new areas\n- Confirm that the coordinates or indices you are using to move are valid and correctly formatted."}
