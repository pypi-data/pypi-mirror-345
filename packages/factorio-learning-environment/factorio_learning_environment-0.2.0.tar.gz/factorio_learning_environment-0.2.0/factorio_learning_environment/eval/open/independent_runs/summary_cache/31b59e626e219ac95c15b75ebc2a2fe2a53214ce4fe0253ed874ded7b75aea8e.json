{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt, currently holding 51 iron plates.\n- Inserter at position (x=17.5, y=0.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a small electric pole at position (x=17.5, y=-0.5).\n- Inserter at position (x=16.5, y=0.5) not receiving electricity, connected to the stone furnace and a small electric pole.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=18.5, y=0.5) with normal status.\n\n### Pipe Infrastructure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-12.5, y=19.5), status empty, connecting various points including (x=-12.5, y=19.5) to (x=-5.5, y=23.5).\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5), status empty, connecting points including (x=-8.5, y=23.5) to (x=-7.5, y=24.5).\n\n### Electricity Infrastructure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=-12.5, y=15.5) to (x=1.5, y=25.5), currently with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when setting up mining drills and chests\n- Ensure that the correct variable or entity name is used when setting up mining drills and chests. The error indicates 'mining_drill' is not defined.\n\n### Errors when supplying furnaces\n- Verify that the correct variable or entity name is used when supplying furnaces. The error indicates 'ore_chest' is not defined.\n\n### Errors when setting up power infrastructure\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. The error indicates a failure to connect pipes at specific coordinates.\n\n### Errors with existing small electric poles\n- Check for existing small electric poles at the required position before attempting to place a new one to avoid redundancy.\n\n### Errors when connecting power to inserters\n- Ensure that the steam engine is correctly placed and connected to provide power to inserters. The error indicates no entity of type steam-engine found at the specified position."}
