{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n\nThis facility is designed to extract iron ore using the burner mining drill, which deposits the ore into the wooden chest. The stone furnace is used to smelt the extracted iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing a Burner Inserter is not occupied by another entity or obstructed. Adjust the position accordingly before attempting to place the inserter.\n\n### NameError for Undefined Variable\n- Ensure that all variables are correctly defined before use. In the case of `chest_inserter`, verify that the variable is declared and initialized properly.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts\n- When attempting to connect belts, ensure that an inserter is used to transfer items from a wooden chest, as belts cannot connect directly to a chest.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure there is coal available in the inventory before trying to insert it into a mining drill."}
