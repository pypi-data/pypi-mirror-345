{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, with burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) feeding the chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational.\n- Output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation persists despite partial clearing of furnace output.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, though output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power network via small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5), currently working.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), replaced after removal to free space.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) placed and fueled with coal, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine input inventory intermittently stocked with iron plates and output inventory with iron gear wheels, but output chest remains empty indicating possible extraction issues.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and output inserter setup, with input materials supplied, but assembled items are not being extracted into the output chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Output blockage at furnace and mining drill\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report output blockage due to the furnace output belt being full or blocked.\n- The stone furnace at (18.0, 75.0) frequently has full output inventory preventing further smelting output.\n- To resolve this, extend or clear the output belts and ensure downstream chests or belts have capacity to accept iron plates.\n- Regularly monitor and manage output inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently have sufficient coal and are operational.\n- Previous issues with inserters running out of fuel or having full inventories have been mitigated.\n- Continue to monitor inserter fuel levels and source/destination inventories to maintain smooth operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembler output extraction failure\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) has input iron plates and output iron gear wheels in its inventories, but the output chest at (25.5, 82.5) remains empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) responsible for extracting assembled items is waiting for source items, indicating it is not successfully pulling items from the assembler.\n- Check inserter placement and orientation to ensure it correctly picks up items from the assembler output.\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions are valid and not blocked.\n- Ensure no inventory or belt blockage downstream of the output chest.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts\n- Previous repeated failures to place"}
