{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n\n### Furnace Setup (around x=46.0, y=-80.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (46.0, -80.0) facing UP\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Connected to transport belt from coal mining system\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Placement Issues\n- When placing furnaces, ensure exact alignment with inserter drop positions\n- Account for the 2x2 size of furnaces when calculating placement positions\n- Consider the building collision box when placing structures\n\n### Inserter Output Blockage Issues\n- Clear items blocking inserter drop positions before placing new structures\n- Ensure proper spacing between inserters and their destination entities\n- Verify transport belt placement doesn't interfere with inserter operations\n\n### Entity Alignment Issues\n- Use precise coordinate calculations for 2x2 buildings like furnaces\n- Consider using entity reference points (like inserter drop positions) for accurate placement\n- Verify final positions match intended coordinates before confirming placement\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- None defined in provided logs\n\nImportant Variables:\n- `position`: Position(x=float, y=float)\n- `direction`: Direction enum (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- `status`: EntityStatus enum (WORKING, NO_INGREDIENTS, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, NORMAL)\n- `inventory`: Dictionary of item counts\n- `warnings`: List of string error messages"}
