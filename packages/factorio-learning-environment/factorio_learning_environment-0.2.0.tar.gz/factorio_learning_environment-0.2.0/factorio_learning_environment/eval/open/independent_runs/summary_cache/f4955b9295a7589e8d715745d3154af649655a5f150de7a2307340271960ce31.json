{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (17.5, 20.5)\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions such as (3.5, 17.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity network with poles at various positions including (7.5, 8.5), (1.5, 6.5), and (20.5, 19.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to avoid warnings such as 'no input liquid' or 'no fluid present in connections'.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the boiler to prevent it from running out of fuel, which can lead to the boiler's status being 'NO_FUEL'.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement\n- Verify that entities are placed correctly and are not overlapping or causing obstruction to other entities to ensure smooth operation.\n\n### Errors in Fluid System Management\n- Monitor fluid systems to ensure they are not empty or lacking output, as indicated by statuses like 'EMPTY' or 'FULL_OUTPUT'."}
