{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units available)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (465 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning indicates a need for precise alignment.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured to supply the furnace with iron ore. Check the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they are set correctly.\n\n### Errors when Refueling with Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. This will prevent errors related to insufficient resources for refueling.\n\n### General Entity Placement and Configuration\n- Regularly check the status and warnings of entities like furnaces to ensure they are operating correctly and receiving necessary ingredients."}
