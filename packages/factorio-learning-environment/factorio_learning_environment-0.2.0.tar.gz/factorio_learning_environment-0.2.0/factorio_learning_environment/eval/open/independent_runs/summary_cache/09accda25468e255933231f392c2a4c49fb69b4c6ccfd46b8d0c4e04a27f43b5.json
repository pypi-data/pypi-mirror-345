{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generation system at x=-25.0 y=80.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at x=-21.5 y=70.5 (connected to boiler)\n- Boiler at x=-25.0 y=80.5 (connected to pump and steam engine)\n- Steam engine at x=-25.5 y=89.5 (connected to boiler)\n- Pipe network connecting all components (steam pipes now operational)\n\n### Iron mining operation at x=15.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=15.5 y=70.5 (now working)\n- Stone furnace at x=16.0 y=74.0\n- Burner inserter at x=16.5 y=72.5 (connecting drill and furnace)\n- Wooden chest at x=16.5 y=75.5 (output storage)\n\n### Copper mining operation at x=-46.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=-46.5 y=70.5 (output blocked)\n- Stone furnace at x=-46.0 y=74.0\n- Burner inserter at x=-47.5 y=72.5 (connecting drill and furnace)\n- Wooden chest at x=-45.5 y=75.5 (output storage)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Verify position is clear before placing entities (repeated chest placement attempts at occupied positions)\n- Check for obstructions when placing inserters (multiple inserter placement attempts blocked by existing entities)\n- Move closer before placing distant entities (pipe placement failed due to distance)\n\n### Power system issues\n- Add coal to boilers to generate steam (boiler still not fueled despite operational status)\n- Ensure proper pipe connections between boiler and steam engine (connection issues persist)\n\n### Production chain problems\n- Connect mining drill outputs properly (copper drill still shows \"waiting for space\" warning)\n- Verify chest positions before inventory inspection (attempt to check non-existent chest)\n- Ensure inserters have proper positioning (burner inserters placement difficulties)\n\n### Inventory management\n- Check entity existence before inventory operations (multiple attempts with missing chests)\n- Verify storage container positions before use\n\n### Distance-related errors\n- Move within placement range before attempting to build (pipe placement failed due to distance)\n- Check maximum placement distance when building remotely\n\n### Connection issues\n- Verify fluid connections are properly aligned (steam system connection problems)\n- Ensure all components in production chain are properly linked (output blocked warnings persist)"}
