{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) fueled with coal, currently blocked by an item on the ground.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) fueled with coal, waiting for source items, connected to the mining drill and transport belts.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates, currently full.\n- BeltGroup connecting entities:\n  - Transport Belt from (x=42.5, y=-82.5) to (x=44.5, y=-82.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Transport Belt from (x=43.5, y=-81.5) to (x=43.5, y=-79.5), direction DOWN.\n  - Transport Belt from (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=42.5, y=-79.5), direction LEFT.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is no obstruction or existing entity at the intended position before placing a new entity, such as a Wooden Chest or extending a transport belt.\n\n### Errors with transport belts\n- Verify that transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to ensure the flow of items between entities.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or storage space available to accept the output from entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with full output\n- Regularly check and clear the output of entities like Stone Furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
