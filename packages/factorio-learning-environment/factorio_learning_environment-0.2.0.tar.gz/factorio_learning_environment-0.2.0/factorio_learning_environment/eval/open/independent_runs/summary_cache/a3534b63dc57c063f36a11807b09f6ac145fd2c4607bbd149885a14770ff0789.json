The agent\u2019s efforts have focused on establishing a research support facility and supporting processing units, though none have finalized as an installed structure.\n\n\u2022 Lab for Research Supply at Position (0.5, 2.5)\n\u2003\u2013 Intended Use: To supply Automation Science Packs for research (Logistics Science Pack technology).\n\u2003\u2013 Details: Multiple attempts were made to locate, craft, and place a Lab here. However, errors in inventory verification and resource shortages prevented the Lab from being successfully placed.\n\n\u2022 Iron Smelting Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\n\u2003\u2013 Intended Use: To smelt iron ore into iron plates for support of lab component production.\n\u2003\u2013 Details: An alternative furnace was retrieved and used in processing operations. Although it contributed to iron plate accumulation, it remains an isolated operational facility rather than an agent\u2010constructed composite structure.\n\n\u2022 Copper Smelting Furnace at Position (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\n\u2003\u2013 Intended Use: To convert harvested copper ore into copper plates for use in copper cable production, which is a prerequisite in the Lab crafting chain.\n\u2003\u2013 Details: A copper furnace was identified and utilized for smelting, thereby boosting the available copper plate count. Its operation supports downstream production but is not part of a larger assembled structure.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage and Argument Errors\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) with get_entities(). Verify the function\u2019s signature and pass only supported parameters.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure positional arguments match the API\u2019s expectations to prevent errors regarding argument count.\n\n\u2022 Handling Non\u2010Iterable Returns\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that API calls (such as get_entities()) return an iterable object. When a None value is possible, incorporate a fallback (for example, converting it to an empty list) before performing any iteration.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the necessary Lab item exists in the inventory before attempting placement to avoid \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d errors.\n\u2003\u2013 Prior to crafting, ensure that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available. Verify that the complete production chain is in place, including the ability to produce precursors (iron plates, copper plates) using available processing facilities."}
