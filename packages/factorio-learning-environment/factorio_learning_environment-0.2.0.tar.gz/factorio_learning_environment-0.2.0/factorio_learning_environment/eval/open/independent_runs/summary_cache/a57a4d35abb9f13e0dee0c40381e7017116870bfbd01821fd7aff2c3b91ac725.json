{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in an empty map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, ore inserters, plate inserters, and output chests have failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors with movement commands\n- Correctly index position objects. Errors such as \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" indicate incorrect handling of position data. Ensure that position data is accessed using integer indices.\n- Ensure that position objects are used correctly. Errors like \"'Position' object is not callable\" suggest misuse of position objects. Verify that position objects are being used as intended in the code.\n\n### Errors with building area setup\n- Adjust the size of the BuildingBox or use multiple smaller BuildingBoxes when placing entities. The error \"No viable place to put Prototype.WoodenChest near the centre position\" suggests that the current BuildingBox size is too large or improperly configured for the available space."}
