{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created during these execution steps. Multiple attempts were made to place a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5), but failures due to insufficient inventory and unmet crafting prerequisites prevented a Lab from appearing on the map. Although existing furnaces (e.g. one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were referenced for smelting operations, none of these were constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API parameter errors for get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments such as \u201cradius.\u201d\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the proper number and type of arguments are provided according to the API specification.\n\u2003\u2013 When the function may return None, use a fallback (e.g. an empty list) before iterating.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement and crafting issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that a Lab item exists in inventory before attempting to place it.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable, and copper-plate) are available and that the necessary smelting or crafting facilities are in place.\n\u2003\u2013 Review the production chain and resource availability so that cascading shortages do not block lab crafting.\n\n\u2022 General resource management:\n\u2003\u2013 Before triggering smelting or crafting operations, ensure that sufficient raw materials (iron-ore, copper-ore, coal, etc.) are available to support the required production processes."}
