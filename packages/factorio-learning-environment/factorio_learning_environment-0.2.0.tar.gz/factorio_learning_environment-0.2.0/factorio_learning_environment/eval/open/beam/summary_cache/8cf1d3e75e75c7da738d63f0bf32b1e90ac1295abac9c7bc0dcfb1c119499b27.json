Monitor both furnaces as they continue processing their respective iron ore.\n2. Once the second furnace finishes, we can gather more iron ore to ensure continuous production.\n\nLet\u2019s wait briefly to see how many more iron plates are produced by both furnaces after a short period.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the furnaces to process their iron ore\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration if needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-118]"}
