{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nComplex automated coal mining and transport system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Storage chest system:\n  - Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) containing 1600 coal\n  - Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) containing ~740 coal as buffer\n- Transport system:\n  - Chest inserter (x=42.5, y=-80.5) moving coal from wooden chest to belt\n  - Transport belt (x=43.5, y=-80.5) moving RIGHT\n  - Furnace inserter (x=43.5, y=-81.5) for furnace fuel input\n- Stone furnaces:\n  - Primary furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n  - Secondary furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage (x=49.5, y=-80.5)\n- Wooden chest containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Belt Network\n- Main belt group running from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5 at x=42.5\n- Additional belt at x=43.5, y=-80.5 moving RIGHT\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Verify target location is clear before placing entities\n- Check for existing objects that might block placement of new entities\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities, especially around furnaces and belts\n\n### Transport System Issues\n- Transport belt blockage causing upstream backups - need to ensure belts can flow freely\n- Monitor inserter drop positions to prevent conflicts with other entities\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended transport flow\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices\n- Ensure proper item flow between connected components\n- Watch for \"full\" warnings in chests and manage inventory levels\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill\n- `coal_chest`: Chest\n- `belt_right`: TransportBelt\n- `furnace`: Furnace\n\n### System States\n- `EntityStatus.WORKING`: Operating normally\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION`: Buffer full\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`: Input empty\n- `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`: Missing materials\n- `EntityStatus.NORMAL`: Default operational state"}
