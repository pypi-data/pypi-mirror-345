{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the boiler to the steam engine with pipes at various positions, including (-5.5, 16.5) to (-2.5, 22.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler with pipes at various positions, including (-8.5, 23.5) to (-4.5, 24.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variable Errors\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, `steam_engine_buildable_area` was not defined when attempting to use it.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that all operands are of compatible types. For instance, adding an integer to a `ModelPrivateAttr` is unsupported.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items. Iron plates and iron gear wheels need to be crafted or smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Ensure that the required item is present in the inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, a steam engine could not be placed because it was not in the inventory.\n\n### Connection Errors Due to Missing Items\n- Before attempting to connect entities with pipes or other items, ensure that the necessary items are in the inventory. Lack of pipes prevented connecting a boiler to a steam engine.\n\n### Insertion Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, coal could not be inserted into a boiler due to a lack of coal in the inventory."}
