{"content": "The error message indicates that the `connect_entities` function is attempting to connect entities using pipes, which is not applicable in this context since we're dealing with electrical connections. This suggests a misunderstanding or misconfiguration in the function's implementation or parameters.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Correct Electrical Connection**:\n   - Ensure that the `connect_entities` function is used correctly for electrical connections. It seems like the function might be misconfigured or misused here. Verify that the function is meant for connecting electrical entities.\n\n2. **Check Inventory for Electrical Components**:\n   - Ensure that you have sufficient small electric poles in your inventory to make the necessary connections. The error message about pipes is misleading in this context, but it indicates a lack of required resources.\n\n3. **Manual Connection**:\n   - If the function is not working as expected, consider manually placing additional electric poles to bridge the gap between the existing pole and the assembling machine.\n\n4. **Verify Positions**:\n   - Double-check the positions of the electric pole and the assembling machine to ensure they are within a reasonable range for connection.\n\n### Example Code:\n\n```python\n# Ensure you have enough small electric poles in inventory\nrequired_poles = 2  # Adjust based on the distance and connection needs\ncurrent_poles = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, 0)\n\nif current_poles < required_poles:\n    print(f\"Not enough small electric poles. Required: {required_poles}, Available: {current_poles}\")\nelse:\n    # Attempt to place additional poles to connect the assembling machine\n    try:\n        # Place a pole closer to the assembling machine if needed\n        new_pole_position = Position(3.5, -0.5)  # Adjust based on map layout\n        place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=new_pole_position, direction=Direction.UP)\n        print(\"Placed additional electric pole.\")\n\n        # Connect the new pole to the existing pole and the assembling machine\n        connect_entities(new_pole_position, small_pole_position)\n        connect_entities(new_pole_position, assembling_machine_position)\n        print(\"Connected poles to the assembling machine.\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error during manual connection: {str(e)}\")\n\n# Final state check\nfinal_inventory_state = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final Inventory Status: {final_inventory_state}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the Map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis code attempts to manually place and connect additional electric poles to ensure the assembling machine receives power. Adjust the positions based on your map layout and ensure you have enough resources to place the poles.", "summary_range": "[1-102]"}
