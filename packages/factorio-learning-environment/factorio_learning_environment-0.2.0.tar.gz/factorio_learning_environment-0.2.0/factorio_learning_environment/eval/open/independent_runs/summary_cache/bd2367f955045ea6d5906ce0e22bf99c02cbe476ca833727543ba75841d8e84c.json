{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. All placement attempts have failed, resulting in no entities currently existing on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target position is valid and unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. All placement attempts for Wooden Chests, Iron Chests, Transport Belts, Burner Inserters, and Stone Furnaces failed, indicating potential issues with occupied or invalid tiles.\n\n### Errors due to string index usage\n- Correctly handle data types in code to avoid errors like \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\". This suggests an issue with how strings are being indexed or accessed in the code.\n\n### Errors related to global constraints\n- Investigate any global constraints or map settings that may be affecting placement. Multiple logs indicate potential global constraints or hidden constraints preventing successful placement.\n\n### Errors when diagnosing buildable areas\n- Even when buildable areas are identified, ensure that there are no hidden constraints or errors that prevent placement within these areas."}
