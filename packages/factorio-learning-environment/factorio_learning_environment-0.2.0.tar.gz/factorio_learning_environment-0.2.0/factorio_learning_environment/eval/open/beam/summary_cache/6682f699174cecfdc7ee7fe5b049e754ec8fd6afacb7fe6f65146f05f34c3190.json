{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe extraction process has successfully removed the blocking stone from the active furnace:\n\n### New Active Furnace Status:\n- The furnace now contains **1 piece of stone-brick**, indicating that the previous stone has been cleared.\n- Its status is still **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"**, confirming it is ready to accept new materials.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - **1 piece of stone-brick** in the furnace.\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the new one).\n  - **13 pieces of coal** available.\n  - **1 piece of stone** still in inventory.\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is now free of blocking materials and is prepared for new inputs.\n- However, I currently only have **1 piece of stone**, which is insufficient to meet the requirement of **5 pieces of stone** necessary for smelting.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Gather Additional Stone**: I need to locate and harvest **4 more pieces of stone** to meet the furnace's requirement.\n2. **Reload the Furnace**: Once I collect the required stone, I will insert both the stone and Copper Ore back into the furnace for processing.\n3. **Check Processing Activation**: Finally, I will verify if the furnace begins its smelting operation once the materials are loaded.\n\nLet's proceed to find and gather the required additional stone resources. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Find the nearest stone resource patch for gathering additional stone\nstone_resource_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\n\n# Move to collect more stone resources\nmove_to(stone_resource_position)  # Navigate to the nearest Stone resource location \n\n# Harvest the 4 additional pieces of stone needed\nharvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), quantity=4)  # Attempting to gather 4 more pieces of stone \n\n# Check the overall inventory again after harvesting to confirm collected stone\noverall_inventory_after_harvesting_additional_stone = inspect_inventory()  # Check overall inventory after harvest.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after harvesting additional stone: {overall_inventory_after_harvesting_additional_stone}\")  # Confirm total inventory after harvesting stone.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-468]"}
