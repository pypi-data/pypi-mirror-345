{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal and processing copper ore\n- Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal and processing copper ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) fueled with coal but currently lacking ingredients to smelt\n\n### Fluid and Electricity Infrastructure\n- PipeGroup at position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) with fluid system 1414, currently empty\n- PipeGroup at position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) with fluid system 1415, full output with water\n- PipeGroup at position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) with fluid system 1417, full output with water\n- ElectricityGroup with poles distributed across various positions, providing a voltage of 66\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items not present in inventory\n- Ensure that the items you wish to insert into a structure are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them. This will prevent errors like \"No copper-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors related to fuel and ingredient management\n- Regularly check and manage the fuel and ingredients for your furnaces to ensure continuous production. Lack of fuel or ingredients can halt production processes."}
