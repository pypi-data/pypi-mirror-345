{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n- Ensure to start building basic structures such as electricity generators and mining setups to progress in the game.\n- Consider placing mining drills and furnaces to start processing resources like iron ore and coal.\n- Remember to position yourself close to entities when interacting with them to avoid errors related to distance.\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place structures. For example, ensure you have a stone furnace available before trying to place it.\n- Gather raw resources such as stone directly from the environment, as they cannot be crafted. Ensure you have enough raw materials before attempting to craft items that require them.\n- To avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning in furnaces, ensure that both fuel and smeltable items are present in the furnace. Check inventory levels and supply the furnace with the required resources to maintain continuous operation.\n- Regularly monitor the furnace's status to ensure it is operating efficiently. Address any warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" by supplying necessary resources promptly."}
