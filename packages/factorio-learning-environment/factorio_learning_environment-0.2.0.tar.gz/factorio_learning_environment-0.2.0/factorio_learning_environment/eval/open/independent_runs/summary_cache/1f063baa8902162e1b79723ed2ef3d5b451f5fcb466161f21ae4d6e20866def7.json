{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is currently working but has warnings about the chest at the drop position being full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains 187 units of iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). The furnace at (-15.0, -48.0) is working with a source inventory of iron ore and a result inventory of iron plates. The furnace at (-13.0, -48.0) has no ingredients to smelt and its result inventory is full. The furnace at (-11.0, -48.0) also has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel in Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure to maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel the burner mining drill to avoid interruptions in mining operations.\n\n### Full Chest at Drop Position\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Continuously supply iron ore to the furnaces to prevent them from running out of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Full Furnace Result Inventory\n- Regularly extract iron plates from the furnaces to prevent the result inventory from becoming full and halting further production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n- `coal`: int = 5\n- `iron-plate`: int = 1765\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int = 4\n\nNo utility functions were invoked, and no additional information on failure or success modes is available."}
