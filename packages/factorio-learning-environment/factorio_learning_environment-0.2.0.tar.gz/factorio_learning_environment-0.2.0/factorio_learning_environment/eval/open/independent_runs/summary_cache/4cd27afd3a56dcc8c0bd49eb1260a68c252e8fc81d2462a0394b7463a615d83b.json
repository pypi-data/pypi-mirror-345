{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, with a warning to empty the chest at (40.5, -83.5) to continue mining.\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal and processing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from the stone furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belt and Burner Inserter setup facilitating movement of items.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) processing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring items from the stone furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, 0.5) for storing copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities for efficient item transportation, including belts from (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5) and from (40.5, -83.5) to (38.5, -83.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or empty entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract. This error occurred when trying to extract coal from a wooden chest at (40.5, -83.5) which did not contain coal.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items to avoid them idling. This was observed with inserters at positions (1.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5), and (11.5, 0.5).\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining drills and inserters from halting operations due to full storage. This was noted with the chest at (40.5, -83.5) connected to the mining drill."}
