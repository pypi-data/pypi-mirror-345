The current chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, which halts the mining process.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] = {'wooden-chest': 3, 'coal': 35, 'iron-ore': 47, 'iron-plate': 6634, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}"}
