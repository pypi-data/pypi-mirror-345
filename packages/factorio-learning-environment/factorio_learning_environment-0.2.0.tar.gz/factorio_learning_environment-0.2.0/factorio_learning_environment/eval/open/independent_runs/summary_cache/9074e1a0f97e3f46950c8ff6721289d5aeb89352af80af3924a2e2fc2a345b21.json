{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine with various pipes at positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and others.\n- Electricity Group with small electric poles at positions including (7.5, -60.5), (7.5, -59.5), (8.5, -60.5), (-0.5, 26.5), (0.5, 26.5), and (30.5, -34.5).\n\n### Smelting Setup at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connecting the stone furnace and the wooden chests.\n\n### Research Lab Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently with no research in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Research Setup\n- Ensure that the research technology is correctly specified and available before attempting to set it. The error in setting research to Technology.Automation indicates a possible typo or unavailability of the specified technology.\n- Check the initial research state and ensure it is not empty before accessing elements. The IndexError suggests accessing an element in an empty list, which can be avoided by verifying the list's contents before operations.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
