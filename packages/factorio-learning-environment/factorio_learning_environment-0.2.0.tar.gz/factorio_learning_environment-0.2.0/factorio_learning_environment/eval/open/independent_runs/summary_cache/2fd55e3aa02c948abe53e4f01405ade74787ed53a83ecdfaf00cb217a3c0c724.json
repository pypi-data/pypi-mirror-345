Move closer to the target position.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Always check your inventory for the required items (e.g., wooden chest) before attempting to place an entity.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from empty or inaccessible chests\n- Verify that the chest has the required items and is accessible before attempting extraction. Ensure the inserter is correctly rotated to face the chest.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Use coal or other fuel sources.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) and fuel to operate.\n\n#### Errors when chests at drop positions are full\n- Empty chests at drop positions regularly to allow mining drills to continue operation."}
