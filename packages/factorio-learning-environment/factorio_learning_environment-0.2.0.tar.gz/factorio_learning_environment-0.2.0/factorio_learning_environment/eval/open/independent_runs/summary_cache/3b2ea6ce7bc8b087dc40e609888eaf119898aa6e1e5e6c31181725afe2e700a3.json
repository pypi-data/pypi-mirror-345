{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0)**: Fueled with coal, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0)**: Fueled with coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)**: Fueled with coal, extracting resources and transferring them to nearby chests.\n- **Burner Inserters**: Positioned at (-13.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-8.5, -47.5), these inserters are responsible for transferring materials between chests and furnaces.\n- **Chests**: Positioned at (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), and (-7.5, -47.5), used for storing and transferring iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Resource Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Chests**: Positioned at various locations, including (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), and (-7.5, -47.5), used for storing resources like iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**: Positioned at (-13.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-8.5, -47.5), facilitating the transfer of resources between chests and production entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items into Full Inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has sufficient space before attempting to insert items. Regularly monitor and manage inventory levels to prevent overflow.\n\n### Errors When Inserters Are Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities have available items for the inserters to transfer. Keep the production line supplied with necessary resources to avoid idle inserters.\n\n### Errors When Furnaces Have No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are continuously supplied with the necessary raw materials for smelting. Regularly check and replenish the input inventory of furnaces to maintain production."}
