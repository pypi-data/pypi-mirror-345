{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving ore from the drill to the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (14.5, 73.5) extracting iron plates from the furnace onto transport belts\n- Transport belts connecting furnace output inserter at (13.5, 73.5) to assembler input inserter at (24.5, 73.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembler\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembler\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels\n- Small electric poles at positions (21.5, 75.5), (18.5, 71.5), and (14.5, 71.5) connected to power the inserters and assembler\n\nThis structure forms a compact iron gear wheel factory integrating mining, smelting, assembling, and item collection.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to placing entities where space is occupied\n- Several attempts to place burner inserters next to the furnace failed because the target tile was occupied by either a wooden chest or another inserter. To avoid this, always check for existing entities at the intended placement position and increase spacing or change direction accordingly.\n- Attempt to place a small electric pole at (14.5, 75.5) failed due to an existing object blocking placement. Verify tile availability before placing poles.\n\n### Errors from missing inventory items when placing entities\n- Tried to place assembling-machine-1 but failed because it was not present in inventory. Ensure the correct entity type is available in inventory before placement commands.\n\n### Errors connecting transport belts directly from furnaces\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a furnace entity. Instead, use an inserter to extract items from the furnace and connect belts from the inserter\u2019s output position.\n\n### Power connectivity and assembler energy issues\n- The assembling machine 2 was reported as having no power despite electric poles nearby. This indicates incomplete or incorrect power pole connections. Confirm that all electric poles are properly connected in an electricity network and that the assembler is within the coverage area.\n- Insert coal fuel into burner inserters and burner mining drills regularly to prevent \"out of fuel\" warnings and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Inserter fuel management and status warnings\n- Inserters feeding furnaces and assemblers showed \"out of fuel\" warnings causing them to wait for source items. Regularly insert coal into burner inserters to maintain their operation.\n\nOverall, careful spatial planning for entity placement, verifying inventory before placing entities, proper use of inserters for item transfer from furnaces, and ensuring robust power pole connections will mitigate the encountered errors and improve factory throughput."}
