{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and another at position (-18.0, -70.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of transport belts and a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) and another at position (-12.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between chests and belts.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring items from a Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) to the chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions (e.g., (-20.5, -63.5), (-13.5, -61.5), (-14.5, -54.5), (-12.5, -54.5)) for storing various resources like iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup connecting various points such as (x=-25.5, y=-70.5) to (x=-23.5, y=-70.5) and others, facilitating the movement of resources between different parts of the factory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connectivity\n- Ensure that transport belts are placed without gaps to maintain connectivity. Check for gaps at positions like (-21.5, -65.5) and (-20.5, -65.5) to ensure smooth operation.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items to prevent them from idling. Check the connection between inserters and source entities to ensure efficient item transfer.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply lines to furnaces at positions like (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0) to maintain production efficiency."}
