{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup for water transport, starting at position (x=-3.5, y=26.5)\n- PipeGroup for steam transport, starting at position (x=1.5, y=26.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles connecting from the lab at position (x=5.5, y=5.5) to the power source at position (x=10.5, y=34.5), including poles at positions such as (x=7.5, y=9.5), (x=13.5, y=27.5), and others.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- BeltGroup for coal transport, including belts at positions such as (x=50.5, y=-86.5) and (x=43.5, y=-84.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n\n### Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation-science-pack at position (x=5.5, y=5.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### No Electricity Group Found\n- Ensure that all electricity poles are properly connected and that there is a continuous path from the power source to the lab or other powered entities.\n\n### No Pipe Group Found\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected to form a continuous path for fluid transport. Ensure that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Refueling and Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers and burner mining drills to ensure continuous operation.\n- Monitor and manage inventory levels in chests to prevent overflow or shortages that may halt production processes."}
