{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace cluster at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (4.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, 0.0)\n\nThese furnaces are used for smelting ores into plates and other materials. Currently, they are not processing any items due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (8.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (8.5, 0.5)\n\nThis chest is used for storing items, including iron plates. It currently contains a significant amount of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting into furnaces\n- Inventory full errors indicate that you cannot insert items into the furnace because the furnace's inventory is full. Make sure to check the furnace's inventory capacity before inserting items.\n- Ensure that you are inserting the correct quantity of items that the furnace can accept without exceeding its inventory limit. This error has occurred multiple times at the first, second, third, and fourth furnaces.\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure you have enough required sub-ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft items. If a required ingredient is not available, the crafting will fail. This error has occurred multiple times when trying to craft iron gear wheels due to insufficient iron plates.\n\n### General inventory management\n- Regularly monitor your inventory to avoid reaching capacity limits, which can prevent you from inserting items into machines or crafting new items."}
