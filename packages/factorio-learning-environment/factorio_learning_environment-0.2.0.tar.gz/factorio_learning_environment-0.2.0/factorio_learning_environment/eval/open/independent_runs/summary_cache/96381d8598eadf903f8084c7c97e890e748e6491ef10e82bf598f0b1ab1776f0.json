{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5), boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5), steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5), and connecting pipes. The system is experiencing connection issues between the boiler and steam engine, with multiple failed attempts to connect them. The boiler is now fueled with 50 coal and is working, but the steam engine remains disconnected from the power network. Small electric poles have been placed at positions (x=0.5, y=9.5), (x=0.5, y=50.5), and (x=0.5, y=99.5) to create a power line from the steam engine to the factory area.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting at position(19.5, 74.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=19.5, y=74.5) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace (position x=20.0, y=78.0) for smelting iron plates\n- Inserter (position x=19.5, y=76.5) that moves ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter (position x=21.5, y=78.5) that takes iron plates from furnace\n- Small electric pole (position x=21.5, y=76.5) for power\n- Transport belt (position x=22.5, y=78.5) for moving iron plates\nAll components currently have no power and are not operating.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting at position(-49.5, 81.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5, y=81.5) extracting copper ore\n- Stone furnace (position x=-49.0, y=85.0) for smelting copper plates\n- Inserter (position x=-49.5, y=83.5) that moves ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter (position x=-47.5, y=85.5) that takes copper plates from furnace\n- Small electric pole (position x=-47.5, y=83.5) for power\nAll components currently have no power and are not operating.\n\n### Coal Mining at position(22.0, 18.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=22.0, y=18.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden chest (position x=22.5, y=19.5) for collecting coal, currently contains 176 coal\nThe drill is currently out of fuel and not operating.\n\n### Temporary Smelting Area at position(0.0, 140.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Temporary iron furnace (position x=0.0, y=140.0) with 40 iron plates in output\n- Temporary copper furnace (position x=10.0, y=140.0) with 40 copper plates in output\n- Both furnaces have coal fuel (16 each) but are not smelting due to lack of ingredients\n\n### Gear Production at position(-9.5, 100.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=-9.5, y=100.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Input inserter (position x=-9.5, y=98.5) for iron plates\n- Output inserter (position x=-9.5, y=102.5) for finished gears\n- Small electric poles (positions x=-11.5, y=98.5 and x=-7.5, y=102.5) for power\nAll components currently have no power and are not operating.\n\n### Science Pack Production at position(-4.5, 115.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=-4.5, y=115.5) set to craft automation science packs\n- Gear input inserter (position x=-4.5, y=113.5)\n- Copper plate input inserter (position x=-6.5, y=115.5)\n- Science pack output inserter (position x=-2.5, y=115.5)\n- Output wooden chest (position x=-1.5, y=115.5)\n- Small electric pole (position x"}
