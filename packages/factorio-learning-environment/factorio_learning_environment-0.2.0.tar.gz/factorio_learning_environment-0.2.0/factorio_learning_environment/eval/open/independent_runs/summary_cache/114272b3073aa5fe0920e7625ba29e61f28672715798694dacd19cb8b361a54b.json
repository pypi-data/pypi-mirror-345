{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-13.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-13.5, 23.5) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) (Status: WORKING)\n- Multiple Pipe Groups connecting various positions, including:\n  - Pipe at position (-8.5, 23.5) (Status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n  - Pipe Groups at positions (-5.5, 16.5), (-11.5, 19.5), (-10.5, 22.5), (-10.5, 23.5), (-6.5, 21.5), (-5.5, 20.5), (-6.5, 23.5), (-11.5, 24.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-4.5, 24.5) (Status: EMPTY)\n- Electricity Group at position (-3.67, 20.21) (Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) (Status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object at the target location before placing a pipe. Clear any existing pipes or objects if necessary.\n- Verify that the target location is suitable for placing pipes, avoiding overlaps with water or other entities.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Confirm that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected to form a continuous path. Check for any gaps or misalignments between pipes.\n- Ensure that the correct type of pipe is being used for connections, such as regular pipes or underground pipes, depending on the situation.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Maintain an adequate supply of pipes in the inventory to avoid placement failures due to lack of items.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- When crafting items, ensure that all required ingredients are available in the inventory. For example, iron plates must be smelted in a furnace before being used to craft pipes.\n\n### Electricity Connection Errors\n- Ensure that all electricity-related entities, such as the steam engine and electricity group, are properly connected to the electric network to function correctly."}
