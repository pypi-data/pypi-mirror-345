{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Wooden chest for coal storage (position x=23.5, y=-16.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Wooden chest for iron ore storage (position x=-14.5, y=21.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Line\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces (positions x=-11.0, y=20.0 and x=-9.0, y=20.0)\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill for copper ore (position x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Storage chest for copper ore (position x=20.5, y=21.5)\n- Stone furnace for smelting (position x=24.0, y=20.0)\n- Output chest for copper plates (position x=24.5, y=17.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for automation:\n  - Inserter moving ore from drill to chest (position x=19.5, y=21.5)\n  - Inserter at position (x=21.5, y=21.5)\n  - Inserter feeding furnace (position x=22.5, y=20.5)\n  - Inserter moving finished plates (position x=24.5, y=18.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests - use inserters instead\n- When creating belt connections, ensure the path is clear and valid\n- Belt placement requires exact positioning - verify coordinates are valid before placing\n\n### Entity connection errors\n- When connecting entities with transport belts, ensure:\n  - The path between entities is clear and unobstructed\n  - The connection points are compatible with belt placement\n  - The positions for belt placement are on valid tiles\n- Use inserters instead of belts when moving items to/from containers"}
