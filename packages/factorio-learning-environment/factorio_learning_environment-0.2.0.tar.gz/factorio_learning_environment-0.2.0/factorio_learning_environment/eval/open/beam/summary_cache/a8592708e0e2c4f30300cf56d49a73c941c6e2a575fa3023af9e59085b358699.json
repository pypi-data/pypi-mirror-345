Continue monitoring both furnaces as they process their remaining iron ore.\n2. Once the furnaces finish processing, we should gather more iron ore to keep production steady.\n3. Consider crafting additional entities or expanding our factory layout based on the current production levels.\n\nLet's wait a bit longer to see how many more iron plates are produced before we gather more resources.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the furnaces to process their remaining iron ore\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration as needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for further production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-76]"}
