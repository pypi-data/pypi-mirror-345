Regularly check the fuel levels and insert coal as needed.\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- The burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) is frequently waiting for source items. Ensure that there are items available in the source (wooden chest) for the inserter to pick up.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure that there is space available in the destination for the burner inserter to place items. If the destination is full, the inserter will wait indefinitely.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int (total coal available in wooden chest)\n- `wood`: int (current inventory of wood)"}
