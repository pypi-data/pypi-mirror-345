{"content": "The repeated error message indicates that the `random` module is not being recognized, despite the import statement. This suggests there might be an issue with the environment setup or the script execution context. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Import Statement is Correct and at the Top:**\n   Make sure the import statement for `random` is at the very top of your script, before any function definitions or other code. This ensures that the module is available throughout the script.\n\n   ```python\n   import random\n   ```\n\n2. **Check the Execution Environment:**\n   Verify that the script is being executed in a standard Python environment where the `random` module is available. If you're using a custom or restricted environment, ensure that it supports standard Python libraries.\n\n3. **Avoid Name Conflicts:**\n   Make sure there are no variables or functions named `random` in your script that might be overshadowing the module import. This can happen if you accidentally redefine `random` elsewhere in your code.\n\n4. **Test in a Simple Script:**\n   Create a simple script to test if the `random` module is working correctly:\n\n   ```python\n   import random\n\n   print(random.uniform(-10, 10))\n   ```\n\n   Run this script independently to ensure that the `random` module is functioning as expected.\n\n5. **Check for Syntax or Indentation Errors:**\n   Ensure there are no syntax or indentation errors in your script that might prevent the import statement from being executed properly.\n\n6. **Restart the Environment:**\n   Sometimes, restarting the execution environment or interpreter can resolve issues related to module imports.\n\nIf you've verified all these steps and the issue persists, it might be helpful to provide more context about the environment or platform where the script is being executed, as there could be specific restrictions or configurations affecting the import.", "summary_range": "[1-350]"}
