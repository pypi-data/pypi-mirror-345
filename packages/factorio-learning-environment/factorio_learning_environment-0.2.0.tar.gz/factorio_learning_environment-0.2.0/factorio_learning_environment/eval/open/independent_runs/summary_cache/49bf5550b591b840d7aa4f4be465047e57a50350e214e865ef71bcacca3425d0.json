{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis facility extracts iron ore using the burner mining drill, stores it in the wooden chest, and then transfers it to the stone furnace for smelting into iron plates using the burner inserter.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis facility extracts coal using the burner mining drill, stores it in the wooden chest, and then transfers it to the stone furnace for smelting processes using the burner inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to insufficient items for insertion.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage. This will ensure continuous operation of mining facilities."}
