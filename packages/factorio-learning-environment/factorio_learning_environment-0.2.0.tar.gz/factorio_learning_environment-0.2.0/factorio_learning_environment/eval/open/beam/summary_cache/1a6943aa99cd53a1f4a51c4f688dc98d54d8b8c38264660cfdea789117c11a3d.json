{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Contains iron ore\n  - Produces iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Drops mined resources to position (-15.5, -51.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5)\n  - Collects mined iron ore from the burner mining drill\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required raw materials are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, stone must be gathered before crafting a stone furnace, and wood must be gathered before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Entities\n- Verify that the target entity contains the item you wish to extract before attempting extraction. For instance, ensure that the furnace contains iron plates before trying to extract them.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Confirm that the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, ensure a wooden chest is crafted and available before placing it.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined correctly. For instance, ensure that 'extracted_iron_plates' is defined before using it in conditional statements.\n\n### Errors Due to Incorrect Crafting Processes\n- Remember that certain items, like iron plates, require specific crafting processes, such as smelting in a furnace, rather than direct crafting."}
