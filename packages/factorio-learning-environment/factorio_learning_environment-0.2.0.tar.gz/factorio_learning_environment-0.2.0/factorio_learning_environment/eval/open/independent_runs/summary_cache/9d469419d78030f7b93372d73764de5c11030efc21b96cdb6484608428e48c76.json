{"content": "Here's the report based on the execution logs:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Station at (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace used for smelting iron plates. Currently has no ingredients but contains 16 iron plates in output.\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Transport belt at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5)\nThe structure is set up to mine coal and transport it via belt. Mining drill is operational with 8 coal as fuel.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check if a tile is occupied before placing entities. Several attempts were made to place furnaces and transport belts on occupied tiles\n- Remove existing entities if you need to place something in their location\n\n### Resource Requirements\n- Ensure all required raw materials are gathered before attempting to craft items\n- For crafting burner-mining-drill: Need iron plates which require smelting, not direct crafting\n- For crafting burner-inserter: Need iron gear wheels which require iron plates\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Verify sufficient materials in inventory before attempting insertions\n- Multiple attempts were made to insert coal when inventory was empty\n\n### Belt Connection Issues\n- Ensure proper spacing and alignment when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Failed attempts to connect inserters to belts due to invalid positioning\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables:\n- iron_pos: Position (coordinates for iron ore mining)\n- furnace: Entity (stone furnace reference)\n- belts: List[Entity] (transport belt collection)\n- inserter: Entity (burner inserter reference)\n\n### Notable Entity States:\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Indicates output is blocked\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Indicates input is empty\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Entity is functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Entity lacks required input materials"}
