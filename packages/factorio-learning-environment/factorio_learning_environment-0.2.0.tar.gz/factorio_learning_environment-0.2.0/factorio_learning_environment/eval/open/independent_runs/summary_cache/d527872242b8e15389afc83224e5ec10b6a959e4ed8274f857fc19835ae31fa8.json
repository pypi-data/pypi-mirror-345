{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5), currently working and fueled by coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) serving as a storage unit for iron ore, currently holding 11 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the transport belt, currently waiting for source items.\n- **Transport Belt** starting from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) and continuing to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), facilitating the movement of iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients and full result inventory.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) transferring items from the transport belt to the stone furnace, currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory in Chest\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to prevent mining stoppages due to full inventory.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure the stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) has the necessary ingredients to smelt and that its output is not full to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Belt and Inserter Blockages\n- Regularly check and clear any blockages in the belt and inserter system to ensure smooth operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **Inventory**: A dictionary containing the current inventory status with items such as 'wood', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n- **Belt Status**: A data structure representing the status and configuration of the belt system, including inputs, outputs, and inventory status."}
