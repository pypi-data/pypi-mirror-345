{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Transfer and Storage System\n- Consists of the following entities:\n  - Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing 742 units of coal.\n  - Wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5) containing 304 units of coal.\n  - Burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal between chests.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System\n- Consists of the following entities:\n  - Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with 14 units of coal as fuel, actively mining coal.\n  - Burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) facilitating coal transfer from the mining drill to the storage chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production System\n- Consists of the following entities:\n  - Stone furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with 5 units of coal as fuel, currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n  - Stone furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with 13 units of coal as fuel, currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n  - Wooden chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) each containing 5 units of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply chain to ensure raw materials are available and being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the quantity of coal in various chests.\n  - `furnace_status`: Dict[str, str] - Monitors the operational status of furnaces, including any warnings or errors."}
