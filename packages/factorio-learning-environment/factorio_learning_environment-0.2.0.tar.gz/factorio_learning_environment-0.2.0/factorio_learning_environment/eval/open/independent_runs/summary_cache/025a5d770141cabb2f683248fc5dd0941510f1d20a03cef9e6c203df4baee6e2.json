{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0) and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel and the offshore pump is working.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Lab at position(2.5, 1.5)\nConsists of a lab (position 2.5, 1.5) that is currently not connected to a power network.\n\n### Small electric poles\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position -1.5, -11.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -0.5, -11.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -11.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -10.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -2.5, -9.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -2.5, -8.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -9.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -0.5, -7.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -1.5, -7.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -7.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 0.5, -7.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients for crafting are available in your inventory before attempting to craft items. In this case, wood is required for crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are correctly referenced. The error indicates that the 'Position' object does not have the attribute 'position', which suggests a possible misuse of the API or incorrect referencing of entity positions. Ensure you are using the correct properties when connecting entities."}
