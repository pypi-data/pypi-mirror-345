{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Stone furnace at (48.0, -79.0) facing UP\n\nThe system appears to be a coal mining and processing setup where:\n- Mining drill extracts coal and outputs to chest\n- First inserter moves coal from chest to transport belt\n- Second inserter takes from belt to furnace\n- Transport belt connects the components\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Placement and Alignment Issues\n- Multiple attempts to place furnace at correct position show issues with alignment\n- Ensure furnace placement coordinates match exactly with inserter drop position\n- Verify entity neighbor relationships before placing connected structures\n\n### Blocked Output Issues\n- Transport belt getting blocked at (43.5, -80.5)\n- Items blocking ground preventing inserter operation\n- Ensure there is a proper output sink entity to accept products\n- Clear blocked belts before continuing operations\n\n### Entity Direction Issues\n- Inserter direction changes needed multiple times\n- Verify correct facing direction of all entities during initial placement\n- Consider entity input/output positions when determining direction\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to() - Places entity adjacent to reference entity\n- rebuild_furnace() - Reconstructs furnace with proper alignment\n- clear_blocked_belt() - Removes items blocking transport belt\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_position: Position(x=float, y=float)\n- inserter_pickup: Position(x=float, y=float) \n- inserter_drop: Position(x=float, y=float)\n- entity_direction: Direction enum (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)"}
