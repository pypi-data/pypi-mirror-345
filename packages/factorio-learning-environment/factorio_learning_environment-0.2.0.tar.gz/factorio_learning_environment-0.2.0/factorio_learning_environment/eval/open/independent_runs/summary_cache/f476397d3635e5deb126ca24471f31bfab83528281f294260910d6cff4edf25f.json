{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Chest (wooden-chest) with an inventory containing 25 coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (burner-mining-drill) that is currently working and has coal as fuel. It has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5) and is connected to the wooden chest.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) that is currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt. It has an inventory containing 9 coal and is receiving iron ore.\n\n### Copper Plate Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (-15.0, -50.0) that is connected to the wooden chest and is expected to process iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace without ingredients**\n  - Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt before inserting items. Check the inventory of the furnace to confirm the presence of required materials.\n\n- **Errors when the mining drill's drop position chest is full**\n  - Regularly check the inventory of the wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) to ensure it is not full. Empty the chest to allow the mining drill to continue operating.\n\n- **Errors when extracting from the wooden chest**\n  - Ensure that the wooden chest has enough coal before attempting to extract. Monitor the inventory of the chest to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `extract_from_chest(chest_position: Tuple[float, float], item: str, quantity: int) -> None`\n    - **Success Mode:** Successfully extracts the specified quantity of the item from the chest.\n    - **Failure Mode:** Fails if the chest does not contain enough of the item.\n  \n  - `insert_into_furnace(furnace_position: Tuple[float, float], item: str, quantity: int) -> None`\n    - **Success Mode:** Successfully inserts the specified quantity of the item into the furnace.\n    - **Failure Mode:** Fails if the furnace has no space or no ingredients to process.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `wood: int` - 6\n  - `coal: int` - 1670\n  - `iron_ore: int` - 79\n  - `iron_plate: int` - 457"}
