{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo permanent structures have been successfully established on the map. Multiple attempts were made to create and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded because a Lab item was never available in the inventory. Although existing furnaces (an iron furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were retrieved for smelting operations, they are part of the pre\u2010existing environment and were not newly created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect get_entities usage\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, remove unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. do not use \u201cradius\u201d) and ensure the number and type of arguments match the function\u2019s specification.\n\u2022 Inadequate handling of empty entity lists\n\u2003\u2013 Before iterating over the result from get_entities, check for None and default to an empty list to avoid \u201cNoneType\u201d iteration errors.\n\u2022 Lab placement without inventory verification\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that a Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n\u2022 Lab crafting failures due to missing sub-ingredients\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels and electronic circuits) are available or can be produced. Verify that resource flows (e.g. from smelting iron or copper plates) are sufficient to satisfy crafting prerequisites before reattempting Lab production."}
