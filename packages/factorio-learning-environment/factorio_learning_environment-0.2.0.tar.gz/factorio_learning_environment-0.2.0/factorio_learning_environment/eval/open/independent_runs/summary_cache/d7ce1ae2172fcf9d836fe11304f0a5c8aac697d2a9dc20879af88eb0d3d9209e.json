{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at (41.0, -86.0) and (43.0, -86.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (43.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -82.5) for storing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at (41.5, -83.5) for transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- **Transport Belt** at (41.5, -84.5) connecting the mining drill to the inserter.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position (-17.0, -52.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at (-17.0, -52.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (-16.5, -50.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at (-17.5, -50.5) for transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n#### Smelting Setup at Position (-15.0, -51.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at (-15.0, -51.0) and (-13.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at (-14.5, -52.5) for transferring items into the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (-13.5, -51.5) for storing smelted items.\n\n#### Additional Smelting Setup at Position (43.0, -79.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at (43.0, -79.0) for smelting operations.\n- **Burner Inserter** at (43.5, -80.5) and (44.5, -78.5) for transferring items into and out of the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (43.5, -76.5) for storing smelted items.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. Nearby entities like chests, furnaces, or other structures can block placement.\n- Increase spacing or change the direction of placement to avoid collisions.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts directly to furnaces\n- Use inserters to transfer items into furnaces instead of belts. Belts cannot directly input items into furnaces.\n\n#### Errors when placing inserters near furnaces\n- Avoid placing inserters in positions where they collide with existing structures like chests or furnaces. Adjust spacing or direction to ensure proper placement.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills run out of fuel or chests are full\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to ensure continuous operation.\n- Empty chests at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue extracting resources.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces lack ingredients\n- Ensure inserters are correctly placed and fueled to transfer ingredients into furnaces. Verify that the source chests contain the necessary items."}
