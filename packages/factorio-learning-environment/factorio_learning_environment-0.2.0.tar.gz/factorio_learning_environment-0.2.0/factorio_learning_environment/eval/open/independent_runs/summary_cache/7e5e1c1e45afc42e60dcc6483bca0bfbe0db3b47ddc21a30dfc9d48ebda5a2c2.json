{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is designed for mining and processing iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore from the resource patch. It is currently fueled with coal and is operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Serves as a storage unit for the extracted iron ore. The chest is connected to the mining drill and is positioned to collect ore directly from it.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It requires coal as fuel and is currently operational.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but currently lacks iron ore to process.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance of 10 units from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the desired location to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Issues with inserter alignment and operation\n- Regularly check the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of resources, leading to processing delays.\n\n### Insufficient fuel for entities\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Running out of fuel will halt operations and reduce efficiency.\n\n### Empty or low inventory in chests\n- Monitor the contents of storage chests to ensure they are not empty or low on resources. An empty chest will disrupt the flow of materials to subsequent processing stages.\n\n### Furnace not receiving ingredients\n- Verify the setup of inserters and ensure they are operational and correctly transferring resources into the furnace. Without the necessary ingredients, the furnace cannot produce output."}
