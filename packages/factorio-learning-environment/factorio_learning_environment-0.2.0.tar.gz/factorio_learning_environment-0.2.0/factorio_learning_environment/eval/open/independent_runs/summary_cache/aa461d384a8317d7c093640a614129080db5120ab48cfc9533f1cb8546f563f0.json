Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the entity type matches.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The same errors regarding the inability to place electric poles and the failure to retrieve the steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0) have been consistently occurring. Review the placement strategy and ensure that the intended positions are valid and accessible."}
