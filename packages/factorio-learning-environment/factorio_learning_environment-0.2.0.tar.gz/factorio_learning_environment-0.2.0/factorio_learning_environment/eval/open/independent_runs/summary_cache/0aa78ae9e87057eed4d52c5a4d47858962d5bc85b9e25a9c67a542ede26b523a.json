Always retrieve the current working fluid_system (now [36572]) from the boiler or offshore pump before initiating a connection.\n\n- Rigid Pipeline Stabilization:\n  \u2022 Using a fixed 10-second delay for pipeline stabilization consistently leads to premature connection attempts. Implement dynamic checks that confirm PipeGroup connectivity prior to proceeding.\n\n- Persistent Steam Engine Connection Failure:\n  \u2022 Continuous failures to connect the steam engine suggest misalignment between connection points or incompatibility with the active fluid system. Reassess the spatial configuration and ensure compatibility between the steam engine, boiler, and PipeGroups."}
