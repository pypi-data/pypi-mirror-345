{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -86.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -84.5)\n- Burner mining drill (position 43.0, -86.0) with a drop position at (43.5, -84.5)\n- Wooden chest (position 43.5, -84.5) for coal storage\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -82.5) for coal storage\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -17.0, -52.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -50.5)\n- Wooden chest (position -16.5, -50.5) for iron ore storage\n\n#### Furnace Setup at position (43.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 43.0, -79.0) for smelting iron plates\n- Wooden chest (position 43.5, -76.5) for storing smelted iron plates\n\n#### Furnace Setup at position (-15.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -51.0) for smelting iron plates\n- Wooden chest (position -13.5, -51.5) for storing smelted iron plates\n\n#### Furnace Setup at position (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -13.0, -50.0) for smelting iron plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., furnace) has space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. For example, the furnace at (43.0, -79.0) and (-15.0, -51.0) had full inventories, causing insertion failures.\n\n#### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specific position before attempting to interact with it. For example, attempting to access a transport belt at (41.5, -84.5) failed because no such entity exists.\n\n#### Errors due to blocked output in mining drills\n- Ensure the output of mining drills is not blocked. For example, the burner mining drill at (41.0, -86.0) is blocked because there is no sink entity to accept its output.\n\n#### Errors due to full chests\n- Empty chests that are full to allow mining drills to continue operation. For example, the chest at (43.5, -84.5) is full, preventing the mining drill at (43.0, -86.0) from operating.\n\n#### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure mining drills and furnaces are fueled. For example, the burner mining drill at (-17.0, -52.0) is out of fuel and cannot operate.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=10)`  \n  **Failure Mode**: Fails if the furnace inventory is full.  \n  **Success Mode**: Inserts coal into the furnace if there is space.\n\n- `get_entity(Prototype.TransportBelt, Position(x=41.5, y=-84.5))`  \n  **Failure Mode**: Fails if no transport belt exists at the specified position.  \n  **Success Mode**: Returns the transport belt entity if it exists.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: Represents a furnace entity, used for smelting operations.  \n- `blocked_belt`: Intended to represent a transport belt entity, but failed due to non-existence.  \n- `inventory`: Tracks the agent's current inventory, including items like coal, iron ore, and iron plates."}
