To mitigate, verify the current operational PipeGroup information and use the updated fluid_system ID (e.g., 19716) maintained by the boiler and offshore pump.\n\u2022 Pipeline Stabilization Efficiency:\n   - Consistent reliance on fixed 10-second delays for pipeline stabilization reduces efficiency. Employ dynamic status checks to confirm pipeline readiness before proceeding with subsequent connection attempts."}
