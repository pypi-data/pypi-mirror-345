This prevents errors such as failing to place a stone furnace (used as Copper Furnace) due to excessive distance from the target build location.\n\n\u2022 Invalid Output Extraction  \n  - Verify that an entity has completed its processing and contains the expected output before attempting extraction. This helps avoid errors when extracting items from a furnace that does not register the produced goods.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Failures from Missing Sub-ingredients  \n  - Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels dependent on iron plates) are available from proper production (smelting or assembling) before initiating complex crafting.  \n  - Additionally, complete prerequisite research to unlock recipes for advanced items such as assembling machines and labs.\n\n\u2022 Inserting Items into Full or Unavailable Inventories  \n  - Check that the target entity\u2019s inventory has sufficient capacity before trying to insert additional items (e.g., inserting wood into a furnace).  \n  - Validate that entities meant for placement (like labs) exist in inventory and are correctly referenced to avoid errors (such as a \u201cNameError\u201d when a lab is not defined).\n\n\u2022 General Inventory Verification  \n  - Consistently confirm that required entities are present in inventory prior to placing them on the map, ensuring that interactions are attempted only on valid and available objects.\n\n\u2022 Monitoring Research and Unlock Dependencies  \n  - Regularly verify that necessary research (e.g. Automation Technology) is completed so that advanced recipes become available, reducing crafting errors for items like assembling machines and labs."}
