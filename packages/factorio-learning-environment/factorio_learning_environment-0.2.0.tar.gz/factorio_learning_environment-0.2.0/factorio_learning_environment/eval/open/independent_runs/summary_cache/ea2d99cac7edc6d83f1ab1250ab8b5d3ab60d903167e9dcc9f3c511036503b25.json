{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (42.0, -83.0) with a direction of DOWN, connected to a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to a Stone Furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-15.0, -49.0) with a direction of UP, producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (42.5, -81.5) with a direction of RIGHT, transferring items from the mining drill to the transport belt.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Transport Belt at Position (43.5, -82.5) aligned correctly, facilitating the movement of resources.\n- Transport Belt at Position (43.5, -80.5) aligned correctly, part of the belt network connecting various entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place a Wooden Chest or Burner Inserter. This will prevent placement errors like those encountered at positions such as (45.0, -79.5) and (44.5, -79.5).\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Address the warning of \"output blocked by item on the ground\" for the Burner Mining Drill by ensuring that there is a sink entity or storage to accept the output.\n\n### Errors with full output in furnaces\n- Monitor the Stone Furnace's output inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which halts production. Ensure there is a mechanism to regularly extract the produced items.\n\n### Errors with full chests\n- Avoid the \"chest is full\" warning for the Burner Inserter by ensuring that there is enough space in connected chests or storage entities to accommodate transferred items."}
