{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Fuel: 4 units of coal\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n    - Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Drop Position: (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Resources: 9998 units of iron ore\n\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (5.5, -60.5)\n  - (7.5, -60.5)\n  - (6.5, -60.5)\n  - (9.5, -60.5)\n  - (8.5, -60.5)\n  - (4.5, -58.5) with 7 units of iron ore\n  - (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n    - Fuel: 2 units of coal\n    - Status: WORKING\n    - Furnace Source: 4 units of iron ore\n    - Furnace Result: 69 units of iron plate\n  - (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n    - Fuel: 6 units of coal\n    - Status: WORKING\n    - Furnace Source: 2 units of iron ore\n    - Furnace Result: 63 units of iron plate\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n    - Fuel: 17 units of coal\n    - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n    - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n    - Furnace Result: 25 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from halting operations due to a full chest.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Shortage\n- Make sure to supply sufficient ingredients to the furnaces at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) to maintain continuous smelting operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int - Represents the amount of iron ore extracted and inserted into furnaces.\n- `coal`: int - Represents the amount of coal used as fuel in the burner mining drill and furnaces.\n- `iron_plate`: int - Represents the amount of iron plates produced by the furnaces."}
