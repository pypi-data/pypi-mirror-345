{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed for the extraction and smelting of iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled by coal, actively extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) used for storing extracted materials.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-13.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -47.5), facilitating the movement of items between entities.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0), used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the target entity has enough space to accommodate the items you are trying to insert. Check the inventory capacity before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Verify that the entity you are extracting from contains the items you wish to extract. Ensure that the extraction quantity does not exceed the available items in the entity.\n\n### Blockage at inserter drop positions\n- Regularly check and clear the drop positions of inserters to prevent blockages. Ensure that the destination has enough space to accept items from the inserter.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract with incorrect parameters\n- Double-check the parameters used in extraction functions, such as the correct entity and quantity. Ensure that the entity is accessible and the quantity is valid for extraction.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources in inventory\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of necessary resources like coal in your inventory to avoid errors when refueling or inserting items into entities."}
