Clear non\u2010critical objects cautiously, avoiding removal of essential entities (such as the Boiler).\n\n\u2022 Reference Validation:\n\u2003\u2013 Before using relative placement functions (e.g. place_entity_next_to), confirm that the reference (local) entity is valid and not nil to prevent nil-indexing errors.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Connection and Alignment:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that pipe endpoints on the Boiler and Steam Engines are properly aligned and within close proximity. Adjust positions or clear blockages if pipe connection attempts fail.\n\n\u2022 Operational Consistency:\n\u2003\u2013 Use standardized API calls and proper attribute access to ensure consistent behavior. Validate buildable areas and spacing parameters before placement to help mitigate repeated placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Multiple Candidate Coordination:\n\u2003\u2013 In cases where manual placement attempts fail across several candidate coordinates, reassess the surrounding obstructions and consider alternative positions that do not interfere with critical structures.\n\n\u2022 Pre-Operational Checks:\n\u2003\u2013 Prior to repositioning or placement, thoroughly verify that all environment and inventory checks have been completed to catch potential obstructions and avoid misplacement errors."}
