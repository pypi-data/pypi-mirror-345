{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest. Misalignment prevents the inserter from picking up items. Verify that the pickup position matches the chest's position.\n\n### Inserter Drop Position Errors\n- Confirm that the inserter's drop position is aligned with the furnace. Misalignment can prevent items from being transferred to the furnace.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters. Running out of coal can halt operations.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Check that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to operate. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, verify the inserter setup and alignment to ensure proper item transfer."}
