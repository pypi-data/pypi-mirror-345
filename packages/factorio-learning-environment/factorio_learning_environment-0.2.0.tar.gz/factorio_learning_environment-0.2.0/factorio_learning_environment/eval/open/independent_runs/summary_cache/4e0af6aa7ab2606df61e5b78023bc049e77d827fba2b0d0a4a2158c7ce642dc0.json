{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source (chest) and destination (furnace) entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring items effectively.\n\n### Errors When Refueling\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel. This ensures continuous operation without interruptions.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is unoccupied. Attempting to place an entity where another already exists will result in placement errors. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts."}
