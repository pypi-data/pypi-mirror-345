{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these components, with various pipe segments from Position (-47.5, -122.5) to Position (-40.5, -116.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with small electric poles from Position (-52.5, -114.5) to Position (-39.5, -117.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Additional Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) and a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Storage Chests\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with no power, requiring automation science packs\n\n### Additional PipeGroups\n- Multiple PipeGroups in various positions, currently empty and not connected to any active fluid systems\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between entities. The offshore pump and boiler, as well as the boiler and steam engine, failed to connect due to misalignment or incorrect positioning.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is correctly connected to the power network and has a sufficient input of steam. Check the fluid connections and ensure there are no blockages.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that the inserter is properly connected to a powered electric pole. Check the electricity network for connectivity issues.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check fuel levels in burner mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply them with raw materials to maintain production.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Monitor the inventory of chests connected to mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
