{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Pipe Network at Position (-0.5, 21.5)\nConsists of a series of connected pipes forming a fluid system. The pipes are positioned at:\n- (x=-0.5, y=21.5)\n- (x=1.5, y=21.5)\n- (x=0.5, y=21.5)\n- ...\n- (x=8.5, y=21.5)\n- (x=9.5, y=21.5)\n- (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of electric poles positioned at:\n- (x=12.5, y=23.5)\n- (x=24.5, y=22.5)\n- (x=16.5, y=24.5)\n- ...\n- (x=3.5, y=20.5)\n- (x=14.5, y=20.5)\n- (x=35.5, y=20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Usage in Function Calls\n- When using functions like `pickup_entity`, ensure that the second argument is a Position object or None if the first argument is an Entity object. Avoid providing incorrect types or unnecessary arguments.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Missing Entities\n- Before asserting the presence of entities like steam engines or boilers, verify their existence on the map to prevent assertion errors.\n\n### Errors due to Distance Limitations\n- Ensure that the player is within the maximum allowable distance when attempting to place entities. Move closer to the target position if necessary.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- When retrieving entities using functions like `get_entity`, ensure that the specified position is correct and that the entity exists at that position to avoid exceptions."}
