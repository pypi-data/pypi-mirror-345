For example, iron plates must be smelted in a furnace, and wood must be gathered as it is a raw resource.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. Consider adjusting the spacing or direction if an entity is already present.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are properly defined before use. Double-check variable names and ensure they are initialized correctly.\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Verify that you have the required quantity of items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity."}
