{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input, producing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), (-5.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled by coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items due to lack of inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities. For instance, attempting to insert coal into a drill without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to full storage chests\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. For example, the chest at (4.5, -58.5) was full, preventing further mining.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Function used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the item and quantity are available in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
