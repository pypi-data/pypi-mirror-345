{"content": "I can now analyze the interaction patterns with the Factorio API based on our attempts:\n\nSuccessful Patterns:\n1. Inventory Management:\n- Using `inspect_inventory()` reliably shows current items\n- Checking inventory before crafting prevents errors\n- The inventory is automatically updated after crafting\n\n2. Crafting:\n- `craft_item()` works well when we have required materials\n- Best to calculate maximum possible items before crafting\n- Recipe checking with `get_prototype_recipe()` helps verify requirements\n\n3. Furnace Interaction:\n- `get_entities()` successfully returns furnace status\n- Extracting items from furnaces works with `extract_item()`\n- Moving to furnace position before extraction is important\n\nCommon Errors & Solutions:\n1. Resource Insertion:\n- Cannot insert resources we don't have in inventory\n- Need to check inventory before attempting insertion\n- Got \"No iron-ore to insert\" error when trying to refill furnaces\n\n2. Recipe Limitations:\n- Recipes show as \"enabled=False\" but still allow crafting\n- Need to calculate material requirements carefully\n- Better to use minimum between desired quantity and possible quantity\n\nTips for Future:\n1. Always check inventory before operations\n2. Use defensive programming:\n```python\nif Prototype.IronOre in inventory:\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=25)\n```\n3. Extract items from furnaces before they're full\n4. Calculate maximum possible crafting based on available materials\n5. Move to correct position before attempting interactions\n\nRecommended Pattern:\n```python\n# Check inventory first\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Calculate maximum possible crafting\nmax_possible = inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) // 2\nif max_possible > 0:\n    craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=max_possible)\n\n# Extract from furnaces\nfor furnace in get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace}):\n    if furnace.furnace_result.get('iron-plate', 0) > 0:\n        move_to(furnace.position)\n        extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, quantity=25)\n```", "summary_range": "[1-202]"}
