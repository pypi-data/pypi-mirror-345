The agent repeatedly picks up the iron ore from the belt to unblock the drill. This indicates a bottleneck in the ore transportation system.\n### Plate inserter waiting for source items\n- The plate inserter at x=5.5 y=-59.5 is frequently waiting for source items, but the chest at x=4.5 y=-58.5 has 10 iron plates. This indicates an issue with the inserter configuration or the chest placement.\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n -  Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place a entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n# NAMESPACE\n```"}
