{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with drop position at (4.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing iron ore\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -52.5), (-2.5, -52.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n- Iron Chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Furnace Array\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with warnings of being out of fuel and full furnace result\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt and full furnace result\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from a full chest\n- Ensure that the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is emptied before attempting to extract more iron ore from it. This will allow the burner mining drill to continue mining operations without interruption.\n\n### Errors due to out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) and stone furnaces to prevent them from stopping operations due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Errors due to full furnace result\n- Regularly empty the furnace results to ensure that the furnaces can continue smelting operations without being halted by full output inventories.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore_chest_position`: Position of the chest storing iron ore, type: Tuple[float, float]\n  - `iron_plate_inventory`: Inventory of iron plates, type: Dict[str, int]\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Position of the burner mining drill, type: Tuple[float, float]"}
