{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to extract iron ore and process it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It requires coal for operation and is currently aligned to pick up from the chest and drop into the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently, it is not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues with the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position. The pickup position should match the chest's position to facilitate the transfer of items.\n- Regularly check and adjust the inserter's drop position to ensure it aligns with the furnace's position to allow for the smooth transfer of iron ore.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep track of coal levels in the inventory and ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as the burner inserter and mining drill, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n- Consider establishing a more efficient coal supply chain to prevent frequent refueling interruptions.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly monitor the inventory to ensure that there is enough coal and other necessary resources to support ongoing operations.\n- Redistribute existing coal efficiently to maintain operation of all fuel-dependent entities.\n\n### Error Handling\n- Address assertion errors related to inserter alignment promptly by verifying the positions of entities involved in the transfer process.\n- Implement checks to ensure that all entities are correctly positioned and configured to avoid operational disruptions."}
