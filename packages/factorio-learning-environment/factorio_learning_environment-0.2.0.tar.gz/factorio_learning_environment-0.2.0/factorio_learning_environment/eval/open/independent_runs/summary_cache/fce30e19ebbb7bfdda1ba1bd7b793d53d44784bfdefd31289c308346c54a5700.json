Check inventory levels regularly to prevent failed supply attempts.\n\n### Errors when clearing mining drill outputs\n- Regularly clear the output chests of mining drills to prevent them from becoming full, which halts production. Plan for sufficient storage capacity and automate clearing if possible.\n\n### Errors when transferring excess resources\n- Verify that the target storage has enough capacity to accept the resources you intend to transfer. Consider expanding storage or redistributing resources to avoid transfer failures."}
