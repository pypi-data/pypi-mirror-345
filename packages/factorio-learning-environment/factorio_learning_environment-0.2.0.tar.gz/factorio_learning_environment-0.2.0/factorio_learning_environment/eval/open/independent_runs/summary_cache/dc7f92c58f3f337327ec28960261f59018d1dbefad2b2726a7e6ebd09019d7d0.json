{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation System\n- **Steam Engine** at position (5.5, 21.5) connected to the power network, working status.\n- **Boiler** at position (-1.5, 24.0) fueled with coal, working status.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water, working status.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting offshore pump to boiler, and boiler to steam engine.\n\n### Lab and Research Setup\n- **Lab** at position (2.5, 0.5) connected to the power network, conducting Automation research.\n\n### Power Network\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at positions (1.5, 14.5), (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 6.5), (1.5, 10.5), and (1.5, 2.5), providing power to connected structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Lab Setup\n- Ensure that the lab is correctly placed and connected to the power network before attempting to start research.\n- Verify that the lab exists at the specified position before checking its status or setting research.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that you have the required items in your inventory to complete the connections.\n- Double-check the positions of pipes and ensure they are properly aligned for fluid transfer.\n\n### Errors in Refueling\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in your inventory to refuel the boiler consistently. Harvest more coal if necessary to avoid interruptions in power generation.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Steam Engine\n- Regularly check the status of the steam engine to ensure it is working. If not, inspect the connections and fuel supply to diagnose the issue.\n\n### NameError for Lab\n- Ensure that the correct class or object name is used when referencing the lab in your code. Double-check for typos or incorrect references."}
