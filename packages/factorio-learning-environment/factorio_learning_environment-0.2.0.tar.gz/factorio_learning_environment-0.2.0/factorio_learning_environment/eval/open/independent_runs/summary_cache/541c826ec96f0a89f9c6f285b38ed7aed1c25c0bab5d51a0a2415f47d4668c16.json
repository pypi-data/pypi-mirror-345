{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0) fueled with coal\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with iron ore as input and iron plates as output\n- Inserter 1 at position (17.5, 0.5) and Inserter 2 at position (16.5, 0.5) for moving items between entities\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) and another at position (18.5, 0.5) for storage\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5) connecting various entities\n- PipeGroup at position (0.5, 16.5) connecting various entities\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5) connecting various entities\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (16.5, 8.5), (7.5, 10.5), and (17.5, -0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Power Connectivity\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the power network. Check connections between steam engines, boilers, and inserters to the electricity network.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid-requiring entities like boilers and steam engines are properly connected to a fluid source. Ensure that offshore pumps are correctly placed and connected to the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory. For example, ensure iron ore is available before attempting to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that it is available in your inventory. For example, ensure you have an offshore pump available before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Ensure inserters are correctly positioned and powered to move items between entities effectively. Check that inserters have a valid source and destination for items."}
