{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and is currently fueled with coal. It is operational but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - This chest stores the extracted iron ore from the mining drill. It has been reported to contain varying amounts of iron ore, sometimes being low or empty.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - This inserter is intended to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It requires coal as fuel and has been repositioned multiple times to ensure proper alignment.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - This furnace is intended to smelt the iron ore into iron plates. It is currently fueled with coal but has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items between the chest and the furnace. Reposition the inserter if necessary.\n- Regularly check and refuel the inserter with coal to maintain its operation.\n\n### Errors with Chest Inventory Management\n- Regularly monitor the chest inventory to ensure it is not full, which would halt the mining drill's operation. Extract iron ore from the chest to free up space as needed.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving iron ore from the inserter. Check the inserter setup and alignment if the furnace is not receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors with Extracting Items\n- When extracting items from a chest, ensure the quantity specified is greater than zero to avoid extraction errors."}
