{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of 4 stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) \n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients but have coal fuel\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around y=24 coordinates, consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler with water\n- Pipe network connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Electric pole network connecting power to lab\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at (10.5, 0.5) with automation science packs loaded\n- Connected to power network but currently unpowered\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting crafting operations\n- Check if raw materials need to be gathered/smelted before attempting to craft items that require processed materials\n\n### Recipe Requirements Errors\n- Some items like copper plates and iron plates cannot be crafted directly - they require smelting in furnaces\n- Wood is a raw resource that must be gathered, not crafted\n\n### Building Placement Errors\n- Ensure required building/entity is in inventory before attempting placement\n- When placing connected systems (like power/fluid), ensure all required connection components are available\n\n### Programming/API Errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations directly on prototype attributes\n- When connecting entities, ensure required connection items (like pipes) are in inventory\n\n### Power System Errors\n- Ensure boilers have fuel to generate steam\n- Power network needs to be properly connected with poles to provide electricity to machines"}
