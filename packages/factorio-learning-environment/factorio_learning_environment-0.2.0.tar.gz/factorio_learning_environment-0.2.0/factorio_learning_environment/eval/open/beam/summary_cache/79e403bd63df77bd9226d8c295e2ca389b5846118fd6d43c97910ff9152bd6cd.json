{"content": "I notice the error occurs because we're trying to reference inserters that don't exist in the game world. Let's modify our approach to first verify what entities actually exist and then work with them:\n\n```python\n# First let's check what entities we actually have\ndef print_entities():\n    all_entities = get_entities()\n    print(\"\\nExisting entities:\")\n    for entity in all_entities:\n        print(f\"Type: {entity.prototype}, Position: {entity.position}, Status: {entity.status}\")\n\n# Check our inventory\nprint(f\"\\nCurrent inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Print existing entities\nprint_entities()\n\n# Let's set up the basic automation chain\ntry:\n    # First place a burner mining drill\n    move_to(Position(-20, 22))\n    place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(-20, 22), Direction.EAST)\n    \n    # Place a chest to collect ore\n    move_to(Position(-19, 22))\n    place_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, Position(-19, 22))\n    \n    # Place burner inserter\n    place_entity(Prototype.BurnerInserter, Position(-18, 22), Direction.EAST)\n    \n    # Place stone furnace\n    move_to(Position(-17, 22))\n    place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Position(-17, 22))\n    \n    # Add fuel to all machines\n    for entity in get_entities():\n        if entity.status == \"NO_FUEL\":\n            move_to(entity.position)\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, entity, quantity=1)\n            print(f\"Added fuel to {entity.prototype} at {entity.position}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSetup complete. Final entity status:\")\n    print_entities()\n    \nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error during setup: {e}\")\n```\n\nThis revised approach:\n1. Checks what entities actually exist before trying to reference them\n2. Creates a complete automation chain if it doesn't exist\n3. Adds fuel to any machine that needs it\n4. Provides better visibility into the current game state\n\nTips from this iteration:\n1. Always verify entity existence before trying to reference them\n2. Use try/except blocks to handle potential errors\n3. Print detailed status information to understand the current state\n4. Build the automation chain step by step with verification at each step\n\nLet me know what entities are actually present in the game world, and we can adjust our approach accordingly.", "summary_range": "[1-3842]"}
