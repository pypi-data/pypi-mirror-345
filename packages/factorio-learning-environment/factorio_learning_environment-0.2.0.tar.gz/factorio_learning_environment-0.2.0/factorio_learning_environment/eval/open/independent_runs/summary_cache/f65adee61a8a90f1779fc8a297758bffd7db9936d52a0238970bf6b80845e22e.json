{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace cluster at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), and (2.0, 2.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel: coal (13), status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Furnace (position (2.0, 0.0)) with fuel: coal (6), status: NO_INGREDIENTS, producing iron plates (18)\n- Furnace (position (2.0, 2.0)) with fuel: coal (20), status: NO_INGREDIENTS, producing iron plates (20)\n\n### Wooden chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (5.5, 0.5)) with inventory containing iron plates (160)\n\n### Lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (10.5, 10.5)) with status: NO_POWER\n\n### Electricity generator at position (6.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Small electric pole (position (6.5, 0.5)) connected to the lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of:\n- Small electric pole (position (12.5, 13.5)) connected to the lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\n- Small electric pole (position (11.5, 13.5)) connected to the lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\n- Small electric pole (position (10.5, 13.5)) connected to the lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. In this case, small electric poles were required to connect the lab to the power source.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with incorrect entity types\n- Ensure that when using functions that require an entity or entity group, you are passing the correct type and not a position. This was encountered when inserting items into furnaces.\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure there is a clear space for placing electric poles. If there is an existing object in the way, the placement will fail.\n\n### Errors with missing inventory items\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to place or connect entities. If you run out of items, you will not be able to perform the action."}
