{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, including underground pipes starting at (-7.5, 23.5)\n\n### Inserter Power Network\nConsists of:\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) connected to a power network\n- Small electric poles facilitating the power connection\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a status indicating no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserters positioned to interact with the furnace and wooden chests\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 21991) at position (-1.5, 17.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 21995) at position (-8.5, 20.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 22004) at position (-7.5, 25.5) with status EMPTY\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes and underground pipe ends is clear and correctly aligned with existing pipe networks to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connectivity Issues\n- Verify that the boiler and steam engine are correctly connected to the water supply and each other to ensure they are operational. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that all inserters are connected to a power source and are receiving electricity to function properly. Check the connectivity of electric poles and ensure they are linked to a power source."}
