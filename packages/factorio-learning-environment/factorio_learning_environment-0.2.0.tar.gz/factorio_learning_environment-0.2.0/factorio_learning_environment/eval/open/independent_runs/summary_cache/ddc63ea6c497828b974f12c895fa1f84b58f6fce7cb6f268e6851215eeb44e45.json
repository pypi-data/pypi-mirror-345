{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for electricity distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnaces at Positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) for producing copper cables\n- Inserter at Position (9.5, 5.5) to supply copper plates to the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-3.5, 0.5) and (-3.5, 2.5) for storing items\n- Inserters at Positions (-3.5, 1.5) and (9.5, 5.5) for transferring items between entities\n- Transport Belts at various positions for item movement\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the entity contains the item you want to extract before attempting extraction. For example, verify that the assembling machine contains copper cables before extracting.\n\n### Assembling Machine Not Producing\n- Ensure that the assembling machine is receiving power and has the necessary ingredients to produce the desired item. Check connections and power supply to the assembling machine.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters without Power\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source and receiving electricity to function properly. Check the status of nearby electric poles and connections.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and receiving steam. Check the pipe connections and ensure there is no blockage or disconnection."}
