{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at position (60.0, -55.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (60.0, -55.0)\n\nThe stone furnace is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Coal is used as fuel for the smelting process.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. In Step 2, the variable 'crafted' was not defined, which led to a NameError.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Verify the presence of items in the entity before attempting extraction. In Steps 7 and 9, attempts to extract iron plates from the stone furnace failed because the furnace did not contain the expected items.\n- In Steps 24 through 31, and Steps 32, 36 through 42, attempts to extract copper plates from the stone furnace failed because the furnace did not contain the expected copper plates. Ensure that the furnace has completed smelting and contains the desired items before extraction.\n- In Steps 45 through 47, and Steps 48 through 63, attempts to extract iron plates from the stone furnace failed because the furnace did not contain the expected iron plates. Verify that the smelting process is complete and the items are available before extraction.\n\n### Assertion errors due to mismatched expectations\n- Double-check the expected state of entities against their actual state. Steps 10 through 14 encountered AssertionErrors due to mismatched expectations of iron plate counts in the furnace. Ensure that the logic for counting or tracking items is accurate and aligns with the actual game state.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available before attempting to smelt or craft items. In Step 31, the stone furnace had a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt', indicating a lack of necessary materials for the smelting process.\n- In Step 43, and Step 54, the furnace had no coal available for smelting ore. Ensure that sufficient fuel is available before starting the smelting process.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the entity is ready to accept the items being inserted. In Step 32, an attempt to insert iron ore into the furnace failed due to the absence of iron ore in the inventory.\n- In Steps 34 and 35, attempts to insert iron ore into the furnace failed because the furnace already contained copper ore. Ensure that the furnace is empty or contains the correct type of ore before inserting additional materials."}
