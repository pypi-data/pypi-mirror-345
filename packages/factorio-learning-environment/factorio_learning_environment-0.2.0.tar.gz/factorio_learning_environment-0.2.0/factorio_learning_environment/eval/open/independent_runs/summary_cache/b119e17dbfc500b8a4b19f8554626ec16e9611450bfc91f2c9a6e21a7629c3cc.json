{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production at position(16, 71)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position (16.0, 71.0)) \n- Stone furnace (position (16.0, 73.0))\n- Burner inserter (position (16.5, 75.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (16.5, 69.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (16.5, 74.5))\n- BeltGroup (positions (16.5, 68.5) to (16.5, 76.5))\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when connecting entities directly\n  - Ensure that you are not trying to connect entities directly that do not support direct connection. For example, transport belts cannot be connected directly to a furnace. Instead, use an inserter to input items into the furnace.\n* Errors when placing entities next to each other\n  - Ensure that the space next to the entity you are trying to place another entity is not occupied. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction of placement.\n* Errors when accessing non-existent attributes of an entity or a list\n  - Ensure that the attribute you are trying to access exists for the entity or the type of object. For example, 'Furnace' object has certain attributes, 'list' object has no attribute 'status'. Check the entity's or object's documentation to see what attributes are available.\n* Errors when there is no valid path to normalize between entities\n  - Ensure that there is a valid path between entities you are trying to connect. For example, between a burner-mining-drill and a burner-inserter.\n* Errors when furnace result is full\n  - Ensure that the furnace result is extracted before it becomes full to avoid production halt.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure that all variables used in the code are defined before they are used. Check for typos and undefined names.\n* Errors when trying to place an entity at an occupied position\n  - Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when trying to access attributes of a 'Position' object\n  - Ensure that you are not trying to access attributes that do not exist for a 'Position' object. For example, a 'Position' object does not have a 'name' attribute.\n* Errors when placing iron ore at an occupied position\n  - Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place iron ore.\n* Errors when the first argument is not an Entity or Prototype object\n  - Ensure that the first argument passed to the function is an Entity or Prototype object.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables that have been assigned:\n- `{'wooden-chest': 9, 'storage-tank': 10, 'transport-belt': 487, 'underground-belt': 100, 'burner-inserter': 48, 'inserter': 50, 'small-electric-pole': 500, 'pipe': 500, 'pipe-to-ground': 100, 'boiler': 2, 'steam-engine': 2, 'burner-mining-drill': 49, 'electric-mining-drill': 50, 'offshore-pump': 2, 'pumpjack': 10, 'stone-furnace': 9, 'electric-furnace': 10, 'assembling-machine-2': 10, 'oil-refinery': 5, 'chemical-plant': 5, 'coal': 240, 'iron-ore': 49, 'iron-plate': 100}` (dict) representing the current inventory."}
