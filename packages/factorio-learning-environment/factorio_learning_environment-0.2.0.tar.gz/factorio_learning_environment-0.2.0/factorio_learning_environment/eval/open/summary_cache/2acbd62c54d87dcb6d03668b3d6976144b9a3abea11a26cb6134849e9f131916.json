{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently without power and reporting output blockage due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and working, but frequently full on input inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and newly placed at (21.5, 76.5), all fueled with coal and operational, transferring iron plates between chests.\n- Small electric poles at (15.5, 75.5) and newly placed at (21.5, 74.5) powering inserters.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace drop position remains unresolved, preventing smooth output flow.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and iron plate storage with improved inserter fueling and power coverage, though output flow bottlenecks persist.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) currently out of fuel and not operating.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) not connected to power network and lacking input fluid, thus not generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5) forming partial power network.\n\nThis structure is currently non-operational due to boiler fuel depletion and steam engine disconnection from the power grid.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), not receiving power and unable to craft due to missing iron plates.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) intended to supply iron plates, currently empty.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), empty.\n- Burner inserters at (25.5, 83.5) and (20.5, 77.5), fueled and operational, but waiting for source items.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5) connected to power network but not powering the assembling machine due to disconnection.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with inserter and power pole placement, but remains inactive due to lack of power and input materials.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace output belt\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked due to full furnace output belt and chests.\n- To resolve, ensure output belts and chests connected to the furnace can accept items by clearing or extending them.\n- Regularly monitor furnace output inventory to prevent smelting stoppage.\n\n### Power network and entity connection issues\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, causing steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) to lack steam input and remain unpowered.\n- Steam engine is also not connected to the power network, preventing power generation.\n- Small electric pole placement attempts near steam engine, furnace, and mining drill repeatedly fail due to occupied tiles.\n- Verify tile availability before placing poles and consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or repositioning reference points to avoid placement conflicts.\n- Maintain continuous fuel supply to boilers and ensure power poles form a connected network to all machines.\n\n### Inserter fueling and source item availability\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), (21.5, 76.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are fueled and operational.\n- However, inserters feeding the assembling machine and chests often wait for source items due to empty input inventories.\n- Ensure sufficient iron plates are inserted into input chests feeding assembling machines to prevent inserter starvation.\n\n### Assembling machine operation and input supply\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) remains unpowered and without input materials, preventing crafting.\n- Input and output inventories remain empty despite inserter activity.\n- Connect assembling machine to power network and supply iron plates to input chest to enable production.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
