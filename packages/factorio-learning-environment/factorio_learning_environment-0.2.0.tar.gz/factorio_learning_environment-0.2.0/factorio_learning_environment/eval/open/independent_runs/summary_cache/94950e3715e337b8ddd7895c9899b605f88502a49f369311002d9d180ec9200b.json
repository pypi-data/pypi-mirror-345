Check for gaps in belt placement, especially at positions like (-19.5, -66.5), to ensure successful connections between entities.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items. Ensure that the source container or belt is supplying items for the inserter to operate efficiently."}
