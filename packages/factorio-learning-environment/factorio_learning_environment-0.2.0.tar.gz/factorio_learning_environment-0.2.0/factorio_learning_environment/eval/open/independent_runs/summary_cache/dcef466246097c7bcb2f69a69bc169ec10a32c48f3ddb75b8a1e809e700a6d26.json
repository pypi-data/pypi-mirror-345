Multiple attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) were made, but none completed due to resource and crafting issues. No other new structures were constructed during this execution sequence.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 get_entities Usage Errors\n  \u2013 Use the correct argument format for get_entities. Do not supply unsupported keywords (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n  \u2013 Check the function\u2019s return value before iterating; if it returns None, convert it to an empty list to avoid iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures\n  \u2013 Verify that the Lab item is available in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n  \u2013 Ensure that the target placement tile is unoccupied and that all conditions for placement are met.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Ingredient Shortages\n  \u2013 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients for Lab crafting (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available or can be produced via proper smelting routes.\n  \u2013 Adjust resource processing (for example, smelting additional iron and copper plates) to meet the recipe requirements and avoid missing-ingredient errors.\n\n\u2022 Iteration on None Errors\n  \u2013 Always validate that functions returning lists (such as get_entities) are not yielding None before performing list comprehensions or iterations."}
