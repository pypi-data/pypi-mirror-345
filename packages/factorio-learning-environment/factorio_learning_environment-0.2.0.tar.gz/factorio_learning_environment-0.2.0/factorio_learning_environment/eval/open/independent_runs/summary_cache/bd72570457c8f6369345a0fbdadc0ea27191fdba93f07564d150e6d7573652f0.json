{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo permanent structures have been successfully created on the map. Although several recovery updates were aimed at supplying a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5), all attempts\u2014from querying for an existing Lab to placing or crafting one\u2014failed due to inventory shortages and missing sub-ingredients. Other entities (such as furnaces used for smelting in the recovery process) were referenced for production purposes but were not newly built structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval\n  - When calling get_entities, ensure parameters match its defined signature. Avoid passing unexpected keywords (e.g., using \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Handling Non\u2010Iterable Returns\n  - Check that the return value from get_entities is valid (not None) before iterating. Default to an empty list if no entities are returned.\n\n\u2022 Structure Placement Failures\n  - Verify that required items (such as a Lab) exist in the inventory before attempting placement to prevent placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Requirements\n  - Ensure that all sub-ingredients for Lab crafting are producible. Establish and verify production chains for items like iron-plate (for iron-gear-wheel), copper-plate and copper-cable (for electronic-circuit), so that resource shortages do not block Lab creation.\n  - Confirm that the ingredient quantities meet recipe requirements; recurring errors like missing iron-gear-wheel indicate a need to pre-supply the expected amounts before reattempting crafting.\n\nNAMESPACE\n(No user-defined functions were identified.)"}
