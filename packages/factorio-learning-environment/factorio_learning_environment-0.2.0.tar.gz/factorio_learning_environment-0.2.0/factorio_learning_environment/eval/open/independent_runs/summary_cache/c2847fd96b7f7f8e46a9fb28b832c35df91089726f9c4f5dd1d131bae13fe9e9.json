{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer Station at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with inventory containing 800 units of coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with 7 units of coal as fuel, connected to the chest at (40.5, -83.5) and a burner inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) with 1 unit of coal as fuel, transferring coal from the chest at (42.5, -83.5) to the chest at (40.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) with inventory containing 448 units of coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with 5 units of coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) with inventory containing 5 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) with inventory containing 5 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) with inventory containing 5 units of coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with 13 units of coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Inventory\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests to prevent mining operations from halting. The chest at position (40.5, -83.5) is full, causing the burner mining drill and burner inserter to stop functioning efficiently.\n\n### Errors Related to Lack of Smelting Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Both stone furnaces at positions (61.0, -54.0) and (64.0, -53.0) are not operational due to a lack of smelting ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', and 'iron-plate'.\n- `entities`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities on the map, including chests, mining drills, inserters, and furnaces."}
