{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) storing iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=-52.5) storing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from a full chest\n- Ensure the chest at the drop position of the mining drill is not full before attempting to extract items. Consider emptying the chest or using a larger storage solution.\n\n### Errors when furnace output is full\n- Regularly check and empty the furnace output to prevent production halts. Consider using inserters to automate the removal of smelted materials.\n\n### Errors when furnace lacks ingredients\n- Ensure a steady supply of raw materials to the furnaces to maintain continuous production. Automate the supply chain with belts or inserters if necessary.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_chest_position: Position` - Position of the chest storing iron ore at (x=4.5, y=-58.5).\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position: Position` - Position of the burner mining drill at (x=4.0, y=-60.0).\n  - `furnace_positions: List[Position]` - Positions of the stone furnaces at (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0).\n  - `iron_plate_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Inventory of iron plates in various chests."}
