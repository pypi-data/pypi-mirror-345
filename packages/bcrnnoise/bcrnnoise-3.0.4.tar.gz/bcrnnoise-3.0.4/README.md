Supports simulation via ODEs, Markov chains, and SDEs with Gaussian and custom noise terms.

Up on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bcrnnoise/) and installable via `pip install bcrnnoise`.

Check out [`example_rna.py`](https://github.com/BioDisCo/bcrnnoise/blob/main/examples/example_rna.py) for an example.
