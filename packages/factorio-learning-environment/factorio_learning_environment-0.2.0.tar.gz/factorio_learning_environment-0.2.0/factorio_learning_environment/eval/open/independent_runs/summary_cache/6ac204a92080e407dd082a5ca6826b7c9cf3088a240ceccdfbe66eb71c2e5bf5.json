{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. It currently lacks fuel for the boiler and the steam engine is not connected to the boiler output.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Offshore Pump at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n*   PipeGroup connecting pump to boiler (positions include x=-8.5,y=-0.5 to x=-4.5,y=0.5)\n*   Boiler at Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n*   PipeGroup intended for steam output (positions include x=-6.5,y=2.5 to x=-2.5,y=6.5)\n*   Steam Engine at Position(x=0.5, y=6.5)\n*   Small Electric Pole at Position(x=0.5, y=4.5) (Part of a larger disconnected pole group)\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Setup (Incomplete) at Position(x=22.5, y=8.5) to (x=26.0, y=17.5)\nThis structure is intended to mine coal, smelt it into iron plates (incorrectly configured), and assemble iron gear wheels. It is currently non-functional due to missing power connections, incorrect furnace inputs/outputs, missing inserters, and incorrect assembler recipe inputs.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Electric Mining Drill at Position(x=22.5, y=8.5) (Mining Coal)\n*   Electric Mining Drill at Position(x=25.5, y=8.5) (Mining Coal)\n*   Stone Furnace at"}
