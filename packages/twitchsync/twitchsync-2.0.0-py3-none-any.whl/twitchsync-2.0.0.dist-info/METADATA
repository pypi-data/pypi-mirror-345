# StreamSync

Syncs twitch clips with other streamers. 

Input a twitch clip url, slug, or vod timestamp with a list of streamers, and the program will output a list of timestamped urls for the same moment in each streamer's vod.

```
$ python -m streamsync https://www.twitch.tv/thebigmeech/clip/AgreeableNurturingFishPanicVis-g_-jghN2s5rElLpo sgtapollo lisajfc thebigmeech

```

## Installation
`pip install streamsync`
Requires a twitch developer application code. To get one log into the twitch developer with your twitch account https://dev.twitch.tv/console Then regester a new application, with category Application Integration and Confidential client type. Then once it is created click Manage -> New Secret and generate a new secret. Save this secret and the Client ID in a text file somewhere you will find them.

Before your first run, set the environment variables:
STREAMSYNC_ID=your client id
STREAMSYNC_SECRET=your client secret

The environment variables do not need to be persistent, the credentials will be saved automatically and managed as necessary from now on.

Now it can be run like this `python -m streamsync <clip url> streamer1 streamer2 streamer3`
