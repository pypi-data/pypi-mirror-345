{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mine at position(40.5, -82.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- None (no structures have been built yet)\n\n### Iron Ore location at position(2.5, -73.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- None (no structures have been built yet)\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(4.0, -63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 4.0, -63.0) with current fuel of 16 coal and 25 iron plates available for smelting. The furnace currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n### Errors related to insufficient Automation Science Packs\n- Ensure you have enough Automation Science Packs in your inventory to research Automation technology. You need 10 but currently have 0. Craft the required items (copper-plate and iron-gear-wheel) to create Automation Science Packs.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. In this case, you need a stone furnace to place it at the specified location.\n- Check the recipe requirements for crafting entities to ensure you have the necessary materials available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to smelting timeout\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has both fuel and ingredients to smelt. Check the inventory for required inputs and ensure they are available before starting the smelting process. This error occurred due to insufficient iron ore in inventory.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient ingredients in the furnace\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. If the furnace is empty of ingredients, it will not be able to produce items.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient coal in inventory\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. Harvest coal as needed to maintain sufficient fuel levels.\n\n### Errors related to crafting unresearched items\n- Ensure that you have researched the necessary technology before attempting to craft items that require it. In this case, the assembling machine requires automation technology to be unlocked.\n\n### Errors related to research not completing within expected time\n- Monitor the research progress and ensure you have the necessary items to complete the research. If research is not completing, check for any missing ingredients or packs required for the research.\n\n### Errors related to failed crafting due to unresearched recipes\n- Ensure that you have researched the necessary technology before attempting to craft items that require it. For example, the assembling machine requires automation technology which is not unlocked yet.\n\n### Errors related to failed crafting due to missing items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to craft specific items. For example, you need at least 1 copper-plate to craft Automation Science Packs.\n\n### Errors related to placing entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory to place an entity. For instance, you cannot place an assembling machine if it is not present in your inventory.\n\n### Errors related to failed crafting of Assembling Machine\n- Ensure that you have researched the necessary technology before attempting to craft the assembling machine. The recipe for assembling machine is not unlocked yet as it requires automation technology.\n\n### Errors related to failed placement of Assembling Machine\n- Ensure you have the assembling machine in your inventory before attempting to place it. If it is not present, the placement will fail.\n\n### Errors related to incorrect API usage\n- Ensure that you are passing the correct types of arguments to functions. For example, when inspecting an inventory, make sure to pass an Entity or Position object rather than a Prototype object.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient materials to craft a Stone Furnace\n- Ensure you have gathered enough raw materials (in this case, stone) before attempting to craft a stone furnace. You need 2 stones to craft it, and you currently have only 3.\n\n### Errors related to crafting failure due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Ensure you have all required sub-ingredients for crafting. In this case, the stone furnace requires 2 stones, and you need to gather more stones before attempting to craft it again.\n\n### Errors related to incorrect entity reference in API calls\n- Ensure that you are passing the correct entity type when using functions like `insert_item`. For example, you should pass an Entity or EntityGroup instead of a Position object."}
