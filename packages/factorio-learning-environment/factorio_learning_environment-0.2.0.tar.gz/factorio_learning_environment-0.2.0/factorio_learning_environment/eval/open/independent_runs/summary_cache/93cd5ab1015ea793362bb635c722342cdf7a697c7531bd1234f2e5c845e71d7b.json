{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, y=-84.0) with output drop position at (40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, y=-80.5) with pickup position at (41.5, y=-79.5) and drop position at (41.5, y=-81.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, y=-83.5)\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, y=-49.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt'\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of materials between entities\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup at positions (50.5, y=-86.5) to (48.5, y=-86.5), (54.5, y=-86.5) to (52.5, y=-86.5), (44.5, y=-82.5) to (42.5, y=-82.5), (44.5, y=-83.5) to (44.5, y=-81.5), and (47.5, y=-82.5) to (49.5, y=-82.5)\n- Individual belts at positions (43.5, y=-84.5) to (45.5, y=-84.5) and (45.5, y=-85.5) to (47.5, y=-85.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Ensure there is a suitable and unoccupied position before attempting to place a wooden or iron chest.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect API arguments\n- Correctly use the API by ensuring all arguments are valid. For example, the `PickupEntity` function does not accept a `quantity` argument. Remove or correct this argument to avoid errors."}
