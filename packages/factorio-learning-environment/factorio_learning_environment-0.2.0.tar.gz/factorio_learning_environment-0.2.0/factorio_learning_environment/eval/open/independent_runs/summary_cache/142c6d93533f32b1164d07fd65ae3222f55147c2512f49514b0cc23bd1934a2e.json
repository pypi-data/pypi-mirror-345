Regularly check and replenish your coal supply to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Full Inventory Management\n- Regularly empty chests and other storage entities to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Specifically, ensure the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors in Item Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory. This will prevent errors such as \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\""}
