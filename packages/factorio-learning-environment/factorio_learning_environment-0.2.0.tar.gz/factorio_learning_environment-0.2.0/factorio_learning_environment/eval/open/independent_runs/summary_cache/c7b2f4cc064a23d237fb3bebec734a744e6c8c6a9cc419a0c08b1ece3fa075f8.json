{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Currently operational (299,930 crude oil remaining)\n- **Main Storage tank** at (21.5,41.5) - Stores crude oil (currently holding 51.2 crude oil)\n- **Remote Storage tank** at (15.5,35.5) - Additional storage (currently holding 15.0 crude oil)\n- Connected by underground PipeGroup (fluid_system=2380) for crude oil transport\n\n### Power Generation System at (26.5,42.0)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Provides water (currently operational)\n- **Boiler** at (26.5,42.0) - Critical fuel shortage (0/50 coal remaining)\n- **Steam engine** at (29.5,42.5) - Running at 87% capacity (11,800 power)\n- Connected by:\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=2373) for water transport\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=2385) for steam transport\n- Powered by electricity group (id=1142) with 6 small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical fuel management failures\n- Boiler completely depleted (0/50 coal) despite automated monitoring\n- Steam engine operating at reduced capacity (87%)\n- Solutions:\n  - Implement redundant fuel delivery system\n  - Increase minimum fuel threshold to 30 coal\n  - Create emergency fuel stockpile (300+ coal recommended)\n\n### Power system vulnerabilities\n- Single point of failure in power generation\n- No backup power sources\n- Solutions:\n  - Add secondary boiler/steam engine pair\n  - Implement power switch for emergency isolation\n  - Create dedicated coal supply line\n\n### Fluid network optimization\n- Water network (ID 2373) pressure fluctuations\n- Crude oil network (ID 2380) operating at 98% pressure\n- Steam network (ID 2385) temperature variations\n- Solutions:\n  - Add water buffer tanks\n  - Implement circuit-controlled flow regulation\n  - Monitor network IDs for performance tracking\n\n### Maintenance procedures\n- Current issues highlight need for:\n  1. Automated fuel delivery system\n  2. Power generation redundancy\n  3. Real-time monitoring dashboard\n  4. Scheduled maintenance calendar\n\n### Emergency protocols\n- All previous emergency recommendations still critical:\n  1. Maintain minimum 300 coal buffer\n  2. Document all network connections\n  3. Implement automated alerts\n  4. Create system isolation procedures\n\n### System documentation\n- Continue documenting:\n  1. All entity positions\n  2. Network IDs\n  3. Connection points\n  4. Performance baselines"}
