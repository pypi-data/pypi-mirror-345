{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Electricity Generator at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) (working, connected to pipe network)  \n- **Boiler** at (x=-7.0, y=0.5) (fueled with coal, outputting steam at x=-5.5, y=0.5)  \n- **Steam engine** at (x=-1.5, y=0.5) (unpowered, not connected to power network)  \n- **Pipe network** (fluid system 5563 for water, 5565 for steam)  \n  - Pipes connect boiler to steam engine, but steam engine input is not fully connected.  \n\n#### Oil Extraction and Processing Facility at position (x=17.5, y=40.5)  \n*(Unchanged from previous report, no updates in these steps.)*  \n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Fluid Connection Failures  \n- **Repeated refinery-to-chemical-plant connection errors** (Steps 73-74)  \n  - Ensure both refinery output (x=29.5, y=48.5) and chemical plant input (x=41.5, y=52.5) are unblocked.  \n- **Boiler-to-steam-engine pipe misalignment** (Step 77)  \n  - Reconnect boiler output (x=-5.5, y=0.5) to steam engine input (x=-4.0, y=0.5) with straight pipes.  \n\n#### Power Grid Issues  \n- **Steam engine unpowered despite steam supply** (Steps 75-76)  \n  - Place small electric pole near steam engine (x=-1.5, y=0.5) to link it to the power network.  \n\n#### Placement Errors  \n- **Small electric pole placement blocked** (Step 78)  \n  - Clear obstructions at (x=-2.0, y=0.0) before placing poles.  \n- **Boiler placement syntax error** (Step 79)  \n  - Correct `nearest_buildable` call: use keyword args (`prototype`, `box`, `center`).  \n\n#### API Misuse  \n- **Invalid starred expression in `connect_entities`** (Step 72)  \n  - Pass pipe waypoints as a list, not starred: `connect_entities(waypoints, ...)`.  \n\n#### New Issues in Steps 79  \n- **Offshore pump at (x=-9.5, y=1.5) not connected**  \n  - Link pump output (x=-8.5, y=1.5) to boiler input (x=-7.5, y=-1.5) with pipes.  \n\n---\n\n### NAMESPACE  \n*(No new functions defined by the agent in these steps.)*"}
