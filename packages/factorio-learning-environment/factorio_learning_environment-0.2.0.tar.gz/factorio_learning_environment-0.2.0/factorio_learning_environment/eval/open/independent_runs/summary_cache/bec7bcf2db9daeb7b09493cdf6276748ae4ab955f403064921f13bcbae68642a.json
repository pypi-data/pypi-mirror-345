{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) intended to transfer items between entities, currently not receiving electricity.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) currently out of fuel.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with no research in progress, requiring automation science packs.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including the inserter and steam engine, but currently not supplying power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Research Setup\n- Ensure that the `set_research` function is called with a valid technology to research. Verify that the technology name is correct and available for research.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the power connections and ensure that the inserter is connected to a functioning power network. Verify that the electricity generator is operational and supplying power.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to prevent power outages.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and receiving steam. Verify that all pipes are correctly placed and connected.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be significantly improved."}
