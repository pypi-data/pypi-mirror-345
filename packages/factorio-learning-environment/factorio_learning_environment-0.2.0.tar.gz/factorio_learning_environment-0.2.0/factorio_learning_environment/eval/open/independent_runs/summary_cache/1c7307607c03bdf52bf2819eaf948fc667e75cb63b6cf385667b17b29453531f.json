{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) with a fuel source of coal and currently working with iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) with a fuel source of coal and currently working with iron ore.\n\n### Inserter and Chest Setup at position (4.5, 1.5) and (6.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (4.5, 1.5) which is currently waiting for space in the destination due to output blockage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5) which is currently empty.\n\n### Belt Systems\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from position (-11.5, -50.5) to (-13.5, -50.5) and outputs from (-13.5, -50.5) to (-13.5, -52.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from position (-12.5, -50.5) to (-12.5, -52.5) and (-11.5, -49.5) to (-11.5, -51.5), and outputs from (-11.5, -52.5) to (-13.5, -52.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's drop position aligns with the intended receiving entity, such as a chest, to prevent misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Output Blockage\n- Make sure there is a sink entity available to receive the output from the inserter to avoid blockage. Consider repositioning or adding additional entities to handle the output effectively."}
