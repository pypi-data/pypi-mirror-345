{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Mining and Transport System at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -82.0): Extracts coal and outputs it to a transport belt.\n- **Transport belts**:\n  - Belt at (41.5, -80.5) -> (43.5, -80.5): Transports coal from the drill to the inserter.\n  - Belt at (43.5, -79.5) -> (43.5, -77.5): Transports coal from the inserter to the chest.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (43.5, -79.5): Moves coal from the transport belt to the chest.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (41.5, -79.5): Stores coal transported by the inserter.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target position for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity or blocked by water. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n  - Example: Failed to place a burner inserter next to the wooden chest at (41.5, -79.5) due to existing entities or obstructions.\n\n#### Errors when inspecting or interacting with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to interact with it.\n  - Example: Attempted to inspect the inventory of a wooden chest at (41.5, -79.5) that no longer existed.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in blocked or invalid positions\n- Clear obstructions (e.g., items on the ground) before placing entities. Ensure the target position is valid for placement.\n  - Example: Failed to place a burner inserter due to an item-on-ground blocking the position.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are blocked\n- Ensure transport belts connected to mining drills are clear and not blocked to allow continuous operation.\n  - Example: The burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) was blocked due to a blocked transport belt at (41.5, -80.5).\n\n#### Errors when interacting with entities that have been removed\n- Check if an entity still exists before attempting to interact with it, especially after removing or replacing entities.\n  - Example: Attempted to interact with a burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) that had been removed.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Avoid placing entities in positions already occupied by other entities. Use proper spacing or adjust the reference position.\n  - Example: Failed to place a burner inserter at (43.5, -79.5) because another inserter already existed there."}
