{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures created on the map. The execution logs indicate that the agent attempted to place several entities, but none were successfully placed due to errors. As a result, there are no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place a Wooden Chest at various positions**: Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placing a Wooden Chest. Check for any obstructions or restrictions in the environment that may prevent placement.\n  - Positions attempted: (30.0, 30.0), (40.5, -82.5), (50.0, -90.0), (0.0, 0.0), (100.0, -150.0).\n\n- **Cannot place a Transport Belt at various positions**: Verify that the path for the Transport Belt is clear and that the belt can be placed without interference from other entities or terrain features.\n  - Positions attempted: (45.0, -85.0), (65.0, -105.0).\n\n- **Cannot place a Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)**: Make sure the area intended for the Stone Furnace is free of obstacles and is a valid location for placement.\n\nTo mitigate these errors, always check the environment for any restrictions or existing entities that may block placement. Consider using a tool or command to preview the placement area before executing the placement action."}
