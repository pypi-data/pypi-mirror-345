{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the boiler to the steam engine with pipes running through positions such as (-5.5, 16.5), (-4.5, 16.5), (-3.5, 16.5), and others.\n- **PipeGroup** for water supply from the offshore pump, with pipes at positions like (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), etc.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting a steam engine requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and pipes. Make sure these are available or can be crafted.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that it is available in your inventory. Attempting to place a small electric pole without having it in inventory will result in failure.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- When connecting entities such as pipes, ensure that you have the required items in your inventory to complete the connection. For example, connecting a boiler to a steam engine requires pipes in your inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel for entities like boilers and furnaces to maintain operations. Ensure coal or other fuel types are available and inserted into these entities.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Sub-Ingredients\n- When crafting complex items, verify that all sub-ingredients can be crafted or are available. For example, crafting iron gear wheels requires iron plates, which need to be smelted in a furnace. Ensure the smelting process is operational and ingredients are available."}
