Check if the necessary resources can be crafted with the available machines. In this case, iron-plate needs to be smelted in a furnace before crafting iron-chests.\n- Check the status of the furnace to ensure it has fuel and is actively smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo new functions have been defined.\n```"}
