{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with iron ore as input and iron plates as output.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (3.0, 0.0) with copper ore as input and copper plates as output.\n\n### Electric Furnace at position (0.5, 3.5)\nConsists of an electric furnace at position (0.5, 3.5) with power connection to ElectricityGroup(id=38395) and iron plates as input.\n\n### Power Generation Structure at position (5.5, 3.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position (5.5, 3.0), a steam engine at position (9.5, 3.5), and a PipeGroup connecting the boiler to the steam engine. The boiler is connected to the steam engine through a series of pipes.\n\n### Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when checking research progress when no research is in progress\n  - Ensure that research is started before checking progress.\n- Errors when setting research to a technology that is already researched\n  - Check if a technology is already researched before attempting to set it as the current research.\n- Errors when crafting items that require a crafting machine or furnace\n  - Ensure that the required crafting machine or furnace is available and properly set up before attempting to craft items.\n- Errors when using incorrect keyword arguments in API calls\n  - Check the API documentation to ensure that the correct keyword arguments are being used. For example, the `extract_item` function does not have a `position` keyword argument.\n- Errors when crafting items without sufficient ingredients\n  - Ensure that all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items.\n- Errors when attempting to access an entity that does not exist\n  - Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. For example, the error in Step 22 occurred because there was no electric furnace at position (0, 3).\n- Errors when attempting to access a steam engine that does not exist\n  - Ensure that a steam engine exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. For example, the error in Step 23 occurred because there was no steam engine at position (10, 10).\n- Errors when placing a steam engine at a position that is occupied by another entity\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a steam engine. For example, the error in Step 28 occurred because there was an existing object in the way.\n- Errors when placing a steam engine at a position that is not valid (e.g. water or unplaceable terrain)\n  - Ensure that the target position is valid for placing a steam engine. For example, the error in Step 29 occurred because the target position was water or unplaceable terrain.\n- Errors when attempting to access an offshore pump that does not exist\n  - Ensure that an offshore pump exists before attempting to access it. For example, the error in Step 32 occurred because there was no offshore pump found.\n- Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before using them. For example, the error in Step 38 occurred because the variable 'f' was not defined.\n- Errors when placing an offshore pump next to a boiler with insufficient spacing\n  - Ensure that there is sufficient spacing between the offshore pump and the boiler. For example, the error in Step 40 occurred because a small-electric-pole already existed at the new position.\n- Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n  - Ensure that there are no obstructions between the entities and that the target entity is able to receive the fluid from the source entity. For example, the error in Step 43 occurred because there were no valid connections between the offshore pump and the boiler.\n- Errors when manually placing pipes between entities\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a pipe. For example, the error in Step 45 occurred because there was an existing object in the way.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
