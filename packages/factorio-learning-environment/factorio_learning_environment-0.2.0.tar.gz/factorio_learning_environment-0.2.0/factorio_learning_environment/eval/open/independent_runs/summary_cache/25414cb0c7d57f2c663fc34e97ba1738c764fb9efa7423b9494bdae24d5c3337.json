{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (39,999 units)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Cannot Place Wooden Chest or Burner Inserter at Desired Location**: Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Check for any existing entities or obstacles that may be blocking the placement.\n\n### Errors when Moving Entities\n- **Cannot Move Stone Furnace to Desired Location**: Verify that the target position is valid and unoccupied. Ensure there is enough space for the entity to be moved.\n\n### Errors in Retrieving Entities\n- **Could Not Get Prototype at Specified Position**: Double-check the position coordinates and ensure the entity exists at the specified location before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors in Function Calls\n- **Unexpected Keyword Argument 'quantity' in PickupEntity**: Review the function signature for `pickup_entity` and ensure that all arguments are correctly specified without any unexpected keywords.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the map for any stale or outdated entity data to ensure accurate operations.\n- Address warnings such as \"output blocked by item on the ground\" by ensuring there is a sink entity to accept outputs from drills or other production entities."}
