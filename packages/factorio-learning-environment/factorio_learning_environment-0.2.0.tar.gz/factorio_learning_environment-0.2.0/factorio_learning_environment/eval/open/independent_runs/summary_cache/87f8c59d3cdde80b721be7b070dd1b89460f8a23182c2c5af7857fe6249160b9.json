{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 25.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine. Key positions include:\n  - Pipe at (-8.5, 23.5)\n  - Underground pipe start at (-7.5, 23.5)\n  - Various pipes and pipe groups connecting the system\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) connected to a power network\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) for input storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5) for output storage\n- Electricity network with poles connecting inserters and other entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure that the target position for placing a pipe is clear of any existing entities. If an entity exists, remove it before attempting to place a new pipe.\n- Verify that the terrain is suitable for placing pipes, especially underground pipes, as certain terrains like water can block placement.\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure that you have the necessary inventory items, such as pipe-to-ground, before attempting to reconnect pipes.\n- Adjust the strategy if the initial placement of pipes does not work due to terrain or other obstacles.\n\n### Boiler Not Connected\n- Check the connection between the offshore pump, pipes, and the boiler to ensure that there is a continuous path for water to flow.\n- Verify that the boiler has a sufficient supply of fuel and is correctly connected to the steam engine.\n\n### Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly connected to the power network and that the power network is active.\n- Check the input supply for inserters to ensure they have items to move.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly extract items from the furnace to prevent it from becoming full and halting production."}
