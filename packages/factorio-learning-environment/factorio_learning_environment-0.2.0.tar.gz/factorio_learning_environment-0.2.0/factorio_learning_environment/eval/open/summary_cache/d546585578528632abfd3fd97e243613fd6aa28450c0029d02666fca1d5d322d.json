{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n\nThis structure is designed to extract iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and store the plates for further use.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters adjacent to other entities\n- When placing an inserter next to a furnace or chest, ensure the target tile is free and not occupied by another entity. In step 1, the burner inserter could not be placed next to the furnace because a wooden chest occupied the intended tile.\n- To avoid this, increase spacing, change the direction of placement, or adjust the reference position to find a free adjacent tile.\n\n### Errors placing wooden chests on occupied tiles\n- Attempts to place a wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) failed because the tile was already occupied.\n- Before placing a chest, verify the tile is free of any existing entities or objects.\n- Consider searching for nearby free tiles if the target position is blocked.\n\n### Fuel management errors causing entity stoppage\n- Several entities (burner mining drill, furnace, inserters) experienced \"out of fuel\" or \"no fuel\" status, halting their operation.\n- Ensure continuous insertion of fuel (e.g., coal) into all burner-type entities to maintain operation.\n- Automate fuel supply or monitor fuel levels to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items or destination space\n- Inserters showed statuses such as \"waiting for source items\" or \"waiting for space in destination,\" indicating supply or storage bottlenecks.\n- Verify that source inventories have sufficient items and destination inventories have available space.\n- Manage throughput and storage capacity to maintain smooth item flow.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
