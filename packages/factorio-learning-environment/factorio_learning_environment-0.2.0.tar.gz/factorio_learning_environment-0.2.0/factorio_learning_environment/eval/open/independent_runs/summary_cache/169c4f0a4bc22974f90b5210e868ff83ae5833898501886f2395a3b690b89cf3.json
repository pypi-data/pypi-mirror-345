{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 48-55)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) connected to pipe at (-8.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 3.5) with fuel inventory (29/50 coal)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 3.5) producing 13,500 kW\n- Connected pipe network (water system ID 1115, steam system ID 1117)\n- Coal buffer system:\n  - Wooden chest at (-7.5, 7.5) containing 200 coal\n  - Burner inserter at (-6.5, 7.5) (fueled with 9 coal, operational)\n\n### Oil Extraction and Storage System at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) working at 100% efficiency (299,830 crude oil remaining)\n- Storage tanks at:\n  - (22.5, 40.5) containing 108.15 crude oil\n  - (27.5, 40.5) containing 67.25 crude oil\n  - (32.5, 40.5) containing 37.76 crude oil\n  - (37.5, 40.5) containing 12.28 crude oil (new addition)\n- Connected pipe network (crude oil system ID 1118) spanning 18.5,38.5 to 35.5,41.5\n- Power network (ID 6100) with 468 small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Pumpjack Placement Errors\n- Attempted placements at (19.0,47.0), (19.0,49.0), (19.0,44.5) failed due to:\n  - Water obstructions - verify terrain is land before placement\n  - Distance limitations - move within 10 tiles before placing\n  - Resource verification - confirm crude oil patch exists at location\n\n### Resource Scanning Errors\n- Failed to find crude oil at (7.5,30.5) - verify resource existence before scanning\n\n### System Optimization\n- Implement automated fuel monitoring for boiler (-7.0,3.5)\n- Add secondary water pipeline redundancy at (-8.5,-0.5)\n- Establish backup power connections for pumpjack (17.5,40.5)\n\n### Maintenance Procedures\n- Scheduled inspections every 4 hours for critical systems\n- Implement fuel reserve monitoring\n- Create emergency drill schedules\n\n### Expansion Planning\n- Verify all placement locations meet:\n  - Terrain requirements (land only)\n  - Resource availability\n  - Proper spacing constraints\n  - Power network coverage"}
