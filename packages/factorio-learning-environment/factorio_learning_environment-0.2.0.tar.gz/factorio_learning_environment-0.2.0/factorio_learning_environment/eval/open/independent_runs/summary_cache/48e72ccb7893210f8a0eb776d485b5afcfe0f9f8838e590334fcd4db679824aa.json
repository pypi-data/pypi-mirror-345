Check the supply chain to ensure continuous flow of materials to the inserters.\n\n### Errors related to furnace output being full\n- Regularly monitor and clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Consider using inserters to automatically move items from the furnace output to a storage chest or conveyor belt.\n\n### Errors when using transport belts\n- Verify the direction and connectivity of transport belts to ensure they are correctly configured to move items between entities."}
