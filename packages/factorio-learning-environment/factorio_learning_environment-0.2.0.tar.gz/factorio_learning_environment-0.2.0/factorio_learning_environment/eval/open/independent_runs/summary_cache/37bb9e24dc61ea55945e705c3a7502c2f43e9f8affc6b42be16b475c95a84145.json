{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the burner mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. Note: The inserter's pickup position is misaligned with the chest.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues with the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position to facilitate the transfer of items. Misalignment causes the inserter to fail in picking up items from the chest.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Always check your inventory for sufficient fuel (coal) before attempting to refuel entities such as inserters and mining drills. Lack of coal in the inventory will result in refueling failures.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly positioned to drop items into the furnace. Misalignment will prevent the furnace from receiving the necessary ingredients to function.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency of the iron ore processing facility can be significantly improved."}
