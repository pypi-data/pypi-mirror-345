{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by a network of pipes and small electric poles\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) for coal storage\n- Additional Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) for overflow storage\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -80.5) for moving coal\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Iron Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal\n- Iron Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) containing coal\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Science Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs for coal transportation\n- Various belts connecting different parts of the facility\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Repeated Errors in Establishing Electricity Connections\n- Ensure that the electricity network is properly set up and connected to all necessary components. Verify that all poles and connections are correctly placed and linked.\n\n### Warnings of Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are used for storing mined resources to prevent overflow and halt in production.\n\n### Boiler Fuel Warnings\n- Keep the boiler consistently refueled to maintain continuous power generation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as needed.\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that there is a continuous supply of steam. Check for any disconnected pipes or missing connections.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary ingredients to maintain production. Verify that inserters and belts are correctly positioned to deliver resources to the furnace."}
