This will prevent errors like \"Could not extract\" from occurring.\n\n### Errors when Transferring Items to Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients and space for the items being transferred. This will help avoid errors such as \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n### Naming Errors\n- Define all variables and storage names before using them in operations to avoid errors like \"name 'new_coal_storage_2' is not defined.\"\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage warnings.\n\n### Consistent Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage inventory levels to ensure smooth operation and avoid running out of necessary resources."}
