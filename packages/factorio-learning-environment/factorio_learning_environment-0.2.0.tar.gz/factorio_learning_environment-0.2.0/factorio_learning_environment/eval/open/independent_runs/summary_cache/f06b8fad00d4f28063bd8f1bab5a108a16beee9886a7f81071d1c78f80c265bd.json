{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup (Partial)\n*   Consists of an Offshore Pump at `Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5)` connected via pipes (`PipeGroup` starting at `x=-8.5 y=-0.5`) to a Boiler at `Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5)`. The boiler currently has no fuel.\n*   A Steam Engine is placed at `Position(x=0.5, y=6.5)`. An attempt to connect the boiler output to the steam engine input via pipes failed (Step 110). The steam engine has no fluid input and is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\n*   Consists of an Electric Mining Drill at `Position(x=17.5, y=1.5)` (currently without power)."}
