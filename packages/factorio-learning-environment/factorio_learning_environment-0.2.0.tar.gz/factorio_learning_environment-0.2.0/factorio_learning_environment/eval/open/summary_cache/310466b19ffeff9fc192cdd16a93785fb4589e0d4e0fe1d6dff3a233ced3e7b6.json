{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore, with frequent coal insertion maintaining operation.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage and input/output buffers for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, transferring items between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (17.5, 72.5) placed to improve power connectivity.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt remains unresolved, causing mining drill to wait for space.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage with improved power coverage and inserter fueling, though output congestion persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), recently refueled but now out of fuel and non-operational.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles at (0.5, 6.5), (0.5, 3.5), (-4.5, -0.5), and newly placed poles near boiler and steam engine, forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure generates electricity from steam power but requires refueling of the boiler to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power network via small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates to assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5) placed to improve power connectivity.\n- Despite repeated insertion of iron plates into assembler input chest and assembler itself, assembling machine reports ingredient shortage and no output is extracted, indicating a possible recipe or inventory handling issue.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production with power and inserter setup in place but experiencing persistent crafting and output extraction problems.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt causing mining drill stoppage\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked due to full furnace output belt.\n- To resolve, extend or clear output belts and chests downstream to accept smelted iron plates.\n- Ensure inserters and chests connected to furnace output have sufficient capacity and are not full.\n\n### Boiler fuel management and operational continuity\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) was refueled but is now out of fuel and non-operational.\n- Maintain a steady supply of coal to the boiler to prevent power generation interruptions.\n- Consider adding inserters or logistics to automate fuel supply to boiler.\n\n### Assembling machine input and output inventory management\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) repeatedly shows empty input and output inventories despite iron plates being inserted into input chest and assembler.\n- Assembler reports missing iron plates as ingredient shortage, suggesting possible mismatch in recipe or incorrect insertion method.\n- Verify the assembler\u2019s recipe matches the input materials and that iron plates are correctly inserted into the assembler\u2019s input inventory, not just the input chest.\n- Extract assembled items regularly from output chest to prevent output inventory blocking.\n- Monitor inserters feeding the assembler and output chest to ensure they are operational and not waiting for source or destination items.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts and tile occupancy\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near (18.0, 75.0) failed due to collisions with mining drill or water tiles.\n- Always check tile occupancy and surroundings before placement.\n- Adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions to find valid placement tiles.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) remain fueled and operational.\n- Continue monitoring fuel levels to prevent stoppages.\n- Ensure inser"}
