The produced iron plates are needed as a resource for Lab crafting and subsequent research operations.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\nConsists of a single furnace entity used to smelt copper ore into copper plates. These copper plates are further processed into copper cables and electronic components required in the Lab crafting recipe.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. using \u2018radius\u2019 when the function does not support it).\n\u2003\u2013 Do not supply extra positional arguments to functions like get_entities; verify the function signature before use.\n\n\u2022 Placement and inventory validation errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required item (e.g. Lab) is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that an entity is available for placement to prevent errors when the inventory lacks the necessary item.\n\n\u2022 Handling NoneType returns:\n\u2003\u2013 When retrieving entities, check that the result is not None before iterating; use a fallback (such as an empty list) to avoid \u201cNoneType object is not iterable\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Resource chain and sub-ingredient shortages:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that all prerequisite resources and sub-components (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are sufficiently available before starting complex crafting.\n\u2003\u2013 Plan resource production to cover cascading requirements and avoid repeated crafting failures."}
