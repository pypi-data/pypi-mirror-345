Multiple attempts were made to locate, craft, and place a Lab here. However, due to resource shortages and missing inventory items, the Lab was never successfully created on the map.\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nAn existing furnace was retrieved and used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Resources (iron ore and coal) were inserted and processed to boost the overall iron plate count, supporting subsequent production steps.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\nA copper furnace was identified and utilized for processing copper ore into copper plates. In this setup, 50 units of copper ore were smelted, yielding 45 copper plates to help alleviate resource constraints for further crafting.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n  \u2013 Do not pass unsupported parameters: The get_entities function was incorrectly invoked using a keyword argument ('radius') and later with extra positional arguments. Always review the function signature and use only allowed parameters.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Verification\n  \u2013 Confirm that the required entity (e.g. Lab) is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  \u2013 Verify that the result from entity queries is valid (i.e. not None) before iterating over it to avoid type errors.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Chain and Resource Management\n  \u2013 Ensure that all sub-ingredients needed for complex crafts (such as Lab crafting, which requires items like iron-gear-wheels and electronic circuits) are available through established production chains.\n  \u2013 Double-check recipe requirements and confirm that necessary intermediate production (smelting and assembly) is set up prior to initiating a craft."}
