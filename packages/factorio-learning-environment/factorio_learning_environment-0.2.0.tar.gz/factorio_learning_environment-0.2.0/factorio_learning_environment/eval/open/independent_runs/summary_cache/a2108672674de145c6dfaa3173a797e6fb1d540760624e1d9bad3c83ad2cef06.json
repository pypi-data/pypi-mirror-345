{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone mine at position(-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position: -46.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position: -45.5, 1.5) to collect stone\n- Burner inserter (position: -46.5, 1.5) to feed stone into furnace\n- Stone furnace (position: -44.0, 2.0) to smelt stone into stone bricks\n- Wooden chest (position: -46.5, 2.5) to collect output from inserter\n- Transport belt (position: -45.5, 2.5) to transport stone from chest to furnace\n- Burner inserter (position: -43.5, 0.5) to input stones into furnace\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when attempting to connect transport belts directly to entities that are not transport belts\n  - Ensure that transport belts are connected to other transport belts or to inserters that input or output items from the belt.\n* Errors when attempting to place entities at positions that are already occupied\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n* Errors when attempting to place entities too close to other entities\n  - Ensure that there is sufficient spacing between entities to accommodate the new entity.\n* Errors when chest is full\n  - Ensure that the chest is emptied before continuing to mine or produce items. The chest at (-45.5, 1.5) is full and needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n* Errors when entities are out of fuel\n  - Ensure that entities that require fuel have sufficient fuel to operate. The burner mining drill and burner inserter have been fueled with coal.\n* Errors when output is blocked\n  - Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output. The furnace is not receiving ingredients to smelt because the inserter is waiting for source items.\n* Errors when attempting to extract items that are not present in a chest\n  - Ensure that the required items are present in the chest before attempting to extract them.\n* Errors when placing entities too far away from the current position\n  - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before using them in the code. Check for typos and undefined names.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `drill`: likely an entity object representing the burner mining drill (type not explicitly mentioned)\n  - `chest`: likely an entity object representing the wooden chest (type not explicitly mentioned)\n  - `inserter`: likely an entity object representing the burner inserter (type not explicitly mentioned)\n  - `belt`: likely an entity object representing the transport belt (type not explicitly mentioned)\n* Utility functions:\n  - `place_entity(entity: Any, direction: Any, position: Any, exact: Any) -> Any`: Places an entity at a specified position.\n    - Failure mode: Could not place entity at target position due to being too far away or the position being occupied by another entity.\n    - Success mode: Entity is placed successfully at the target position.\n  - `get_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any`: Likely retrieves an entity at a specified position (not explicitly defined but mentioned in error message).\n  - `extract_item(item: Any, chest: Any, quantity: Any) -> Any`: Extracts a specified quantity of an item from a chest.\n    - Failure mode: Could not extract item from chest because it was not present in the chest.\n    - Success mode: Item is extracted successfully from the chest.\n  - `connect_entities(source: Any, target: Any, entity_type: Any) -> Any`: Connects entities using a specified entity type (e.g., transport belt).\n    - Failure mode: Could not connect entities directly due to incompatible entity types.\n    - Success mode: Entities are connected successfully using the specified entity type."}
