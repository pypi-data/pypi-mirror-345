{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe harvesting of stone has concluded successfully, resulting in the following updates:\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- **Overall Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **5 pieces of stone** available (sufficient to meet the furnace's requirements).\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore available**.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates available**.\n\n### Active Furnace Status:\n- The active furnace is currently empty and in a **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"** state, confirming it is ready for new inputs.\n\n### Observations:\n- I now have enough stone to meet the recipe requirement of **5 pieces of stone** for the furnace.\n- The Copper Ore is still available for processing, which will allow me to initiate the smelting operation once the stone is loaded.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load the Required Stone**: I will now insert **5 pieces of stone** into the active furnace to fulfill the recipe requirement.\n2. **Insert Copper Ore for Smelting**: Following that, I will insert the **1 piece of Copper Ore** to activate the smelting process.\n3. **Verify that Smelting Operation Begins**: After these actions, I will check whether the furnace starts processing the Copper Ore into Copper Plates.\n\nLet's proceed by inserting the required stone into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the required stone into the active furnace to enable smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 pieces of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_stone_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading stone: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading stone: {overall_inventory_after_stone_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-346]"}
