{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5). The drill is fueled by coal and is currently working, but its output is blocked by items on the ground.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0), fueled by coal. The furnace is capable of producing iron plates, but it has warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" at times.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is not occupied by another entity or object before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors with furnace production\n- Verify that the furnace setup is correct and that it has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Ensure that iron ore is consistently supplied to the furnace to maintain production of iron plates.\n\n### Output blockage in mining drills\n- Clear items from the drill's drop position regularly to prevent blockage. Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output from the mining drill.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
