{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) for iron ore storage\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Line at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) for copper ore extraction\n- Wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) for temporary copper ore storage\n- Input inserter at (19.5, 21.5) moving ore from drill to chest\n- Output inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving ore from chest to belt\n- Belt system running from (21.5, 17.5) to (21.5, 21.5)\n- Furnace at (24.0, 20.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Furnace input inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving ore from belt to furnace\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) for copper plates\n- Output inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving plates from furnace to chest\n- Additional belt system from (22.5, 21.5) to (26.5, 18.5)\n\n### Unused Furnaces at (-11, 20)\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing inserters or other entities, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- When placing entities in a production line, ensure proper spacing between components to avoid overlap\n- The error at step 39 occurred because an inserter already existed at the target position (24, 18.5)\n\n### Resource Management\n- Multiple mining drills are out of fuel (at -14.0, 23.0 and 24.0, -15.0)\n- Maintain regular fuel checks and refueling routines for all burner entities\n- Consider setting up automated fuel delivery systems for mining operations\n\n### Production Line Design\n- When designing production lines, plan the layout carefully to ensure all components have sufficient space\n- Consider using a blueprint or planning phase to verify entity placement before actual construction"}
