Validate the existence and working status of the PipeGroup before attempting a connection, and use the operational fluid_system ID (e.g., 19028) consistently.\n\u2022 Pipeline Stabilization Efficiency:\n   - Fixed delay intervals (10-second waits) cause inefficiencies. Implement dynamic status checks to confirm pipeline stabilization before proceeding with further connection attempts."}
