{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -25.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected and has no energy.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Iron plate mine at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) that is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) that is currently not receiving electricity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to offshore pump\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly placed and that there is a clear path for the connection. Check the positions of the boiler and offshore pump to confirm they are within range.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Verify that all electrical connections are properly established and that the entities requiring power are linked to a power source. Check for any missing connections or broken links in the electricity network."}
