{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), which extracts iron ore and deposits it into nearby chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), which transfers iron ore from the chests to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (-12.0, -48.0), which smelts iron ore into iron plates. It currently has a full output of iron plates and is awaiting space for more production.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (-10.0, -48.0), which is currently inactive due to a lack of ingredients.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), and (-5.5, -48.5) for storing produced iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nThis system is designed to store iron plates produced by the furnaces. It includes:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), and (-5.5, -48.5) with varying amounts of stored iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5), which is responsible for transferring iron plates between storage chests but is currently waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\nThis system facilitates the movement of iron ore from mining to processing:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), which moves iron ore from the storage chests to the furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for temporary storage of iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity contains items before the inserter attempts to pick them up. Regularly check and maintain the supply of items to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Furnace Output Blockage\n- Regularly extract items from furnaces to prevent output blockage. Ensure there is sufficient storage space available to accommodate the output from the furnaces.\n\n### Low Fuel in Burner Mining Drill\n- Regularly monitor and refuel the burner mining drill to maintain continuous operation. Consider increasing the frequency of fuel checks or automating the refueling process to prevent downtime.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to receive items from the inserter. Regularly clear out destination entities to maintain a smooth flow of items.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients for smelting. Regularly check and maintain the supply chain to prevent idle furnaces."}
