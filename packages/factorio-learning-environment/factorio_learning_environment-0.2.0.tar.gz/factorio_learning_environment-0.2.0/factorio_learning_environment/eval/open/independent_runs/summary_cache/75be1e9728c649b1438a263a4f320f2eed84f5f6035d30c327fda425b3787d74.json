{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5). It is currently out of fuel and its chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) containing 112 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-51.5), out of fuel, waiting for source items.\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5), fueled with coal, waiting for source items.\n  - At position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), out of fuel, waiting for source items.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserters and the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt and its result inventory is full with 100 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=0.5, y=-1.5), fueled with coal, waiting for source items.\n  - At position (x=-1.5, y=0.5), out of fuel, waiting for source items.\n\n### Belt Group\n- Connects the iron ore mining facility to the smelting facility with 75 belts, facilitating the movement of materials between these structures.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure that the path for connecting transport belts is valid and not obstructed by other entities or terrain. The connection attempt between burner-inserters at (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=0.5, y=-1.5) failed due to an invalid path.\n\n### Attribute and Name Errors in Code\n- Ensure that the correct module or class is imported and used. The error \"AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'BurnerMiningDrill'\" suggests that the entity type is being incorrectly accessed. Verify that the entity is being referenced correctly.\n- The error \"NameError: name 'BurnerMiningDrill' is not defined\" indicates a missing import or incorrect reference. Ensure that the correct class or module is imported and used in the code.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like burner mining drills and burner inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Tracks the current inventory of resources like wood, stone, iron ore, and iron plates.\n  - `entities_on_map: List[Entity]` - Represents the entities present on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
