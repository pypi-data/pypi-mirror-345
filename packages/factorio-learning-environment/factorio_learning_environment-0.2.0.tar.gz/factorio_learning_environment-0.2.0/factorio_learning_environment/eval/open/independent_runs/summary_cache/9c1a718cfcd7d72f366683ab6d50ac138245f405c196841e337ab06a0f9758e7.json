{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), currently working but unable to continue due to a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) is storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). These furnaces are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnaces at (-15.0, -48.0) and (-13.0, -48.0) are working, while the furnace at (-11.0, -48.0) lacks ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Chest Blocking Mining Operations\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position (4.5, -58.5) is regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting.\n\n### Lack of Ingredients for Smelting\n- Continuously supply iron ore to the furnaces to maintain smelting operations. Ensure that the furnaces have a consistent input of raw materials.\n\n### Coal Insertion Error\n- Before attempting to insert coal into a burner mining drill, verify that there is sufficient coal in the inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the inventory lacks the required quantity of the item.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drill`: Represents the burner mining drill entity.\n- `furnace`: Represents the stone furnace entity.\n- `chest`: Represents the wooden chest entity."}
