{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Inserter Setup is Incorrect\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (e.g., chest) to the target (e.g., furnace). Regularly check and adjust the inserter setup to ensure it is functioning as intended.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to use them in actions. For example, ensure you have coal available before trying to insert it into an inserter or other entities.\n\n### Errors when Furnace is Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly configured to supply the furnace with the necessary ingredients. Regularly monitor the furnace's input to confirm it is receiving materials for processing."}
