Earlier failures involved fluid_system identifiers [138323, 138407, 138489, 138573, 138655, 138739, 138821, 138905] and [138987, 139071, 139153, 139237, 139319, 139403, 139485, 139569]. Subsequent attempts targeted fluid_system IDs [139651, 139735, 139817, 139901, 139983, 140067, 140149, 140233] while the latest attempts used [140315, 140399, 140481, 140565, 140647, 140731, 140813, 140897], all returning no candidate pipe groups.\n  - Tip: Ensure that candidate pipe groups exist within the 15-tile search radius and that fluid_system identifiers correctly match available pipeline components. Adjust configuration or search parameters as needed."}
