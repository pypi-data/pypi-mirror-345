{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore and Coal Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=54.5, y=-78.5) storing coal.\n- Target Wooden Chest at position (x=-10.5, y=-49.5) used for transferring and accumulating both coal and iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) producing iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that the inventory of the stone furnace is not full before attempting to insert items. The stone furnace at position (x=-14, y=-49) repeatedly failed to accept additional coal because its inventory was full. Consider removing some items from the furnace or using multiple furnaces to distribute the load.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked during these steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `iron_ore_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron ore in the chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n  - `coal_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal in the chest at position (x=54.5, y=-78.5).\n  - `target_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the combined inventory of coal and iron ore in the target chest at position (x=-10.5, y=-49.5).\n  - `stone_furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron plates in the stone furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)."}
