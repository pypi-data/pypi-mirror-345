{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) connected to pipe at (-8.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 3.5) with fuel inventory (35 coal)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 3.5) producing 13500.0 kW\n- Connected pipe network from (-8.5, -0.5) to (-5.5, 3.5)\n- Power network with poles including at (0.5, 6.5) and (-2.5, 5.5)\n- Coal buffer system:\n  - Wooden chest at (-7.5, 7.5) containing 200 coal\n  - Burner inserter at (-6.5, 7.5) (needs fuel)\n\n### Oil Extraction and Storage System at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) working at 100% efficiency\n- Storage tanks at:\n  - (22.5, 40.5) containing 25.96 crude oil\n  - (27.5, 40.5) containing 3.11 crude oil \n  - (32.5, 40.5) containing 0.32 crude oil\n  - (37.5, 40.5)\n  - (42.5, 40.5)\n- Connected pipe network spanning from (18.5, 38.5) to (30.5, 41.5)\n- Power network with poles including at (15.5, 39.5) and (32.5, 45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel management errors\n- Monitor boiler fuel levels proactively (caused power outage when fuel depleted)\n- Ensure burner inserters have fuel to operate (current inserter at (-6.5,7.5) is out of fuel)\n- Establish automated fuel delivery before critical levels are reached\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Verify clear space before placing entities (occurred when placing chest near boiler)\n- Check for existing entities before placement (wooden chest placement collision)\n- Consider alternative placement locations when initial attempt fails\n\n### Power system monitoring\n- Implement fuel level alerts before critical levels\n- Establish redundant power sources to prevent complete shutdowns\n- Monitor power consumption vs production capacity\n\n### Production optimization\n- Expand storage capacity or connect to processing facilities\n- Consider adding more pumpjacks at identified locations (20.5,40.5) and (23.5,40.5)\n- Implement proper fluid measurement methods (storage tanks don't have 'contents' attribute)\n\n### API usage\n- The nearest() function doesn't accept 'position' keyword argument\n- Storage tanks require proper fluid measurement methods\n- Import required modules before use (datetime not defined error)"}
