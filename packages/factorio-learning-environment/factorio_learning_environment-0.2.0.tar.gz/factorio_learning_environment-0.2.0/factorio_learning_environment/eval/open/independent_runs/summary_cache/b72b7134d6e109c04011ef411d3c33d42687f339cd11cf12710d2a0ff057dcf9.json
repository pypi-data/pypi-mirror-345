{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for iron ore extraction.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Processing Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for coal extraction.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) for processing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring coal from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to insert it into a furnace or drill.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is not occupied by another entity. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of your drills and inserters to ensure they are operational. Refuel them as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory of chests connected to your drills. Empty them regularly to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\nBy addressing these errors, you can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your operations in the game."}
