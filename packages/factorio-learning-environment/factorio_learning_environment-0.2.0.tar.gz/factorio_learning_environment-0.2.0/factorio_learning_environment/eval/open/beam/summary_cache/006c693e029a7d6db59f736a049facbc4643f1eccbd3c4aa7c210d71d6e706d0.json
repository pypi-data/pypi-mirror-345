{"content": "# The crafting was successful! I now have 1 Wooden Chest in my inventory, and I have 18 wood units remaining.\n# This is a positive outcome, as I have created a storage solution that will allow me to manage my resources more effectively.\n\n### Summary of Actions and Outcomes:\n1. **Initial Inventory Check**: Found that both inventory and entities were empty.\n2. **Resource Gathering**: Successfully harvested 20 units of wood.\n3. **Crafting Attempt**: Encountered an error due to an undefined function `ensure_craftable()`.\n4. **Corrected Crafting Process**: Retrieved the crafting recipe, checked inventory, and successfully crafted 1 Wooden Chest.\n\n### Tips and Successful Patterns:\n- **Check Inventory Before Crafting**: Always inspect your inventory before attempting to craft items to ensure you have the necessary resources.\n- **Error Handling**: Use assertions to check conditions (like resource availability) before proceeding with actions that depend on those conditions.\n- **Direct Function Calls**: If a function is not defined, look for alternative methods to achieve the same goal. In this case, checking the recipe and crafting directly worked well.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- Now that I have a Wooden Chest, I can store my resources in it. \n- I should consider gathering more resources, such as stone or iron, to expand my capabilities further.\n- I might also want to explore the environment for more entities or resources that can aid in my progress.\n\nLet's proceed to gather some stone next! I will find the nearest stone resource, move to it, and harvest some stone. \n\nstone_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nmove_to(stone_position)\nharvest_resource(stone_position, quantity=20, radius=10)  # Harvesting 20 stone units.\n\nprint(f\"Inventory after gathering stone: {inspect_inventory()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-8]"}
