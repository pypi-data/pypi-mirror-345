{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-42.5, -125.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-50.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 10.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-5.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including the Steam Engine and Inserter.\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input for Automation Science Pack, currently not in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check the positions and ensure there are no gaps or misalignments.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, verify that the required items are present in your inventory. For example, ensure coal is available before attempting to refuel or insert into a burner mining drill, and ensure automation science packs are available before inserting into a lab.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Verify that all entities requiring power, such as inserters, are connected to the electricity network and receiving power. Check the connections between small electric poles and ensure they are properly aligned.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventories\n- Regularly check and clear full inventories, such as chests connected to mining drills, to prevent halting of operations."}
