{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (2.0, -63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (2.0, -63.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it at position (2.5, -61.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (4.0, -63.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, -61.5): Transfers items from the mining drill to the furnace. Currently waiting for space in the destination.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, -61.5): Stores iron ore (236 units).\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (6.0, -63.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to extract items\n- **Issue**: Repeated failures to extract iron plates or iron ore from furnaces or chests.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the target entity (furnace or chest) contains the required items before attempting extraction. Verify the entity's inventory status.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- **Issue**: Attempting to place a wooden chest at (4.5, -61.5) while the player is at (0, 0).\n- **Solution**: Move closer to the target position before placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without required resources\n- **Issue**: Attempting to craft a wooden chest without having wood in the inventory.\n- **Solution**: Gather raw resources (e.g., wood) before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n#### Errors when inventory is full\n- **Issue**: Attempting to pick up items from a chest while the inventory is full.\n- **Solution**: Clear space in the inventory or drop unnecessary items before picking up new ones.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- **Issue**: Attempting to get or interact with a wooden chest at (4.5, -61.5) that does not exist.\n- **Solution**: Verify the existence and position of the target entity before interacting with it.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces lack ingredients\n- **Issue**: Furnaces at (4.0, -63.0) and (6.0, -63.0) are idle due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Solution**: Ensure furnaces are supplied with raw materials (e.g., iron ore and fuel) to maintain continuous operation.\n\n#### Errors when inserter output is blocked\n- **Issue**: Burner inserter at (3.5, -61.5) is blocked due to a full chest or lack of space.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the destination entity (e.g., chest or furnace) has space to accept items. Clear or expand storage as needed."}
