{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore, currently contains 652 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It has been repositioned multiple times to ensure proper alignment.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source entity (chest) and the drop position with the target entity (furnace). Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring items.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters and Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters and mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel. Consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid errors related to missing items."}
