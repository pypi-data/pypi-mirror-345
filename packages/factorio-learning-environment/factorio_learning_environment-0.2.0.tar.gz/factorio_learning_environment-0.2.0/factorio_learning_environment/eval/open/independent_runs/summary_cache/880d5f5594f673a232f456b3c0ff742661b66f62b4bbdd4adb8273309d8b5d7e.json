If an entity shows \"NO POWER,\" check the connections and power supply.\n\n### Errors related to furnace ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. If a furnace shows \"NO INGREDIENTS TO SMELT,\" check the input inventory and supply chain.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Make sure to check the surrounding area before placing any structures to avoid placing them in occupied tiles."}
