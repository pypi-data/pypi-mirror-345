{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with coal inventory.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal to the chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) for coal storage.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity, such as a chest or mining drill, contains the necessary items for the inserter to transfer. This can be resolved by checking the inventory of the source entity and refilling it if necessary.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Make sure to keep the furnace supplied with raw materials, such as iron ore, to prevent it from idling. Regularly check the furnace's source inventory and replenish it with the required ingredients.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently present on the map."}
