{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) with 32 units of coal, currently working and producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5), responsible for moving items into the furnace, currently waiting for space in destination.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5), storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), fueled with coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5), used for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) with 14 units of coal, currently full with iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5), storing iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any entity.\n\n### Errors when inserters are blocked\n- Regularly check the destination of inserters to ensure there is enough space for items being transferred. If the destination is full, clear space to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when furnaces are full\n- Continuously monitor the output of furnaces and extract items regularly to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
