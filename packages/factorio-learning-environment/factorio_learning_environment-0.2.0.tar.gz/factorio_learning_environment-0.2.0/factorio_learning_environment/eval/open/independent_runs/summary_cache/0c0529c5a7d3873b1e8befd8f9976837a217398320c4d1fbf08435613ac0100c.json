{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities are currently not functional.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently without power.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple PipeGroups are present, but all are currently empty and not connected to any fluid systems effectively.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles are present but not effectively connected to provide power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure pipes are correctly aligned and connected to facilitate fluid flow. Verify the start and end points of pipe connections.\n\n### Errors in Electric Pole Connection\n- Confirm that electric poles are within range to connect to each other and to the steam engine to provide power.\n\n### Steam Engine Power Generation\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to a functional boiler and offshore pump to generate power. Check for any missing connections or obstructions.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- When accessing attributes of objects, ensure that the object has the attribute. For example, 'PipeGroup' does not have a 'direction' attribute.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to a power source to function properly. Check the electric pole connections and ensure they are supplying power to the inserters.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Supply\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply lines and inventory to provide required materials."}
