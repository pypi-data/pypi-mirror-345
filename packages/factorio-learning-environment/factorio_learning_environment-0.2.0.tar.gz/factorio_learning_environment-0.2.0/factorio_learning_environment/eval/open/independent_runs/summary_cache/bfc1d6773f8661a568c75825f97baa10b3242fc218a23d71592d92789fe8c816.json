{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting to the boiler and offshore pump.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5) connected to the nearest electric pole at position(-10.5, 22.5).\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5) connected to the nearest electric pole at position(-10.5, 22.5).\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 50232 at position(-11.5, 21.5).\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 50234 at position(-4.5, 21.5).\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 50235 at position(-4.5, 23.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1).\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2).\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1).\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all structures requiring power, such as the lab and assembling machine, are connected to an active electric network. Verify that electric poles are placed correctly and are not too far from the entities they are meant to power.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. For instance, an error occurred when trying to place a small electric pole at a position where another entity already exists. Remove the existing entity before placing a new one.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### General tips\n- Regularly check the status of your entities to ensure they are functioning correctly and receiving the necessary resources or power."}
