{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at various positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and others as part of the fluid system.\n\n### Inserter Power Network\nConsists of:\n- Inserters at Positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) connected to power poles.\n- Power poles at various positions, including (17.5, -0.5), part of the electricity group.\n\n### Furnace and Chest Setup\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (15.0, 0.0) with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n- Wooden Chest at Position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (18.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n- Inserters associated with the furnace and chests, positioned at (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5), with warnings of \"not receiving electricity\".\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure no other entities occupy the target tile before placing pipes or underground pipes. Remove existing entities if necessary.\n- Adjust the placement strategy for underground pipes to avoid unplaceable terrain or occupied tiles.\n\n### Connectivity Issues with Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly connected to provide input liquid to the boiler and steam engine. Check for any disconnected or improperly placed pipes.\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the pipe network supplying the boiler.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply Issues\n- Connect inserters to a power network to ensure they receive electricity. Check the connection of power poles and ensure they are linked to a power source.\n- Address warnings such as \"not receiving electricity\" by verifying the electrical connections and power supply to the inserters."}
