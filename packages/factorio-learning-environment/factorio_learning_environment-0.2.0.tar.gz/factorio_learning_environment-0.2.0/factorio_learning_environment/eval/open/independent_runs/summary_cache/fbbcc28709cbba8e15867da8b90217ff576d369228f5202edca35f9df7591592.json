If a connection fails due to missing small electric poles (e.g. \u201cRequired number \u2013 5, Available \u2013 0\u201d), ensure adequate stock prior to execution.\n  \u2022 Also, confirm that inventory carries sufficient resources for both electrical and fluid connection components.\n\n- Electrical Network Stability:\n  \u2022 Ensure that after connecting power components, the Electricity Group reports a positive voltage. A zero voltage reading indicates that the power network configuration is incomplete or improperly connected.\n  \n- (Include previous best practices on buildable area checks and correct property access to prevent placement errors.)"}
