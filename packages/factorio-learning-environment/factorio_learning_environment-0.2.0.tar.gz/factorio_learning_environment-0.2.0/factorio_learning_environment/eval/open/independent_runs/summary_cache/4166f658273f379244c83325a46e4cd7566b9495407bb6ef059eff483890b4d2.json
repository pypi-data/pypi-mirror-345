Verify and use the active fluid system identifier\u2014now [26940] as seen in the boiler, offshore pump, and PipeGroup\u2014for successful water supply.\n\n\u2022 Fixed Delay Strategy without Dynamic Connectivity Checks:\n  - The repeated use of a fixed 10\u2011second delay for pipeline stabilization has not resolved the connectivity issues. Implement real\u2011time verification of pipeline readiness before reattempting connection operations."}
