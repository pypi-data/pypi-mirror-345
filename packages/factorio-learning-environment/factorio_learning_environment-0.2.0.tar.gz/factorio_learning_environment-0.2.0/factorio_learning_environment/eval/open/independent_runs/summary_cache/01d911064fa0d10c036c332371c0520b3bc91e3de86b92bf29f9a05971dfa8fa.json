For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources for crafting\n- Verify that you have enough resources before crafting. For instance, attempting to craft a stone furnace without sufficient stone will lead to an assertion error.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure that the entity contains the items you are trying to extract. Repeated attempts to extract iron plates from the furnace when it does not contain any will result in extraction errors.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in production entities\n- Regularly check the status of production entities like furnaces to ensure they have the necessary ingredients to operate. A furnace with no ingredients will not produce any output and will generate warnings.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. For example, attempting to place a burner inserter next to the furnace with a wooden chest already occupying the space will result in an error. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the destination for the inserter to drop items. If the inserter is waiting for space in the destination, place a sink object at the specified position to unblock the output.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place a burner mining drill without having one in inventory\n- Before placing a burner mining drill, ensure that you have crafted or have one in your inventory. Attempting to place without having one will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources to craft a burner mining drill\n- Gather the necessary resources, such as iron plates and iron gear wheels, before attempting to craft a burner mining drill. If resources are insufficient, the crafting process will fail.\n\n### Errors when crafting due to missing raw resources\n- Raw resources like stone must be gathered before crafting items that require them. Ensure you have collected the necessary raw resources to avoid crafting errors.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract from a non-existent or empty entity\n- Ensure that the entity you are"}
