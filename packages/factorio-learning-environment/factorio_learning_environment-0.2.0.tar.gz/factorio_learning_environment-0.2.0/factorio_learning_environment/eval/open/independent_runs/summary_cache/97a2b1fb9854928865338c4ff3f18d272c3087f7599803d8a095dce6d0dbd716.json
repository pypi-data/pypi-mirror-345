{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a source of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with a source of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with a source of iron ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the furnaces and facilitating the movement of resources.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport belts at various positions (-24.5, -69.5), (-22.5, -69.5), (-21.5, -69.5), etc., moving copper ore to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport belts at various positions (-15.5, -54.5), (-14.5, -54.5), etc., moving iron ore to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) facilitating the movement of iron plates into the chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) facilitating the movement of items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the tile where you want to place an inserter is not already occupied by another entity like a transport belt. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position before placing the inserter.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to insert items into a furnace or any other entity, verify that the required items are available in your inventory to prevent insertion errors.\n\n### Ensure fuel availability for mining drills\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills to avoid them running out of fuel, which halts resource extraction.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserter to pick up. Adjust the supply chain or inventory to prevent inserters from idling."}
