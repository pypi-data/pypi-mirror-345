Regularly check and refuel them to avoid mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency. Consider setting up a logistics system to automate the supply of ingredients to furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `final_inventory: dict` - Represents the final inventory state, including items such as 'wooden-chest', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
