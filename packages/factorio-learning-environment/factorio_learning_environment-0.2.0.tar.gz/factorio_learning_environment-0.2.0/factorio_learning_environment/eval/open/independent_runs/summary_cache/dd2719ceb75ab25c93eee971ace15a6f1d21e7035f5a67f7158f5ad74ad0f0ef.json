{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and actively mining iron ore.\n  - Drops mined iron ore into a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Positioned at (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for additional storage.\n  - Chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) is actively smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Iron Plate Storage**:\n  - Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n  - Some chests are full, indicating a need for more storage or usage of iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. The chest at (4.5, -58.5) is full, which stops the mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to avoid idle time. The furnaces at (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) are currently not smelting due to a lack of iron ore.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore_count`: int, tracks the number of iron ores extracted.\n  - `iron_plate_count`: int, tracks the number of iron plates in inventory.\n  - `coal_count`: int, tracks the amount of coal available for fueling operations."}
