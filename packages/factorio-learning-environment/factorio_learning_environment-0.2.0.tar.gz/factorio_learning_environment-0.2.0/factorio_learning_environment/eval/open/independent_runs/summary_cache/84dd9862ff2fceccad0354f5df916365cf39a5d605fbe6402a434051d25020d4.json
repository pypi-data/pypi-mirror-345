{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Water Extraction and Power Generation Setup (near x=-9, y=71 and x=74, y=67)\n\nThis setup extracts water and uses it to generate steam power, although the components are not yet fully connected or fueled.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=71.5): Extracts water from the lake. Status: WORKING.\n*   **PipeGroup** starting at (x=-8.5, y=71.5): Transports water from the Offshore Pump towards the Boilers. Consists of multiple pipe segments connecting (x=-8.5, y=71.5) to (x=69.5, y=71.5). Status: FULL\\_OUTPUT, contains water.\n*   **Boiler** at position (x=71.5, y=71.0): Intended to heat water into steam. Connected to the water pipe network. Status: NO\\_FUEL.\n*   **Boiler** at position (x=74."}
