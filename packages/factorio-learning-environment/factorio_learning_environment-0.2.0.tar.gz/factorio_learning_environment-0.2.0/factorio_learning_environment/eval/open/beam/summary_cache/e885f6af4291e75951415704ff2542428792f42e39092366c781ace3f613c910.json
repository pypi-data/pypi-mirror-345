{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Inserted with 10 coal\n  - Inserted with 10 iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, a stone furnace must be crafted or available in the inventory before placement.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient smelting output\n- Ensure that the furnace has completed smelting before attempting to extract items. Verify the smelting process and wait until the required number of iron plates are produced.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Make sure the entity contains the expected items before attempting extraction. Check the furnace's contents to confirm the presence of iron plates before extracting.\n\n### Assertion errors due to unmet conditions\n- Verify that the conditions for assertions are met before executing them. For example, ensure that the required number of iron plates is smelted before asserting their count."}
