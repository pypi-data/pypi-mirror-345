Misalignment can prevent items from being transferred correctly.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Always check your inventory for the required fuel before attempting to refuel entities. Running out of fuel can halt operations.\n\n### Errors with Ingredient Supply\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check the supply chain to prevent production halts due to missing ingredients.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
