{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a result inventory containing 100 copper plates. The furnace is currently not smelting due to having no ingredients.\n\n### Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Factory\nThis structure is implied from the interactions but not explicitly defined in the logs. It consists of:\n- Furnace at position (0, 0) producing copper plates.\n- Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when crafting automation-science-pack**:\n  - Ensure that you have the required ingredients available in the furnace or crafting machine before attempting to craft items. In this case, copper plates are required for crafting the automation-science-pack, but the furnace is not currently smelting due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n- **Errors when transferring items to the chest**:\n  - Verify that the source inventory (in this case, the player's inventory) has the items available for transfer before attempting to transfer them to the chest. The logs indicate that there were no copper plates available in the player's inventory to transfer to the chest.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to missing ingredients (copper plates) required for crafting.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary containing items in the player's inventory, type: `dict`\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Dictionary containing items in the furnace's inventory, type: `dict`\n  - `chest_inventory`: Dictionary containing items in the chest's inventory, type: `dict`"}
