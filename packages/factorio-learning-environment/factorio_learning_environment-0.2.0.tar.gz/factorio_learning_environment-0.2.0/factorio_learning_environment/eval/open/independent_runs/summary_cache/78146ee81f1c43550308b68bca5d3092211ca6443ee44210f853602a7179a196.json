{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at Position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (52.0, -79.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (53.5, -79.5) that transfers items from the furnace to a chest\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (54.5, -79.5) storing iron plates\n\n#### Coal Storage Setup at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) (empty)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (43.5, -80.5) storing coal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5) transferring items between the chests\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) (empty)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from the drill to the chest\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -48.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n#### General Storage Area at Position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (0.5, 0.5) storing various items (coal, iron ore, iron plates, etc.)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron ore\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing coal\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (3.5, 0.5) storing coal\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron ore\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (5.5, 0.5) storing iron plates and iron gear wheels\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors related to fuel and resource management\n- **Out of fuel in Burner Mining Drill**: Ensure the mining drill has sufficient coal to operate. Regularly check and refill fuel in burner-based entities.\n- **Chest at drop position is full**: Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to allow the mining drill to continue operation.\n\n#### Errors related to inserter operation\n- **Inserter waiting for source items**: Ensure the inserter has items to pick up from the source entity. Check the source entity's inventory and ensure it is not empty.\n\n#### General tips\n- **Monitor entity statuses**: Regularly check the status and warnings of entities to address issues like lack of fuel, full chests, or missing ingredients promptly.\n- **Optimize storage**: Consolidate storage chests to avoid unnecessary duplication and ensure efficient item management."}
