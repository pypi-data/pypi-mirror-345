{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59) smelting copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in a row with collection chests:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10, -59) with chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8, -59) with chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6, -59) with chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll chests collecting iron ore\n\n### Iron Smelting Line (0, 0)\nFour parallel smelting units consisting of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0)\n- Input inserters at (0.5,-1.5), (2.5,-1.5), (4.5,-1.5), and (6.5,-1.5)\n- Input coal chests at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), and (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output inserters at (0.5,1.5), (2.5,1.5), (4.5,1.5), and (6.5,1.5)\n- Output iron plate chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), and (6.5,2.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing new entities\n- When placing chests or other entities next to existing ones, ensure the target position is free\n- Consider using different spacing or direction parameters when the default placement position is occupied\n\n### Errors when trying to pick up non-existent entities\n- Verify that the entity exists at the target position before attempting to pick it up\n- Double check coordinates when trying to remove entities\n- Consider adding existence checks before pickup operations"}
