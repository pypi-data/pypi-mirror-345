{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (41.0, -85.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill facing DOWN\n- Burner inserter facing RIGHT at (41.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden chest at (42.5, -83.5)\nPurpose: Automated coal extraction and storage system\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line 1 at (-20.0, -54.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill facing DOWN\n- Stone furnace at (-19.0, -52.0)\nPurpose: Mining and smelting iron ore into plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line 2 at (-14.0, -56.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill facing DOWN\n- Stone furnace at (-13.0, -54.0)\nPurpose: Mining and smelting iron ore into plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Orientation Issues\n- Ensure proper orientation of inserters before placement - multiple attempts were made to correctly orient the coal inserter\n- When placing inserters, verify both pickup and drop positions align with source and destination entities\n\n### Production Flow Issues\n- Mining drills showing \"output blocked by item on the ground\" warnings - ensure proper item collection mechanisms are in place\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure continuous supply of raw materials\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to maintain continuous operation\n- Ensure sufficient space in destination containers to prevent blockages\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\nFunction Patterns:\n- Extraction operations from furnaces (consistently successful)\n- Placement operations for inserters and furnaces (mixed success)\n- Entity rotation operations (successful but often needed correction)\n- Fuel addition operations (successful)\n\nStatus Monitoring:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL"}
