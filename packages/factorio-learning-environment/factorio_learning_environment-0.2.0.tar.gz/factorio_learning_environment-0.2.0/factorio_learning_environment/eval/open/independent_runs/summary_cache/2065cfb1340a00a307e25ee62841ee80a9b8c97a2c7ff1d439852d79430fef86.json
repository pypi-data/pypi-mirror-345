{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) that extracts resources, currently fueled with coal and has a drop position to a nearby chest.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting fuel into the Burner Mining Drill**: \n  - Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before attempting to insert fuel into the Burner Mining Drill. Empty the chest to continue mining.\n  \n- **Errors when inserting items into the Stone Furnace**: \n  - Ensure that you have sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the Stone Furnace. Check your inventory levels prior to insertion.\n\n- **Errors when extracting from entities**: \n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: \n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `furnace_inventory`: dict\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: str\n  - `stone_furnace_status`: str"}
