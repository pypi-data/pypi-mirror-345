# AgentShield SDK

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/agentshield-sdk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/agentshield-sdk) Python SDK for the AgentShield API - Runtime security for agentic AI applications.

AgentShield provides a backend service that AI agents can query *before* performing potentially risky actions (like external API calls or code execution). It checks the proposed action against configurable security policies and returns an "allow" or "block" decision. This SDK provides convenient Python functions for agents to interact with a deployed AgentShield API.
