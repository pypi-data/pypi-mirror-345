"""
This module provides a function to assign an issue to a specific user using a given request function.

The assign_issue function takes three parameters:
- request_fn: a function to make a request (e.g., from requests library)
- issue_key: the key of the issue to be assigned
- assignee: the username of the user to whom the issue will be assigned

If successful, the function returns True. If an AssignIssueError is raised during the process, it prints an error
message and raises AssignIssueError with a custom message.
