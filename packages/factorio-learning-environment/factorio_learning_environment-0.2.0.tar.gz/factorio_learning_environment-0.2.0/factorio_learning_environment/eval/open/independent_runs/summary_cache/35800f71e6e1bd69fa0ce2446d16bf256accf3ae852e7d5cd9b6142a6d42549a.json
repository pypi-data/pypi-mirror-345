{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (-0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 24.0) \n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n\n### Lab at position(5.5, -12.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab at position (5.5, -12.5)\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple pipes connecting various entities, including:\n  - Pipe at position (-6.5, 24.5)\n  - Pipe at position (-5.5, 22.5)\n  - Pipe at position (-4.5, 22.5)\n  - Pipe at position (-3.5, 22.5)\n  - Pipe at position (-2.5, 22.5)\n  - Additional pipes forming part of the fluid systems\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, you need small electric poles to connect the lab and steam engine.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Make sure that all power-consuming entities (like the lab and steam engine) are connected to a power network. If they are not connected, they will not function properly.\n\n### Errors with no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inventory and supply lines to ensure adequate resources are available."}
