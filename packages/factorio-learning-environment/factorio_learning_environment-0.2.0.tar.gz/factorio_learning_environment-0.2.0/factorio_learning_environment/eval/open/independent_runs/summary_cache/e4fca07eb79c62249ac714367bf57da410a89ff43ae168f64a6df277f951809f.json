{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) receiving iron ore from the mining drill and producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a burner mining drill without having one in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Verify that the target location is free and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. This includes checking for existing entities or terrain obstacles that might prevent placement.\n\n### Furnace not producing iron plates\n- Check the setup of the furnace to ensure it has a sufficient supply of iron ore and fuel to operate. Ensure that the input and output paths are correctly configured for continuous production."}
