{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=41.5, y=-80.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions:\n  - (x=41.5, y=-80.5) containing coal.\n  - (x=42.5, y=-80.5) containing iron plates.\n  - (x=44.5, y=-80.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n  - (x=45.5, y=-80.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n  - (x=47.5, y=-80.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n  - (x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing coal.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions:\n  - (x=43.5, y=-80.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Processing\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n- **Iron Chests** at positions:\n  - (x=-18.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore.\n  - (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore.\n  - (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) empty.\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore.\n  - (x=-13.5, y=-49.5) empty.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from mining drills\n- Ensure that the mining drill's output is clear before attempting to extract items. Check if the drop position is occupied and clear it if necessary.\n\n### Errors when supplying iron ore to furnaces\n- Verify that you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply it to furnaces. Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors when placing new storage\n- Before placing a new storage entity like an iron chest, ensure the target location is free of other objects to avoid placement failures.\n\n### Errors when transferring items to non-existent entities\n- Double-check the positions of entities before attempting to transfer items to them. Ensure that the target entity exists at the specified location to avoid transfer errors."}
