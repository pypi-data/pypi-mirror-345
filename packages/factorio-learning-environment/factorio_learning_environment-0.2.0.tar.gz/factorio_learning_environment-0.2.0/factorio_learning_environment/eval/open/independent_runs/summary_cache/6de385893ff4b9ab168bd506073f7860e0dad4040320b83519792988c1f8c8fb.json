{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a status of 'NO_FUEL', connected to multiple pipes.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status 'WORKING', supplying water through connected pipes.\n\nThe structure is connected via:\n- **PipeGroup** (fluid_system=11222) starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), carrying water.\n- **PipeGroup** (fluid_system=11211) starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles distributed across various positions including (x=7.5, y=8.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), etc., with a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are correctly aligned and within range. The failure to connect pipes from the boiler to the steam engine suggests a possible misalignment or incorrect positioning.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of boilers to ensure continuous operation. The boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) is out of fuel, which can halt the electricity generation process.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: Attempted to connect pipes between boiler and steam engine but failed due to misalignment or incorrect positioning. Ensure entities are correctly aligned before invoking this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **pipes**: List of connected pipes between entities, used in the function `connect_entities`.\n- **fluid_systems**: Identifiers for different fluid networks, such as 11211 and 11222, indicating separate pipe networks.\n- **voltage**: Represents the voltage level in the electricity network, currently at 0, indicating no power flow."}
