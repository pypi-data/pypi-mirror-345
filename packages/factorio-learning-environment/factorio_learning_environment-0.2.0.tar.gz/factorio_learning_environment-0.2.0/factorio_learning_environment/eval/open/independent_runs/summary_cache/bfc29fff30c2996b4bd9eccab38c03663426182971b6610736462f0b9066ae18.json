However, two furnace structures were actively used for metal processing during these steps:\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a furnace entity employed to convert iron ore (with coal) into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at position (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\nConsists of a furnace entity used to smelt copper ore thereby producing copper plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 get_entities() invocation issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify the API signature before calling get_entities. Avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional parameters.  \n\u2003\u2013 If a function might return None, initialize with an empty list to safely iterate over the results.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement and inventory validation  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that a Lab unit is present in the inventory before attempting to place it at a designated location.  \n\u2003\u2013 Check that the target placement tile is unoccupied and available for construction.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting resource chain problems  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all intermediate items (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available or producible through established production chains before initiating Lab crafting.  \n\u2003\u2013 Pre-assess resource levels and production capabilities to avoid failures related to missing sub-ingredients."}
