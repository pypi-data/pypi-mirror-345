{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to mine and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore. Currently has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full, which is preventing further mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Used to store extracted iron ore and iron plates. It contains 8 iron ore and 9 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates. It is currently working but has not produced any iron plates due to the lack of sufficient input or fuel.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Not Producing Iron Plates\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is adequately supplied with both iron ore and coal. Verify that the inserter is correctly positioned and fueled to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from stopping due to a full chest.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the burner inserter is properly fueled and that there is a continuous supply of iron ore in the chest for the inserter to transfer to the furnace.\n\n### Refueling Issues\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel the mining drill, inserter, and furnace to ensure continuous operation."}
