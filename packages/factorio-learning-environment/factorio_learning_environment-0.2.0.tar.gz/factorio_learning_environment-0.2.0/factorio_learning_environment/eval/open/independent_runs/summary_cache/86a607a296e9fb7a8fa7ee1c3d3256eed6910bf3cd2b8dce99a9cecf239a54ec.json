{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Operation Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (chest) to the target (furnace). Repeated repositioning indicates potential misalignment issues.\n\n### Fuel Management for Entities\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the burner mining drill and burner inserter to ensure continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt operations, as seen with the mining drill and inserter running out of coal.\n\n### Inventory Management for Chests\n- Monitor and manage the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can stop the mining drill from depositing more resources.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to function. The current setup indicates the furnace is not receiving ore, possibly due to misalignment or incorrect inserter settings.\n\n### Resource Extraction Errors\n- When extracting resources, ensure there is enough space in the inventory or target container to accommodate the extracted items."}
