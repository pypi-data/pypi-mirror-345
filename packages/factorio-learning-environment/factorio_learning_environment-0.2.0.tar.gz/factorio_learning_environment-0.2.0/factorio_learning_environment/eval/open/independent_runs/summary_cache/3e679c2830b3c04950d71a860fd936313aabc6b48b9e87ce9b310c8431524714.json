{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-82.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) with a pickup position at (x=53.5, y=-83.5) and a drop position at (x=55.5, y=-83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) with a pickup position at (x=41.5, y=-79.5) and a drop position at (x=41.5, y=-81.5).\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5).\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0).\n- Steam Engine at position (x=7.5, y=39.5).\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with multiple pipe positions.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) with a large inventory of iron plates.\n- Additional Iron Chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=2.5, y=0.5) for storage.\n\n### Laboratory Setup\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently without power.\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs for transporting coal, consisting of multiple belts in the system.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for collecting resources from drills are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Connect all generators and labs to the power network to ensure they receive the necessary power for operation. Check connections and ensure that all components are properly linked.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Ensure that all fluid systems, such as those involving boilers and steam engines, are properly connected and filled with the necessary fluids to function effectively. Check for any disconnected pipes or missing fluid inputs."}
