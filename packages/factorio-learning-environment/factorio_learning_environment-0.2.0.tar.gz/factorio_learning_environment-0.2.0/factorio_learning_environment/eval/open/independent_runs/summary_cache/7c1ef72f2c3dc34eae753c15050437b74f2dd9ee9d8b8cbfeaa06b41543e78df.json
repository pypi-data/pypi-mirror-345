{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these components\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=20.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=19.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5) with a recipe for copper cable\n- Inserter at position (x=13.5, y=0.5) that puts into the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) to the assembling machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storage\n- Inserters and BeltGroups for material transport between structures\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Assembling Machine Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure the assembling machine has sufficient copper plates before starting production. Check the supply chain to ensure copper plates are consistently delivered.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity. Ensure you have the necessary resources available.\n\n### Power Supply Issues\n- Ensure all machines and inserters are connected to a power source. Check the electricity network for any disconnections or insufficient power supply."}
