{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nThis structure is designed for mining coal and consists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) to extract coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=51.5, y=-83.5) to collect coal from the mining drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates need to be smelted in a furnace, and stone is a raw resource that must be gathered.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities without Inventory Items\n- Verify that the required item is in the inventory before attempting to place it. For instance, ensure a wooden chest is available before trying to place one.\n\n### Errors in Extracting from Non-existent or Empty Entities\n- Confirm the presence of the target entity and the required items within it before attempting extraction. For example, ensure the wooden chest contains coal before extracting.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Inventory Checks\n- Use assertions to check inventory levels only when certain that the inventory contains the expected items. This prevents unnecessary assertion errors, such as expecting coal in a chest when it is not present."}
