For example, attempting to insert coal when there is none in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This will prevent placement errors due to occupied tiles."}
