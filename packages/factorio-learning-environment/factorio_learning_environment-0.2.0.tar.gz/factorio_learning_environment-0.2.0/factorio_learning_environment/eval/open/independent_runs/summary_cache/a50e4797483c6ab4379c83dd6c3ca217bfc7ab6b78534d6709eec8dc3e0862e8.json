{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently functioning, while the boiler is out of fuel.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Belt group that connects the furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) to the assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when the boiler is not functioning\n- Ensure that the boiler has sufficient fuel before attempting to operate it. The current status indicates that it is out of fuel.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Verify the positions of the entities before attempting to connect pipes. The connection attempt from the offshore pump to the boiler failed, indicating a need to check the placement and ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. This will help avoid issues with overlapping entities. \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
