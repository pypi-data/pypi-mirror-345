{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following components:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a fuel inventory of coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chests to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -46.5) transferring smelted iron plates to storage.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) facilitating the transfer of items between chests and the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nThis structure is used for storing iron plates and consists of:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) storing a total of 3622 iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -48.5) storing 60 iron plates.\n\n### Idle Stone Furnace at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nThis furnace is currently not in use due to a lack of ingredients:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters are correctly aligned and have access to source items. Regularly check and realign inserters if necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients\n- Monitor the supply of ingredients to the furnaces. Ensure that there is a consistent supply of iron ore to prevent the furnace from running idle.\n\n### Refueling Burner Mining Drill\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner mining drills and refuel them as needed to maintain continuous mining operations."}
