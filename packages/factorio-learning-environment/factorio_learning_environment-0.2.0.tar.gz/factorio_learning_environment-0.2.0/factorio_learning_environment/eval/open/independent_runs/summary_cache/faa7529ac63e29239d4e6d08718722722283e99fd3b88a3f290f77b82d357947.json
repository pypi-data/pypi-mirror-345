{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (27.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (27.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with Inserters and Small Electric Poles for automation\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (19.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with Inserters and Small Electric Poles for automation\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserters and Small Electric Poles for automation\n- Belt group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (17.5, -16.5) with water\n- PipeGroup at position (19.5, -12.5) empty\n- PipeGroup at position (6.5, -7.5) empty\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, voltage is currently 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure you have sufficient resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into the boiler failed due to lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel\n- Keep track of fuel levels in entities like boilers and mining drills to prevent interruptions in operations. Ensure that these entities are refueled regularly.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and assembling machines have the necessary ingredients to operate. For instance, the stone furnaces and assembling machines are currently not operating due to missing ingredients.\n\n### Errors Related to Electricity\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are connected to a power source and receiving electricity. Many entities, such as inserters and assembling machines, are not receiving electricity and are not operational.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Ensure that fluid systems are properly connected and filled with the necessary fluids. The steam engine is not receiving input liquid, and some pipe networks are empty.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Verify that entities are placed correctly and not obstructed by other entities or terrain."}
