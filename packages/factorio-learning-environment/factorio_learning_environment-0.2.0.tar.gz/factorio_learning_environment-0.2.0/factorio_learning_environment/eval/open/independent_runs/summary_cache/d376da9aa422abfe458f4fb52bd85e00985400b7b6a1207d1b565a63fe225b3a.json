{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) facing DOWN with drop position (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5) containing 3 iron ore\n- System status: drill not working (no fuel)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-20.5, -71.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest at (-20.5, -71.5) containing 2 copper ore\n- Original drill still needs replacement\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 15.5) facing UP\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) (out of fuel, contains 200 units of water at 15\u00b0)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting components:\n  - Empty pipe group at (-14.5, 12.5)\n  - Water-filled pipe group at (-16.5, 19.5)\n  - Empty pipe group at (-9.5, 20.5)\n  - Empty pipe group at (5.5, 25.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting broader system\nSystem status:\n- Steam engine not receiving electricity\n- Boiler out of fuel\n- Offshore pump working\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab at (10.5, 0.5) containing 14 automation science packs\n- Currently researching logistics technology\n- No power due to steam engine issues\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Issues\n- Recipes need to be enabled before crafting even if technology is researched\n- Common failing recipes: iron gear wheel\n- Verify recipe is enabled before attempting to craft\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Verify position is clear before placing new entities\n- When replacing entities, ensure proper removal of old entity first\n\n### Resource Extraction Issues\n- Cannot extract from drill's burner inventory directly\n- When mining resources directly, ensure proper positioning within reach\n- Verify resource is within harvesting radius before attempting to harvest\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in all fuel-consuming entities\n- Current critical issue: Both boiler and mining drill have no fuel\n- Stone cannot be used as fuel in boilers or drills\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Steam engine not receiving electricity due to no fuel in boiler\n- Monitor fluid connections between power system components\n- Address \"no input liquid\" warnings in steam engine\n\n### API Usage Issues\n- Ensure proper attribute access when working with positions (x,y coordinates)\n- Handle nil values appropriately in recipe and crafting operations\n- Verify entity existence and proximity before attempting insert operations\n\n### Research Issues\n- Cannot start already researched technologies (e.g., automation)\n- Monitor research progress for currently researching technology"}
