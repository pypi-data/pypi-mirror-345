DesyRDL was developed at https://desy.de[DESY] in the MSK firmware group as a
replacement for its existing proprietary method of register and address map
generation, the "Internal Interface", called "IBUS" in its latest version, check xref:remarks.adoc#internal-interface-ii[References].

The use of SystemRDL&trade; 2.0 standard was considered for a long time,
but due to the lack of open source compilers or parsers, it was dropped.

The decision to use the SystemRDL&trade; 2.0 standard came after
the open source https://github.com/SystemRDL/systemrdl-compiler[SystemRDL compiler] has been published.
This has been proposed by https://techlab.desy.de/[MicroTCA Tech Lab] at DESY when they wrote
https://github.com/MicroTCA-Tech-Lab/hectare[HECTARE], the predecessor of DesyRDL.

This tool relies heavily on https://github.com/SystemRDL/systemrdl-compiler[systemrdl-compiler] by Alex Mykyta and was only
developed because it exists.
