## Documentation

Online documentation is available at [Documentation](https://riskfolio-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The docs include a [tutorial](https://riskfolio-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)
with examples that shows the capacities of Riskfolio-Lib.


## Choosing a Solver

Due to Riskfolio-Lib is based on CVXPY, Riskfolio-Lib can use the same solvers available for CVXPY. The list of solvers compatible with CVXPY is available in [Choosing a solver](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#choosing-a-solver) section of CVXPY's documentation. However, to select an adequate solver for each risk measure we can use the following table that specifies which type of programming technique is used to model each risk measure.

(*) When SDP graph theory constraints are included. In the case of integer programming graph theory constraints, the model assume the SOCP formulation.

(**) For these models is highly recommended to use MOSEK as solver, due to in some cases CLARABEL cannot find a solution and SCS takes too much time to solve them.

LP - Linear Programming refers to problems with a linear objective function and linear constraints.

QP - Quadratic Programming refers to problems with a quadratic objective function and linear constraints.

SOCP - Second Order Cone Programming refers to problems with second-order cone constraints.

SDP - Semidefinite Programming refers to problems with positive semidefinite constraints.

EXP - refers to problems with exponential cone constraints.

POW - refers to problems with 3-dimensional power cone constraints.

```
@misc{riskfolio,
      author = {Dany Cajas},
      title = {Riskfolio-Lib (7.0.1)},
      year  = {2025},
      url   = {https://github.com/dcajasn/Riskfolio-Lib},
      }
```
 
## Development

Riskfolio-Lib development takes place on Github: https://github.com/dcajasn/Riskfolio-Lib


## Consulting Fees

Riskfolio-Lib is an open-source project, but since it's a project that is not financed for any institution, I started charging for consultancies that are not related to errors in source code. Our fees are as follows:

- $ 25 USD (United States Dollars) per question that doesn't require to check code.
- $ 50 USD to check a small size script or code (less than 200 lines of code). The fee of the solution depends on the complexity of the solution:
    - $ 50 USD for simple errors in scripts (modify less than 10 lines of code).
    - For most complex errors the fee depends on the complexity of the solution but the fee is $ 150 USD per hour.
- $ 100 USD to check a medium size script or code (between 201 and 600 lines of code). The fee of the solution depends on the complexity of the solution:
    - $ 50 USD for simple errors in scripts (modify less than 10 lines of code).
    - For most complex errors the fee depends on the complexity of the solution but the fee is $ 150 USD per hour.
- For large size script or code (more than 600 lines of code) the fee is variable depending on the size of the code. The fee of the solution depends on the complexity of the solution:
    - $ 50 USD for simple errors in scripts (modify less than 10 lines of code).
    - For most complex errors the fee depends on the complexity of the solution but the fee is $ 150 USD per hour.

## RoadMap

The plan for this module is to add more functions that will be very useful
to asset managers.

- Add more functions based on suggestion of users.
