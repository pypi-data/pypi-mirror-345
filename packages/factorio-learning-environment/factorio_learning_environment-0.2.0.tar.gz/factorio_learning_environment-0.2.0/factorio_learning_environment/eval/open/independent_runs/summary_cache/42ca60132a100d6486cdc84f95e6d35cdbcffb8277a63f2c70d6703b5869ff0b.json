{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at position(x=37-41, y=-83 to -87)\nComplex mining setup consisting of:\n- 4 Burner mining drills at positions (41.0,-86.0), (37.0,-85.0), (39.0,-85.0), (41.0,-83.0)\n- 4 Wooden chests at positions (40.5,-87.5), (36.5,-86.5), (39.5,-83.5), (34.5,-86.5)\n- 2 Burner inserters at positions (35.5,-86.5), (35.5,-85.5)\nAll drills are currently out of fuel but positioned over coal resources\n\n### Iron/Copper Ore Mining & Smelting at position(x=-28, y=-61)\nMining and smelting setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0,-61.0) mining iron and copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0,-58.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5,-59.5) containing iron and copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5,-59.5) moving materials\n- Additional furnaces at (-23.0,-58.0), (-21.0,-58.0) with associated inserters\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(x=-6 to -10, y=-59)\nLarge iron mining setup with:\n- 3 Burner mining drills at positions (-10.0,-59.0), (-8.0,-59.0), (-6.0,-59.0)\n- Multiple wooden chests at (-9.5,-57.5), (-7.5,-57.5), (-5.5,-57.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n- Multiple burner inserters managing material flow\n\n### Smelting Line at position(x=0 to 6, y=0)\nSeries of furnaces with inserter automation:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at positions (0.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), (4.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0)\n- Multiple burner inserters and wooden chests managing input/output\n- Connected transport belt system for material movement\n\n### Power Generation Complex at position(x=-3.5 to 4.5, y=20-27)\nPower generation setup consisting of:\n- Steam engine at (4.5,20.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5,22.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5,27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting components\n- Small electric pole network distributing power\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Extraction Distance Errors\n- Must be within interaction range of target chest/entity when attempting to extract items\n- Move closer to the chest at (40.5,-87.5) before attempting extraction\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - ensure regular fuel supply\n- Some inserters are waiting for source items - check input supply chains\n- Some chests are reaching capacity - implement better output management\n\n### Fluid System Warnings\n- Steam engine shows \"no input liquid\" warning - ensure proper pipe connections and fluid flow\n- Boiler needs fuel to heat water - maintain coal supply\n\n### Belt System Optimization\n- Several belt groups show empty status - ensure proper material flow and input supply\n- Check belt connections at transition points to prevent bottlenecks"}
