{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0), refueled with coal, currently working with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) with iron ore inventory of 533 units.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests positioned around (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), each containing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-21.5, -54.5) and (-20.5, -54.5) each with 1500 iron plates.\n- Additional Wooden Chests at positions (-18.5, -54.5) and (-19.5, -54.5) each with 1000 iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) with 1476 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore and Plate Storage at Position (-5.5, -52.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-5.5, -52.5) with 232 iron ore.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n\n### Stone Furnace Operations\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, containing 22 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) with similar warnings, containing 22 and 45 iron plates respectively.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -49.5) full with 1600 iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to extract items from chests. This error occurred multiple times when trying to extract iron ore from the chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n\n### Chest Management Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) is currently unable to continue mining due to a full chest at the drop position.\n\n### Furnace Operation Warnings\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Multiple furnaces are currently inactive due to the lack of ingredients.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or important variables have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
