{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14, -49)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12, -51) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14, -49) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) intended to transfer items from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storage purposes.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) intended to transfer items to the chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (52, -82)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52, -82) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) intended to transfer coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -77.5) for storage purposes.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Stone Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace at position (-14, -49) has all required ingredients to operate. Currently, it is not operational due to missing ingredients.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Address the warnings of \"output blocked by item on the ground\" for the Burner Mining Drills. Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output to prevent blockage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- The Burner Inserters are waiting for source items. Ensure that the source items are available and accessible to the inserters to maintain smooth operation.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `coal`: int = 64\n  - `iron-plate`: int = 212"}
