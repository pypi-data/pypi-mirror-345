{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (0.5, 1.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5)\n- Connected to lab at position (6.5, 6.5)\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace with fuel (coal: 18), producing iron plates (8)\n\n### Stone furnace at position (2, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace with fuel (coal: 7), currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest with no items.\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 6.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab requiring 10 automation science packs to complete research, currently has no power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric poles not being powered\n- Ensure that all electric poles are properly connected to the electricity network to avoid the \"NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\" status. \n\n### Errors when using building box for electric poles\n- Review the dimensions and placement of electric poles to avoid errors related to the building box. Make sure the positions are valid and not obstructed.\n\n### Errors when connecting to the lab\n- Ensure that the lab has sufficient power and the required ingredients (automation science packs) to function properly. \n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it, as overlapping entities can cause placement errors."}
