# stack

Stack is a [data structure](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/foundamental/data_structure.md) providing last-in-first-out semantics; also called a LIFO [queue](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/collection/queue.md).

Serves as a [collection](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/collection.md) of elements with two main [operations](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/foundamental/operation.md):

- Push, which adds an element to the [collection](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/collection.md), and
- Pop, which removes the most recently added element.

Additionally, a peek [operation](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/foundamental/operation.md) can, without modifying the stack, return the value of the last element added. The name stack is an analogy to a [set](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/foundamental/set.md) of physical items stacked one atop another, such as a stack of plates.
