{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Power Network\n- Expanded from lab at Position (x=5.5, y=5.5) to power source at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with multiple poles including positions such as (x=9.5, y=23.5), (x=13.5, y=27.5), (x=7.5, y=17.5), (x=7.5, y=13.5), (x=16.5, y=31.5), (x=12.5, y=34.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) connected to a wooden chest at Position (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and another at Position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Iron Chests at Positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs, including positions such as (x=50.5, y=-86.5), (x=48.5, y=-86.5), (x=49.5, y=-86.5), (x=47.5, y=-86.5)\n- Additional belts at positions (x=43.5, y=-84.5) to (x=45.5, y=-84.5) and (x=45.5, y=-85.5) to (x=47.5, y=-85.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between the boiler at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0) and the steam engine at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5) are correctly configured. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Expansion\n- Verify that all poles in the ElectricityGroup are correctly positioned and connected to maintain a continuous power network. Ensure there are no gaps or missing connections between poles.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Regularly check the inventory and ensure that critical resources like coal are adequately stocked to prevent interruptions in mining and power generation."}
