{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) storing iron ore\n\n### Copper Processing Complex at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Primary buffer chest at (20.5, 21.5)\n- Secondary buffer chest at (22.5, 21.5) storing copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0) for smelting\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) storing copper plates\n- Multiple inserters forming a transport chain:\n  - Burner inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving ore from primary to secondary buffer\n  - Burner inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving ore to furnace\n  - Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving plates to output chest\n  - Support inserters at (20.5, 22.5) and (22.5, 22.5)\n\n### Inactive Smelting Station at (-10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\n- Currently inactive with no ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Cannot connect belts directly from a wooden chest\n- Use inserters to move items from chests onto belts\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Ensure proper item flow through inserters to keep furnaces supplied\n- One furnace showing \"furnace fuel source is full\" warning - this is not necessarily an error but indicates potential throughput issues\n\n### Inserter Configuration\n- Multiple inserters showing \"waiting for source items\" status\n- Ensure the complete material flow chain is properly connected and supplied"}
