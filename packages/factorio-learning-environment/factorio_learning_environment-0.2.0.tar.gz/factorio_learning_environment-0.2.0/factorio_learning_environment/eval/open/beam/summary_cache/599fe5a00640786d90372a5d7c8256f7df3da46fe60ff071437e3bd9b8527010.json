{"content": "It appears that the attempt to insert 6 Copper Ore into the Stone Furnace failed because there are no Copper Ore left in your inventory. This indicates that the previous smelting process did not consume all the Copper Ore as expected, and you may have run out of Copper Ore to insert.\n\n### Summary of Actions and Errors:\n1. **Initial Smelting**: You successfully smelted 10 Copper Ore into 3 Copper Plates, leaving you with 6 Copper Ore remaining in the furnace.\n2. **Coal Management**: You inserted 2 coal initially and then 3 coal later, which allowed the furnace to operate.\n3. **Final Attempt to Insert Copper Ore**: The attempt to insert 6 Copper Ore failed because there were no Copper Ore left in your inventory.\n\n### Tips to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Check Inventory Before Inserting**: Always inspect your inventory before attempting to insert items into an entity. This will help you avoid trying to insert items that you no longer have.\n2. **Track Resource Consumption**: Keep track of how many resources you have and how many are being consumed during processing. This will help you plan your actions better.\n3. **Use a Helper Function**: Consider creating a utility function that checks if you have enough resources before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n4. **Monitor Smelting Progress**: Regularly check the furnace inventory during the smelting process to understand how many resources are left and how many have been produced.\n\n### Next Steps:\nSince you have no Copper Ore left, you will need to gather more Copper Ore before you can continue smelting. Move to the nearest Copper Ore resource patch, harvest some more, and then proceed with the smelting process again.", "summary_range": "[1-36]"}
