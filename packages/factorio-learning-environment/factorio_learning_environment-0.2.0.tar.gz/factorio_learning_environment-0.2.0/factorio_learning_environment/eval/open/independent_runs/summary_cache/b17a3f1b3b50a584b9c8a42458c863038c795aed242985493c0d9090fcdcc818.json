{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Coal Mine at position(15.5, -0.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Stone Mine at position(-46.5, -0.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Copper Ore Mine at position(-46.5, 70.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Copper Plate Smelting Factory at position(16.0, 69.0)\nConsists of three stone furnaces at positions (16.0, 69.0), (18.0, 69.0), and (20.0, 69.0)\n\n### Automation Science Pack Factory\nConsists of two assembling machines at positions (0.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator at position(-4.5, 0.0)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5), a boiler at position(-4.5, 0.0), and a steam engine at position(-4.5, 3.5)\n\n### Power Pole at position(-2.5, 3.5)\nConsists of a small electric pole at position(-2.5, 3.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variable Errors\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. For example, 'entity' was not defined in Step 3 and Step 52.\n- Ensure that variables are correctly spelled. In Step 19, 'ab' was not defined.\n\n### Harvesting Errors\n- Make sure to move to the target entity before harvesting. In Step 4, the agent tried to harvest iron ore without being at the correct position.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available before crafting. In Step 5, the agent tried to craft stone furnaces without having enough stone.\n- Ensure that the required sub-ingredients can be crafted. In Steps 12, 16, 17, 18, 30, 32, and 34, the agent failed to craft assembling-machine-1, electronic-circuit, copper-cable, or iron-gear-wheel because it couldn't craft iron-plate or copper-plate.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Check if the target position is occupied before placing an entity. In Steps 6, 29, 50, 54, 57, 60, 61, and 62, the agent tried to place a stone furnace, steam engine, or small electric pole at a position that was already occupied.\n- Verify that the entity to be placed is available in the inventory. In Step 38, the agent tried to place assembling-machine-1 without having it in the inventory.\n\n### Insertion Errors\n- Verify that the item to be inserted is available in the inventory. In Steps 7, 20, 33, 28, and 39, the agent tried to insert iron ore, copper ore, or iron-gear-wheel into a furnace or assembling machine without having the respective item in the inventory.\n- Verify that the correct item is being inserted. In Step 20, the agent tried to insert copper ore into a furnace but didn't have copper ore in the inventory.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item to be extracted. In Steps 8, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 32, and 35, the agent tried to extract iron-plate or copper-plate from a stone-furnace that did not contain the respective item.\n\n### Entity Retrieval Errors\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before trying to retrieve it. In Step 41, the agent tried to get a steam engine at a position where it didn't exist.\n- Ensure that the entity exists on the map before trying to retrieve it. In Steps 43, 44, 48, and 49, the agent tried to get an offshore pump or steam engine without checking if it existed on the map.\n- Ensure that the entity is correctly indexed when retrieving from a list. In Steps 43, 44, and 48, the agent tried to access the first element of an empty list.\n\n### Power Connection Errors\n- Ensure that a steam engine is present on the map before trying to connect power. In Steps 45, 47, 51, 53, and 57, the agent tried to connect power without a steam engine or with incorrect entities.\n- Ensure that the power pole is correctly placed and not occupied. In Steps 57, 60, 61, and 62, the agent tried to place a power pole at an occupied position.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
