For example, the error occurred when trying to get a lab at position (6.0, 0.0) where no lab was found.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power, such as labs and electricity generators, are properly connected to an electric network to avoid status issues like NO_POWER or NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
