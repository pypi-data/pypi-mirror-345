{"content": "It looks like the furnace's inventory is full, which is preventing the insertion of coal. Here\u2019s how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Furnace Inventory**: Before inserting items, inspect the furnace's inventory to see what it currently holds and free up space if necessary.\n\n2. **Clear or Adjust Inventory**: If the furnace is full of items that are not needed, remove them to make space for the necessary inputs.\n\n3. **Insert Items in Smaller Quantities**: If space is limited, try inserting smaller quantities of coal and copper ore.\n\nHere's an updated approach:\n\n```python\n# Check the furnace's inventory\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace Inventory: {furnace_inventory}\")\n\n# Remove unnecessary items if the inventory is full\nif furnace_inventory.is_full():\n    # Assuming we want to clear out any non-essential items\n    for item, quantity in furnace_inventory.items():\n        if item not in {Prototype.Coal, Prototype.CopperOre}:\n            remove_item(item, furnace, quantity)\n            print(f\"Removed {quantity} of {item} from furnace.\")\n\n# Try inserting coal and copper ore in smaller quantities\ncoal_to_insert = min(5, furnace_inventory.get_free_slots(Prototype.Coal))\ncopper_ore_to_insert = min(10, furnace_inventory.get_free_slots(Prototype.CopperOre))\n\nif coal_to_insert > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, coal_to_insert)\n    print(f\"Inserted {coal_to_insert} coal into furnace.\")\n\nif copper_ore_to_insert > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace, copper_ore_to_insert)\n    print(f\"Inserted {copper_ore_to_insert} copper ore into furnace.\")\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n\n- **Inventory Management**: Always check and manage inventories before inserting items to avoid errors.\n- **Logging**: Use print statements to track what\u2019s happening at each step, which helps in debugging.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage situations where inventories are full or resources are insufficient.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage the furnace inventory more effectively and proceed with crafting the necessary components.", "summary_range": "[1-310]"}
