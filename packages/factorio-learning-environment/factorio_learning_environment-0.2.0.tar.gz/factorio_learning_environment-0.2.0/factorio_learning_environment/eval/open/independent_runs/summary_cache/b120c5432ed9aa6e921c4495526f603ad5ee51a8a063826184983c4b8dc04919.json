{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storage\n- BeltGroup connecting the chest to other entities\n\n### Iron Plate Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for output\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) that moves items from the chest to the furnace\n\n### Coal Mine at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the transport belts are properly aligned and connected. The error \"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'\" suggests that there might be an issue with the belt placement or connection. Verify the belt network to ensure all segments are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Output Blockage Errors\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity (such as a chest or another processing unit) to accept outputs from drills or furnaces. This will prevent output blockage warnings and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills and Burner Inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel. This will avoid interruptions in resource extraction and item movement.\n\n### Ingredient Supply Errors\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. The warning 'no ingredients to smelt' indicates that the furnace is not receiving the required input materials. Check the supply lines and ensure that the necessary resources are being delivered to the furnaces."}
