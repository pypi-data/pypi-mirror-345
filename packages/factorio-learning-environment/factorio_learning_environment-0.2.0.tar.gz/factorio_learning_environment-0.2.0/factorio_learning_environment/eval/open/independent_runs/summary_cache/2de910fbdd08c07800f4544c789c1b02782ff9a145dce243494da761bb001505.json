{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) to the assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are within the correct distance. In this case, the offshore pump and steam engine were too far apart to connect with a pipe.\n\n### Errors related to undefined functions\n- Verify that all functions you intend to use are defined. The error with `shift_entity` indicates that this function is not recognized. Check your code for typos or ensure that the function is properly defined in your environment.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. This can prevent issues with overlapping entities."}
