Initially it processed 10 iron ore with 5 coal to produce 6 iron plates and then smelted an additional batch (15 iron ore with added coal) yielding 9 iron plates.\n- Iron Chest (position: 1.5, 0.5)  \n  Placed adjacent to the furnace to store the produced iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position: -16.0, -51.0)  \n  Set up for automated iron ore extraction. Its designated drop position is (-15.5, -49.5) for output.\n- Iron Chest (position: -14.5, -49.5)  \n  Placed to collect the mining output from the drill after repositioning to better resolve output blockage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Harvesting Proximity Error  \n  \u2013 Move the agent within immediate reach of a resource patch before initiating harvesting commands to avoid out-of-range failures.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Verification for Placement  \n  \u2013 Verify that the required entity is present in the inventory prior to placement to prevent placement attempts with missing items.\n\n\u2022 Ingredient Dependency Error for Crafting Composite Items  \n  \u2013 Confirm that all sub-ingredients (for example, ensuring sufficient iron plates) are available or producible before crafting composite items like transport belts.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range Error  \n  \u2013 Ensure the agent is moved closer to the target location before placing an entity; placement errors will occur if the target position is out of the allowed range.\n\n\u2022 Output Sink Blockage  \n  \u2013 When setting up automated mining, position sink entities (such as chests) correctly within the drill\u2019s drop zone to avoid output blockages and associated warnings."}
