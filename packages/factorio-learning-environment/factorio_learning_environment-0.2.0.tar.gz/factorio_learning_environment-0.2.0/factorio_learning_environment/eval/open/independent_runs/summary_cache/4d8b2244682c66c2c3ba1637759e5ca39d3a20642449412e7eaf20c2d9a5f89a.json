{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position (x=8.5, y=13.5)\n- Output inserter (burner-inserter) at position (x=10.5, y=13.5)\n- Output chest (wooden-chest) at position (x=11.5, y=13.5)\n- Iron gear input system:\n  - Chest at position (x=7.5, y=9.5)\n  - Inserter at position (x=7.5, y=10.5)\n- Copper plate input system:\n  - Chest at position (x=9.5, y=9.5)\n  - Inserter at position (x=9.5, y=10.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-4.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (x=-4.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-4.5, y=16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups (fluid systems 4150, 4158)\n- Electric pole network connecting various structures\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at various locations:\n1. Setup at x=-28, y=-61:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (x=-27.5, y=-59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (x=-26.5, y=-59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (x=-25.0, y=-59.0)\n   - Output inserter at (x=-23.5, y=-58.5)\n   - Output chest at (x=-22.5, y=-58.5)\n\n2. Setup at x=-18, y=-53:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (x=-17.5, y=-51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (x=-16.5, y=-51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n   - Output inserter at (x=-13.5, y=-50.5)\n   - Output chest at (x=-12.5, y=-50.5)\n\n3. Setup at x=41, y=-82:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest at (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones, particularly around transport belts and inserters\n- When placing entities next to assembling machines, ensure proper spacing and direction to avoid conflicts with existing structures\n- Consider the full dimensions of entities (especially multi-tile entities like furnaces) when planning placement\n\n### Direction Related Errors\n- NORTHWEST is not a valid direction - use only cardinal directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- When placing inserters, ensure the pickup and drop positions are clear and accessible\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure burner devices have fuel (multiple mining drills are out of fuel)\n- Monitor ingredient availability for assembling machines to maintain production\n\n### Placement Strategy\n- When building production lines, plan the layout considering the space needed for input/output systems\n- Leave adequate space between components to allow for inserters and belts\n- Consider using different spacing values when initial placement attempts fail due to conflicts"}
