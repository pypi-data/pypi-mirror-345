Previous attempts involved fluid_system IDs [66014, 66098, 66180, 66264, 66346, 66430, 66512, 66596, 66678, 66762, 66844, 66928, 67010, 67094, 67176, 67260] and [67342, 67426, 67508, 67592, 67674, 67758, 67840, 67924]. New attempts with candidate pipe groups having fluid_system IDs [68006, 68090, 68172, 68256, 68338, 68422, 68504] within a 10- to 15-tile radius of Position(x=-5.5, y=19.5) also returned no candidates. Consider expanding the search radius or revising the fluid system configuration on pipeline entities.\n\n\u2022 Boiler Fuel Supply Management:\n  - Monitor fuel levels diligently and replenish boiler fuel promptly to prevent operational shutdown.\n\n\u2022 General Connection Strategies:\n  - Assess environmental constraints and verify inventory levels before executing repositioning or pipeline attachment actions."}
