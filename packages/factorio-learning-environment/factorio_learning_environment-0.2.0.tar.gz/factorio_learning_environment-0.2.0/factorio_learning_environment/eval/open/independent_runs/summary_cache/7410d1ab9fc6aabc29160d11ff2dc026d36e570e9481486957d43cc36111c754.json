{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, starting from position (21.5, -10.5) and ending at (20.5, -5.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (24.5, -7.5), (24.5, -6.5), and (22.5, -4.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, producing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, producing copper plates\n- Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) intended to move items from the furnace\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (10.5, 0.5) set to produce copper cables\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (11.5, -1.5), (10.5, -1.5), (12.5, 1.5), (12.5, 0.5), and (10.5, 2.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (8.5, 0.5) for storing materials\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-11.0, 20.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, 18.5) for storing extracted iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Mining at Position (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, 20.0) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (19.5, 18.5) for storing extracted copper ore\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, including (10.5, 4.5) to (10.5, 6.5) and (9.5, 6.5) to (7.5, 6.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts\n- Ensure that belts are connected using inserters when transitioning from a stone furnace. Direct connections are not possible.\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters\n- Verify that the intended position for placing an inserter is not already occupied. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid conflicts."}
