{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal, currently smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) extracting items from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the wooden chest to the second burner inserter, consisting of 2 belts running from (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to the end wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied\n- Ensure there is enough space and no other entities occupy the intended position before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting spacing or changing the reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to a chest.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory resources\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to place or craft. Gather necessary resources like wood for crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Verify you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity."}
