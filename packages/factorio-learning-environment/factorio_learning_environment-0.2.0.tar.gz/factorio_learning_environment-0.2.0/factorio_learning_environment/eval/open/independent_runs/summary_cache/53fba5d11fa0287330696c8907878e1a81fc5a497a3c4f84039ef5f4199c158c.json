{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0) with status WORKING. It processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) with status WORKING. It processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, indicating it is not currently processing due to lack of iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with status WORKING. It extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Additional **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) frequently reports that the chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5) is full. Ensure to regularly empty this chest to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- The furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) is not operational due to lack of ingredients. Regularly supply iron ore to this furnace to ensure it remains productive.\n\n### Furnace Result Full Warning\n- Occasionally, the furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) indicates that its result inventory is full. Regularly extract iron plates from this furnace to prevent production halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Variables:**\n  - `wooden-chest`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs."}
