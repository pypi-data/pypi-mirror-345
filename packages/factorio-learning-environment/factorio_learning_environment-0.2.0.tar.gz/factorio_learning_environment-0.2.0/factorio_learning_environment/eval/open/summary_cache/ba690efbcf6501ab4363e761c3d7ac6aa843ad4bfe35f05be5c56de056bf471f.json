{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-6.0, -0.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-2.5, -0.5)\n- Connected by a PipeGroup with pipes at positions [(-7.5, -2.5), (-6.5, -2.5), (-8.5, -0.5), (-7.5, -0.5), (-7.5, -1.5)]\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at Positions (15.5, 70.5) and (18.5, 70.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric Mining Drill at position (15.5, 70.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (15.5, 72.5)\n- Electric Mining Drill at position (18.5, 70.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 72.5)\n- Both drills are powered by an Electricity Group with poles at positions [(18.5, 20.5), (20.5, 22.5), (22.5, 24.5), ..., (25.5, 69.5), (13.5, 71.5), (23.5, 71.5)]\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Facility at Position (19.5, 77.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling Machine at position (19.5, 77.5) set to produce iron gear wheels\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 77.5) to feed iron plates into the assembler\n- Wooden Chest at position (21.5, 77.5) to collect iron gear wheels\n- Connected to the power network with small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities at Occupied Positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is not occupied by another entity. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or altering the reference position.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Production\n- Verify that all necessary ingredients are available for production. Ensure that inserters are operational and feeding the correct items into the machines.\n\n### Errors when Asserting Inserter Operation\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned and powered to operate. Verify that they are not in a waiting state due to lack of source items.\n\n### Errors when Asserting Assembler Output\n- Check that the assembler has all required resources and is connected to the power network. Ensure that the recipe is set correctly and that the input inventory is not empty.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Unplaceable Terrain\n- Verify that the target location for placing an entity is suitable and not obstructed by unplaceable terrain like water.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions Defined by the Agent\n- `get_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any`: Retrieves an entity at a given position.\n- `rotate_entity(entity: Any, direction: Any) -> Any`: Rotates an entity in the specified direction.\n- `pickup_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any`: Picks up an entity from a given position.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `power_source_position`: Position of the nearest power source.\n- `pipes_to_steam_engine`: Connection status between boiler and steam engine using pipes.\n- `chest_1`: Instance of a wooden chest placed to collect resources."}
