{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis facility is responsible for processing iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest. It is currently out of fuel and has a warning to empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore. It contains 7 units of iron ore and 14 units of iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which is aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which receives iron ore from the inserter and smelts it into iron plates. It is currently working with a fuel inventory of 4 units of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Refueling and Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all machines, such as the burner mining drill and inserter, are adequately refueled with coal. Regularly check fuel levels to prevent interruptions in operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Operation\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned and operational to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Ensure that it is not waiting for source items and is properly fueled.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Avoid letting the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) become full to prevent mining operations from halting. Regularly extract items from the chest to maintain space for new resources.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is consistently receiving iron ore and is properly fueled to maintain continuous production of iron plates. Regularly check the setup to ensure smooth operation."}
