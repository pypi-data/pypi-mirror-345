{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5), extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0), receiving iron ore from the Burner Mining Drill and converting it into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Moving Stone Furnace\n- Ensure the target position for moving the Stone Furnace is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move it. The furnace cannot be moved to a position where no entity of type stone-furnace is found.\n\n### Errors when Placing Wooden Chest\n- Verify that the target location for placing the Wooden Chest is not already occupied by another entity or item. Ensure there is enough space for placement.\n\n### Errors when Placing Transport Belt\n- Confirm that the desired location for placing the Transport Belt is clear and suitable for placement. Avoid attempting to place belts in occupied or invalid tiles.\n\n### Errors when Placing Burner Inserter\n- Ensure the location for placing the Burner Inserter is valid and unoccupied. Check for any obstructions that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors with Drill's Drop Position\n- Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to prevent blockage. Ensure there is a sink entity or storage to accept the output from the drill to avoid warnings and inefficiencies."}
