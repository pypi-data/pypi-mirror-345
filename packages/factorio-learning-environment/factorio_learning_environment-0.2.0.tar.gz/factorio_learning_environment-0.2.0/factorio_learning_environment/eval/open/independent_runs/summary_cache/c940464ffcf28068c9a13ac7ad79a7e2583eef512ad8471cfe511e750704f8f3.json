{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52, -82)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring items from the Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) to another Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12, -51)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring items to the Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-8.5, -48.5) and (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (chests or belts) have items available for the inserters to pick up. Check for blockages or ensure that the source entities are being replenished with items.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty chests that are connected to mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Consider using inserters to automatically transfer items from full chests to other storage or processing units.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to process. This can be achieved by setting up a reliable logistics system that keeps furnaces stocked with necessary ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
