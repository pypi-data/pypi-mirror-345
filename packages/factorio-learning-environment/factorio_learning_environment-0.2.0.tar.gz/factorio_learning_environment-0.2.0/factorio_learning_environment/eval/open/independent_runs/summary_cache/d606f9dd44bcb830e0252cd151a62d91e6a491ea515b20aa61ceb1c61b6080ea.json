Repeated errors across Steps 210, 211, 213, 214, 215, 216, and 217 indicate that the target must be a valid inserter (or an appropriate intermediary) rather than a steam engine.\n  \n\u2022 When placing entities such as the wooden chest, ensure the target position is within the allowed range and that the required item is present in the inventory. Errors reported for placement at (3.5,15.5) (due to distance and missing item) emphasize the need to verify proximity and inventory content.\n  \n\u2022 Undefined variable errors (for example, the NameError for \u2018target_chest\u2019) highlight the importance of checking that all variable names are defined and correctly referenced before use."}
