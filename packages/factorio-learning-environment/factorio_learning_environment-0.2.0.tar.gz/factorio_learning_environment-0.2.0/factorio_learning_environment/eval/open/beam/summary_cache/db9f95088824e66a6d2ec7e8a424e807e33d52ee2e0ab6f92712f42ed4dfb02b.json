{"content": "The error message indicates that the furnace's inventory is full when attempting to insert coal, even though the inventory appears empty after extraction. This suggests that there might be a misunderstanding about how the inventory is being managed or displayed.\n\nHere's a revised approach to handle this situation:\n\n1. **Check Inventory Slots Properly**: Ensure that the furnace's inventory is truly empty by checking the specific slots available for each item type.\n2. **Insert Items in Correct Order**: Make sure to insert items in a way that respects the furnace's inventory constraints.\n\nLet's adjust the code:\n\n```python\n# Move to the furnace position\nmove_to(furnace_position)\n\n# Extract all contents from the furnace\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nfor item_type, quantity in furnace_inventory.items():\n    prototype = prototype_by_name[item_type]  # Convert string to Prototype\n    if quantity > 0:\n        extract_item(prototype, furnace_entity.position, quantity=quantity)\n\n# Verify that the furnace inventory is empty\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(\"Furnace cleared and rechecked: \", furnace_inventory)\n\n# Ensure the furnace is indeed empty\nassert len(furnace_inventory) == 0, \"Furnace clearing step: Expected no contents remaining.\"\n\n# Insert Iron Ore first to ensure space is managed\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace_entity, quantity=5)\n\n# Re-inspect inventory to determine available slots\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\ncurrent_slot_usage = sum(furnace_inventory.values())\n\nmax_capacity = 5\navailable_slots = max_capacity - current_slot_usage\n\n# Insert coal only if there is space available\nif available_slots > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace_entity, quantity=1)\nelse:\n    print(\"No available slots for coal insertion.\")\n\n# Allow time for processing\nsleep(10)\n\n# Check for smelted products\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(\"Post-Procedure Status: \", furnace_inventory)\n\n# Extract iron plates if they exist\nif furnace_inventory.get(\"iron-plate\", 0) > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace_entity.position, quantity=furnace_inventory.get(\"iron-plate\", 0))\n\n# Prepare for Offshore Pump crafting\nneeded_resources = {\n    Prototype.IronPlate: 10,\n    Prototype.CopperCable: 10,\n    Prototype.ElectronicCircuit: 5,\n}\n\n# Verify crafting materials inventory\nmy_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nfor proto, required in needed_resources.items():\n    available = my_inventory.get(proto.value[0], 0)\n    to_craft = max(0, required - available)\n    if to_craft > 0:\n        craft_item(proto, quantity=to_craft)\n\n# Craft the Offshore Pump when supplies are adequate\ncraft_item(Prototype.OffshorePump, quantity=1)\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n- **Inventory Check**: After extraction, ensure the inventory is truly empty by checking the length of the dictionary.\n- **Order of Insertion**: Insert iron ore first to ensure there is space for coal.\n- **Slot Management**: Calculate available slots before attempting to insert coal.\n- **Debugging Prints**: Use print statements to track the inventory state at different stages for better debugging.\n\nThese changes should help manage the furnace inventory more effectively and prevent errors related to inventory being full.", "summary_range": "[1-100]"}
