{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully established. Multiple attempts were made to deploy a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) to serve as a research facility for supplying Automation Science Packs; however, placement and crafting of the Lab failed due to inventory shortages and missing required sub-ingredients. Although existing furnaces (an iron smelting furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were retrieved for smelting operations, no new agent\u2010constructed structures are present on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Mismatch in get_entities Calls\n  \u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and using excess positional arguments. Always match the function\u2019s defined parameter signature.\n  \n\u2022 Handling None Returns from Entity Retrieval\n  \u2013 Check for a None value before iterating over the result from get_entities. Use a fallback (for example, an empty list) to prevent \u201cNoneType object is not iterable\u201d errors.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n  \u2013 Confirm the Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  \u2013 Ensure that all prerequisite materials (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, etc.) are produced in sufficient quantities prior to crafting a Lab.\n  \n\u2022 Resource Insufficiency for Complex Recipes\n  \u2013 Strengthen the resource production pipeline so that raw materials (iron-plate, copper-plate, etc.) and intermediate components are available to meet the requirements for advanced crafting recipes such as the Lab."}
