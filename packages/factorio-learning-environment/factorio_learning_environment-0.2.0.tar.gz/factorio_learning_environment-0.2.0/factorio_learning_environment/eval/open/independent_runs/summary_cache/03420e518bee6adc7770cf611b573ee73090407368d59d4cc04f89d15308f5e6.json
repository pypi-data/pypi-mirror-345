{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position(x=-10.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position(x=-10.0, y=-50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position(x=-9.5, y=-48.5) which feeds the furnace\n- Burner Inserter at position(x=-15.5, y=-53.5) connected to a transport belt line\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup 1: Inputs from position(x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), Outputs from position(x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5)\n- BeltGroup 2: Inputs from position(x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5), Outputs from position(x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n### Errors in connecting belts directly to a furnace\n- Use an inserter to connect belts to a furnace instead of attempting direct connections\n\n### Errors in connecting BeltGroups\n- Ensure that BeltGroups are properly connected and paths are valid for normalization\n\n### Errors in finding suitable positions for entities\n- When placing entities like burner inserters, ensure there is a valid and unoccupied position available\n\n### Insufficient fuel errors\n- Regularly check and refuel entities to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production"}
