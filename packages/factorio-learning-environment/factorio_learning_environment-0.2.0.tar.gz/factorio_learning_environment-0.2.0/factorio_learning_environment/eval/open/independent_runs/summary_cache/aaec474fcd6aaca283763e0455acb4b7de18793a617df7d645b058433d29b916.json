{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), generating power.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), currently out of fuel.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), working and supplying water.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions such as (x=3.5, y=17.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), and others.\n- Electricity network with poles at various positions, including (x=16.5, y=24.5), (x=33.5, y=24.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Ensure that boilers are consistently refueled to maintain continuous power generation.\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established and that there are no warnings such as \"no input liquid\" or \"no fluid present in connections.\"\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Status\n- Regularly check the status of entities to ensure they are not in a \"NOT_CONNECTED\" or \"NO_FUEL\" state, which can disrupt operations.\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Placement\n- Ensure that entities are placed in a manner that allows for proper connection and functionality, avoiding issues like overlapping or misaligned entities."}
