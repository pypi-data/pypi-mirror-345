{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production (Position 0,0 and 2,0)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing iron plates:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0) with coal fuel (14), processing iron ore (5) into iron plates (3)\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) with coal fuel (14), processing iron ore (6) into iron plates (3)\nBoth furnaces are actively working\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position 4,4 and 6,4)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing copper plates:\n- Furnace 3 at (4,4) with coal fuel (20), processing copper ore (7) into copper plates (3)\n- Furnace 4 at (6,4) with coal fuel (20), processing copper ore (7) into copper plates (3)\nBoth furnaces are actively working\n\n### Power Generation System (Position -7.5, 18.5)\nComplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Steam engine at (-7.5, 18.5), currently not receiving electricity and no input liquid\n- Boiler at (-7.5, 22.0), currently out of fuel, containing water (200)\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5), working status, containing water (100)\n- Connected pipe groups:\n  - Empty pipes at (-7.5, 15.5)\n  - Empty pipes at (-7.5, 20.5)\n  - Water pipes at (-8.5, 23.5)\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nExtensive power pole network operating at 2232kV, connecting multiple areas including poles at:\n- (-2.5, 6.5), (-2.5, 5.5), (-0.5, 5.5)\n- (4.5, 15.5), (1.5, 17.5), (1.5, 5.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Research and Technology Issues\n- Use correct technology names: 'logistic-science-pack' instead of 'LogisticSciencePack'\n- Check if technology is already researched before attempting to research it again\n- Verify technology prerequisites and required science packs before researching\n\n### Lab Location and Access Issues\n- Lab positions are not being found correctly despite extensive searching near power poles\n- Implement better lab discovery mechanism as current search patterns are not finding any labs\n- Consider expanding search radius or implementing different search patterns\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler - currently running out of fuel frequently\n- Maintain consistent fuel supply to prevent power generation interruptions\n- Ensure proper resource distribution between furnaces and boiler\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Errors\n- Use correct prototype names for recipes (e.g., 'logistic-science-pack' instead of 'LogisticsSciencePack')\n- Verify recipe existence before attempting to craft items\n- Check if required technologies are researched before attempting to craft advanced items\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Steam engine is not receiving electricity or liquid input\n- Ensure proper connection between boiler and steam engine\n- Maintain consistent fuel supply in boiler to keep power generation stable"}
