{"content": "I apologize for my confusion in the previous attempts. Let me analyze what's actually happening:\n\n1. Looking at our inventory, we actually don't have any stone at all. I was incorrect in assuming we had stone.\n2. We need to:\n   - Find stone resources\n   - Mine stone\n   - Craft a stone furnace\n   \nLet's try this approach:\n\n```python\n# First find and mine some stone\nstone_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nprint(f\"Found stone at: {stone_position}\")\n\n# Move to the stone\nmove_to(stone_position)\nprint(\"Moved to stone position\")\n\n# Mine the stone (we need at least 5 for a furnace)\nmine(stone_position)\nprint(\"Mining stone...\")\n\n# Check our updated inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Inventory after mining stone: {inventory}\")\n\n# Now try to craft the stone furnace\nif inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0) >= 5:\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\n    print(\"Crafted stone furnace\")\n    \n    # Check if we can now craft the burner mining drill\n    inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    if (inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 3 and \n        inventory.get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0) >= 3 and \n        inventory.get(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 0) >= 1):\n        craft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\n        print(\"Successfully crafted burner mining drill\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Not enough stone. Have: {inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0)}, need: 5\")\n\n# Final inventory check\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {final_inventory}\")\n```\n\nThis script should:\n1. Find the nearest stone resource\n2. Move to it\n3. Mine it to get stone\n4. Once we have enough stone, craft a stone furnace\n5. Then attempt to craft the burner mining drill if we have all required materials\n\nLet's see if this approach works better.", "summary_range": "[1-2442]"}
