# directed_graph

A directed graph is a [graph](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/graph.md) in which the [edges](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/edge.md) have a direction. Each edge connects an ordered pair of [nodes](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/node.md), meaning that the connection goes from one node to another in a specific direction.
