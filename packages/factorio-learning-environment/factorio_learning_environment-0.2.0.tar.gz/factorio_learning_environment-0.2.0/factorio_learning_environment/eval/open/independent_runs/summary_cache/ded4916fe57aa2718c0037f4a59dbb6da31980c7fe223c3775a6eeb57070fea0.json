{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, actively working with no ingredients to smelt, and 7 iron plates in the result.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5), fueled by coal, currently waiting for source items. It picks up from position (-2.5, 0.5) and drops at position (-0.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) containing 50 iron plates.\n- **Belt Group** connecting positions (-0.5, 1.5) to (1.5, 1.5) and (1.5, 0.5) to (1.5, -1.5), consisting of 4 belts, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target position is free before placing an entity. If an error occurs indicating an entity already exists at the target position, remove the obstructing entity first.\n\n### Inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure there is space in the destination for the inserter to drop items. Place a sink object at the specified drop position to prevent the inserter from being blocked.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source supply is adequate for the inserter to function. Check input supply to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter positions\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Realign the inserter if misalignment is detected to ensure smooth operation.\n\n### Repeated Errors with Transport Belt Placement\n- Avoid attempting to place a transport belt on a tile where one already exists. Always check for existing entities at the target position before placement to prevent errors and unnecessary removal actions.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Type in Function Calls\n- Ensure that function arguments match the expected types. For instance, when using `insert_item`, ensure the second argument is an `Entity` or `EntityGroup`, not a `Position`.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Verify that all entities involved in connections are correctly initialized and not `NoneType`. Ensure that the entities have the required attributes before attempting to connect them."}
