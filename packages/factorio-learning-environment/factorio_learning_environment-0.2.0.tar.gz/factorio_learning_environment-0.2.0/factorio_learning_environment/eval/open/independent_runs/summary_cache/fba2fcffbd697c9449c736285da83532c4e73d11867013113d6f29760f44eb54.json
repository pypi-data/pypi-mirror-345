{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', currently not connected.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a status of 'no fuel', connected to a series of pipes.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) currently working, providing water to the fluid system.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), status 'empty', connecting various points.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=21.5), status 'empty', connecting various points.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=2.5, y=21.5), status 'empty', connecting various points.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status 'full output', transporting water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with id 40701, consisting of poles at various positions, currently with 0 voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes to steam engine\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are correctly aligned and that there are no gaps between the boiler's steam output point and the steam engine. Verify that the correct types of pipes are being used and that they are placed at the correct positions.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in the boiler\n- Regularly check the fuel status of the boiler and ensure it is refueled to maintain the operation of the electricity generator.\n\n### Errors due to no input liquid in steam engine\n- Verify that the offshore pump is operational and that the water is being correctly transported through the pipe network to the steam engine.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect entities using specified prototypes. Failure occurs if the connection path is blocked or if incompatible entities are specified.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of pipes intended to connect the boiler's steam output to the steam engine.\n- `inventory`: Dictionary containing the current inventory of items such as 'pipe', 'boiler', and 'offshore-pump'."}
