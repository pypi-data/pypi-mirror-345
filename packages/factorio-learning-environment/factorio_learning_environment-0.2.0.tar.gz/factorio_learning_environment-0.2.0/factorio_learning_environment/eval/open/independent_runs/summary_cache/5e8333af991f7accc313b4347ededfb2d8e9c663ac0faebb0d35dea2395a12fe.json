{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) with iron plates ready for extraction.\n- Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with iron plates ready for extraction.\n- Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with iron plates ready for extraction.\n- Burner inserters at positions (-17.5, -47.5), (-15.5, -47.5), and (-13.5, -47.5) oriented to feed the furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), and (-12.5, -45.5) oriented to transfer iron plates from the wooden chest to the iron chest.\n- Iron chest at position (-12.5, -44.5) receiving iron plates.\n\n### Coal Supply System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner inserters at positions (-14.5, -43.5), (-12.5, -43.5), and (-13.5, -43.5) oriented to supply coal to various structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly oriented and fueled to avoid waiting for source items or space in the destination. Reorient inserters if necessary.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts\n- Avoid attempting to connect transport belts directly to chests or inserters. Use inserters to input or output items between belts and other entities.\n- Ensure there is sufficient space to place transport belts and avoid overlapping with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with inventory management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities to avoid errors related to missing items.\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target tile is occupied to prevent placement errors. Adjust spacing or change the direction if necessary."}
