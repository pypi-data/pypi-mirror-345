{"content": "Here is the report based on the execution logs:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Station at (6.0, -60.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, -60.0) used for smelting iron plates\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (40.0, -85.0) \nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (40.0, -85.0) mining coal\n- Self-fueling burner inserter at (40.5, -83.5) that takes coal from the drill\n- The inserter is configured to pick up from (40.5, -82.5) and drop at (40.5, -84.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Crafting dependency errors\n- Before crafting complex items like burner mining drills, ensure you have all required base materials (iron plates, stone, etc.)\n- Create intermediate items like iron gear wheels before attempting to craft more complex items\n- For items requiring iron plates, ensure you have a functioning smelting setup first\n\n### Resource gathering requirements\n- Stone furnaces require raw stone which must be gathered, not crafted\n- Iron plates require a furnace to smelt iron ore, cannot be crafted directly\n\n### Placement errors\n- Ensure you have the required item in inventory before attempting to place it\n- Verify the target position is valid and free before placing entities\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drill`: BurnerMiningDrill\n- `furnace`: Furnace\n\n### Functions Used\n- `craft_item(prototype: Prototype, quantity: int)`: Attempts to craft specified quantity of an item\n- `place_entity()`: Places an entity at specified coordinates\n- `harvest()`: Collects resources from the map\n- `extract()`: Removes items from entities like furnaces\n\nSuccess patterns:\n- Basic resource gathering (coal, iron ore, stone) works consistently\n- Furnace placement and operation successful\n- Self-fueling mining setup established successfully\n\nFailure patterns:\n- Attempting to craft complex items without prerequisites\n- Trying to craft items that must be smelted or gathered"}
