{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n    - Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Drop Position: (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore\n\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: Working\n    - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n    - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (4 units)\n    - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (20 units)\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: Working\n    - Fuel: Coal (10 units)\n    - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (1 unit)\n    - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (1 unit)\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n    - Status: No Ingredients\n    - Fuel: Coal (18 units)\n    - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (15 units)\n    - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n### Storage\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Chest at position (4.5, -58.5)\n    - Inventory: Iron Ore (7 units)\n  - Additional empty chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from halting due to a full drop position.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Regularly supply iron ore to the furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) to maintain continuous production.\n- Consider automating the supply chain to prevent manual intervention.\n\n### Full Furnace Output\n- Regularly extract iron plates from furnaces to prevent them from halting due to full output inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined by the agent.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n  - `coal`: int = 5\n  - `iron-plate`: int = 5090\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int = 4\n\nNo utility functions have been invoked or defined, and no additional variables have been assigned beyond inventory tracking."}
