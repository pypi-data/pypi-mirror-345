{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing entities or items on the ground.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence and correct positioning of entities before attempting interactions, such as extraction or placement.\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or appropriate infrastructure to accept outputs from production entities to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors with insufficient ingredients\n- Regularly check and supply necessary ingredients to production entities like furnaces to maintain continuous operation."}
