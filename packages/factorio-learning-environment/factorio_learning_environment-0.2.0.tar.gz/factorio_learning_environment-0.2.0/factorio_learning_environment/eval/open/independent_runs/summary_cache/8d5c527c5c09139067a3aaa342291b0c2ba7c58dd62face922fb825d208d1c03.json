{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5)\n- Boiler (position -11.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe groups connecting these entities:\n  - Pipe group (position -13.5, 20.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe group (position -9.5, 21.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT\n  - Pipe group (position -11.5, 23.5) - Status: EMPTY\n- Electricity group (position -11.7, 24.3) - Status: WORKING\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when reconnecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that the pipes are placed correctly and there are no obstructions between the boiler and steam engine. Check the positions to ensure they are aligned.\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Verify that the connection points for the offshore pump and boiler are accessible and correctly positioned. Ensure there are no other entities blocking the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
