The agent attempted to place various entities, but all attempts resulted in errors or were not recorded as successful placements. As a result, there are no existing structures to report at this time.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place a Wooden Chest**: Ensure that the target location is not occupied by another entity or terrain feature before attempting to place a wooden chest. Attempted placements at positions such as x=100.0 y=-150.0, x=0.0 y=10.0, and x=10.0 y=0.0 were unsuccessful.\n  \n- **Cannot place a Transport Belt**: Verify that the path for the transport belt is clear and that there are no obstructions at the intended placement location. The attempt to place a transport belt at x=65.0 y=-105.0 failed.\n\n- **Cannot place a Stone Furnace**: Check that the area where you want to place the stone furnace is clear of any obstructions or existing entities. The placement attempt at x=5.0 y=5.0 was unsuccessful.\n\n- **Cannot place a Burner Inserter**: Ensure the target tile is free from any other entities or obstacles before placing a burner inserter. The attempt to place it at x=-50.0 y=50.0 failed.\n\nTo avoid these errors, always verify that the target location is suitable for placing the desired entity and that there are no conflicts with existing map features or entities."}
