This includes stone furnaces, burner mining drills, and wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Verify that all necessary sub-ingredients are available before crafting an item. For example, ensure sufficient iron plates for crafting burner mining drills and gather raw resources like wood for crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Errors due to missing items for insertion\n- Check the inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into entities. For instance, ensure availability of coal before inserting into a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors related to entity status and functionality\n- Ensure that entities like burner mining drills are functioning correctly by checking their status and resolving any issues, such as ensuring there is space in the destination for mined resources.\n\n### Errors when using assertions without verifying conditions\n- Before asserting the status of an entity, confirm that all conditions for its operation are met, such as ensuring the burner mining drill is working by providing necessary fuel and output space.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. Ensure that the distance between the player and the target position is within the allowable range.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without having the required items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items, such as transport belts, in your inventory before attempting to connect entities.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without a crafting machine\n- Some items require a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace. Ensure that you have access to the necessary equipment for crafting these items.\n\n### Errors when extracting items with incorrect conditions\n- Ensure that the quantity of items to be extracted is greater than zero and that the entity has produced the required items before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that the items you wish to insert are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors when inserter alignment is incorrect\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities to facilitate item transfer. Adjust the inserter's position if necessary.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient fuel in entities\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel in entities like burner mining drills and inserters to maintain their operational status."}
