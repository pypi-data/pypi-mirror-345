Ensure that the candidate settings match the actual fluid_system (106518) available in the pipeline network.\n- Consistency in Pipeline Network Parameters:\n  - Verify uniformity of fluid_system identifiers across the boiler, offshore pump, and all pipe groups. Mismatched identifiers prevent successful connection.\n- Inventory Attribute Usage:\n  - Rely solely on supported inventory attributes when accessing or modifying inventory items to avoid attribute-related errors."}
