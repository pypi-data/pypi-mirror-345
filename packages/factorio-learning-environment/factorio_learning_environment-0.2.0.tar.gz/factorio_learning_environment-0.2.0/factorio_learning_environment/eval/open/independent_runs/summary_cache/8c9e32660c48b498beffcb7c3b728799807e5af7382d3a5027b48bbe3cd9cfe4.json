{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) with fuel (coal: 6), currently waiting for space in destination due to output blockage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) with fuel (coal: 50), waiting for source items due to full chest.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with fuel (coal: 3), actively working with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Transport Belts** aligned correctly at positions (x=43.5, y=-82.5), (x=43.5, y=-80.5), and (x=43.5, y=-79.5).\n- **BeltGroup** with inputs from (x=42.5, y=-82.5) to (x=44.5, y=-82.5) and (x=43.5, y=-81.5) to (x=43.5, y=-79.5), outputs from (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=42.5, y=-79.5), currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drill\n- Ensure that the output path of the Burner Mining Drill is clear and connected to a valid sink entity to prevent blockage.\n\n### Full Chest Warning in Inserter\n- Regularly check and clear the output chest or connect it to a transport system to prevent the inserter from halting due to a full chest.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
