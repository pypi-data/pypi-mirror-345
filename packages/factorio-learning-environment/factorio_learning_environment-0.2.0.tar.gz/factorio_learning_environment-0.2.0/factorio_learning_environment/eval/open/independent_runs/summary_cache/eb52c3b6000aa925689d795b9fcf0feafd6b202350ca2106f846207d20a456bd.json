{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (x=-6.5, y=0.0) - currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine (x=-2.5, y=0.5) - now connected to power network\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - now receiving electricity\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - now receiving electricity, set to BasicOilProcessing recipe\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - contains petroleum gas\n- Chemical plant (x=37.5, y=40.5) - now receiving electricity, set to PlasticBar recipe\n- Wooden chest with coal (x=37.5, y=37.5)\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - still not receiving electricity, connects chest to chemical plant\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Failed to connect power pole to inserter at x=37.5 y=38.5:\n  - Ensure power poles are within connection range (7.5 tiles for small electric poles)\n  - Verify no obstructions between power pole and inserter\n\n### Inserter operation problems\n- Inserter at x=37.5 y=38.5 has warning \"output blocked by item on the ground\":\n  - Clear any items blocking the inserter's drop position\n  - Verify chemical plant can accept items at drop position (x=37.5 y=39.5)\n\n### Chemical plant issues\n- Chemical plant at x=37.5 y=40.5 shows FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE:\n  - Verify petroleum gas supply is connected and flowing\n  - Check pipe connections to chemical plant's input (x=38.5 y=42.0)\n\n### Previous errors still applicable:\n- Incorrect prototype naming (PumpJack vs Pumpjack)\n- Entity connection errors (set recipes before pipes)\n- Fluid system issues (verify source entities have fluid)\n- Fuel management (boiler at x=-6.5 y=0.0 still needs fuel)\n- Entity inspection (verify inventory before inspection)\n- Production verification (check EntityStatus.WORKING)"}
