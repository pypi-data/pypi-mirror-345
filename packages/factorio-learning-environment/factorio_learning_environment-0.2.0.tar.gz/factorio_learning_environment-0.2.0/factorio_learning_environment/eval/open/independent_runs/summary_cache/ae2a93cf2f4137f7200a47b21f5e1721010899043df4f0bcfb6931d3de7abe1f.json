{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position (8.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear inserter at position (6.5, 13.5)\n- Output inserter at position (10.5, 13.5)\n- Output wooden chest at position (11.5, 13.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n- Small electric pole at position (8.5, 15.5) providing power\n\n### Electricity Generation System (around x=-4.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected pipe network for water/steam transport\n- Electric pole network connecting to production facilities\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining/smelting setups at various locations:\n1. Setup at x=41, y=-82:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n2. Setup at x=-28, y=-61:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n3. Setup at x=-18, y=-53:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - multiple attempts to place chests and inserters where other entities already exist\n- When placing entities next to each other, verify the spacing parameter is appropriate for the available space\n- Consider the full dimensions of buildings (especially multi-tile ones like assembling machines) when planning placement\n\n### Direction and Positioning Issues\n- When placing inserters, ensure the pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the intended source and destination\n- Consider alternative directions when the default placement direction results in conflicts\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure mining drills have fuel before operation - multiple drills are inactive due to lack of fuel\n- Keep furnaces stocked with both fuel and ingredients to maintain production\n\n### Infrastructure Planning\n- Plan the layout of production lines considering the space needed for all components (inserters, chests, belts)\n- Leave adequate space between production structures to allow for inserters and transport systems"}
