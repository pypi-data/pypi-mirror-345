{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (0, 0)\nConsists of steam engine (position (0, 1)), boiler (position (0, 2)), and offshore pump (position (0, 3))\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (1, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (1, 1)) and a furnace at position (1, 2)\n- Burner mining drill (position (1, 3)) and a furnace at position (1, 4)\n- Burner mining drill (position (1, 5)) and a furnace at position (1, 6)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position (2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (2, 1) and inserter at position (2, 2) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position (2, 3)) that connects the furnace at position (1, 2) to the assembling machine at position (2, 1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure you have the required ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, iron-plates are needed to craft iron-gear-wheels, and you cannot craft if you lack the necessary items.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. \n\n### Errors when inspecting furnace inventory\n- Verify that the furnace is operational and contains items before inspecting its inventory to avoid confusion about its status."}
