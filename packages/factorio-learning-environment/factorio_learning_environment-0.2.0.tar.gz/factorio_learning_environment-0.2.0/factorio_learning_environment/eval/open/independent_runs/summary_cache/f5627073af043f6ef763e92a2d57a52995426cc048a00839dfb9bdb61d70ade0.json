{"content": "Based on the logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Setup (around x=41, y=-82)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Connected to wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for coal collection\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage, both full with 1600 coal each\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around x=45-47, y=-81)\n- Two stone furnaces positioned at:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input chest for iron ore at (45.5, -79.5)\n- Output chest for iron plates at (49.5, -80.5)\n- Two burner inserters at:\n  - First inserter at (44.5, -79.5) moving items from (43.5, -79.5) to (45.5, -79.5)\n  - Second inserter at (46.5, -79.5) moving items from (45.5, -79.5) to (47.5, -79.5)\n\nAdditional storage:\n- Empty wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Multiple failed attempts to place burner inserters at occupied positions\n   - Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n   - Common failed positions: (45.0, -79.5), (45.5, -80.0), (45.0, -80.0), (44.5, -80.5)\n\n2. Production System Issues\n   - Furnaces are not receiving ingredients despite having fuel\n   - Ensure inserter placement and orientation properly feeds materials into furnaces\n   - Check if the material transport chain is properly connected\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- first_ore_inserter: Entity (burner-inserter)\n- second_ore_inserter: Entity (burner-inserter)\n\nSystem States:\n- Mining drill: Working state with coal fuel\n- Furnaces: NO_INGREDIENTS state with coal fuel\n- Storage chests: Various states of fullness (coal, iron ore, iron plates)"}
