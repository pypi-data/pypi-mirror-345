{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), currently working with energy 15000.0.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), fueled with coal and working with energy 2000.0.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), currently working with no energy consumption.\n- PipeGroup for steam, connecting various pipe positions from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n- PipeGroup for water, connecting various pipe positions from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n- Electricity network with poles positioned from (x=30.5, y=17.5) to (x=33.5, y=24.5).\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that all entities intended to be connected are within the valid range and properly aligned. In this case, the connection of a pipe to the steam engine failed. Verify the positions and compatibility of entities before attempting to connect them.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect two entities using a specified prototype, such as a pipe. Failure in connection may occur if entities are not aligned or within range.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: List of pipes intended for connection, type: list of `Pipe`.\n  - `steam_output_position`: Position intended for steam output, type: `Position`.\n  - `steam_engine_position`: Position of the steam engine, type: `Position`."}
