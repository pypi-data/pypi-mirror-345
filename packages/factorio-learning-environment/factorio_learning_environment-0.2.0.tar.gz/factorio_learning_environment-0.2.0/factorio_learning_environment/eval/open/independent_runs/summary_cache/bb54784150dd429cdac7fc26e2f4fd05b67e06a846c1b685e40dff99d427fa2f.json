{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, spanning positions from (-9.5, 23.5) to (1.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -59.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science pack input, but no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the target entity is capable of accepting the item type being inserted. For example, ensure that furnaces can accept copper plates before attempting to insert them.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities, such as ensuring coal is available before inserting into a boiler.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters, are connected to a power network and receiving electricity to function properly.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operations\n- Ensure that entities like furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate, such as ore for smelting."}
