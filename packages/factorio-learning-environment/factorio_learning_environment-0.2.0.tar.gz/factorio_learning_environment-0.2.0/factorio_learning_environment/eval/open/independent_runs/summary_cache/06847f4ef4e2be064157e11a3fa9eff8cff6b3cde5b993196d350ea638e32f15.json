{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (12 units)\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (26 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (80 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target location is free before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing entities or obstructions at the desired location.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied locations\n- Verify that the destination for moving an entity is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by checking the map for the presence of the entity type at the given coordinates.\n\n### Errors with incorrect API usage\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that all arguments are correctly specified and that no unexpected keyword arguments are used.\n- When using the `insert_item` function, ensure that the arguments provided match the expected types and that the function is called with the correct parameters.\n\n### Errors related to entity output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or another processing unit, to accept the output from entities like drills or furnaces, preventing blockage and ensuring continuous operation."}
