{"content": "The error indicates that there is no boiler in the inventory, which is necessary to continue setting up the power infrastructure. Let's address this by crafting a boiler and ensuring we have all the required components.\n\n### Steps to Craft and Place a Boiler:\n\n1. **Check Inventory for Required Materials:**\n   - A boiler typically requires iron plates and potentially other materials. Let's verify what we have and what we need.\n\n2. **Craft the Boiler:**\n   - Use available materials to craft a boiler.\n\n3. **Place the Boiler:**\n   - Once crafted, place the boiler adjacent to the offshore pump.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n#### Step 1: Check Inventory\n```python\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current Inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Check if we have enough iron plates and other materials\nrequired_iron_plates = 5  # Example quantity, adjust based on actual recipe\nif inventory.get('iron-plate', 0) < required_iron_plates:\n    print(\"Insufficient iron plates. Gather more iron plates.\")\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Craft the Boiler\n```python\n# Craft the boiler if materials are sufficient\ntry:\n    boiler_crafted = craft_item(Prototype.Boiler)\n    assert boiler_crafted >= 1, \"Failed to craft the Boiler.\"\n    print(\"Boiler crafted successfully.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error crafting the Boiler: {e}\")\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Place the Boiler\n```python\n# Move closer to the offshore pump for placement\nmove_to(nearest(Resource.Water))\n\n# Calculate the position for the boiler\nboiler_position = nearest(Resource.Water).right()\n\n# Place the boiler at the calculated position\ntry:\n    boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\n    assert boiler, \"Failed to place the Boiler.\"\n    print(\"Boiler placed successfully.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error placing the Boiler: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Final Steps:\n- After placing the boiler, ensure it is fueled with coal.\n- Connect the boiler to a steam engine and extend the power network to the assembling machine using small electric poles.\n\n### Tips:\n- Always ensure you have the necessary materials before attempting to craft.\n- Check the crafting recipes and ensure you have the correct technology unlocked if needed.\n- Move within range of the placement area to avoid distance errors.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to craft and place the boiler successfully, allowing you to set up the power infrastructure needed for your assembling machine.", "summary_range": "[1-148]"}
