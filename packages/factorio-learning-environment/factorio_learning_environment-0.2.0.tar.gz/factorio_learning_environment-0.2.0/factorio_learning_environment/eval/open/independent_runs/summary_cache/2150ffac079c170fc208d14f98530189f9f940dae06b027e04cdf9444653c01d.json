{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with coal fuel, connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal to:\n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing 76 units of coal\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) containing 762 units of coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Belt Conveyor System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5) and outputs from position (x=43.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transporting coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Configuration\n- Ensure that all inserters have a clear path to transfer items from their source to their destination. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that may prevent proper item transfer.\n\n### Errors in Resource Distribution\n- Verify that all chests and furnaces are receiving the necessary resources. Adjust the setup if any entity is not receiving the intended materials, such as coal or iron ore, to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement\n- Before placing entities, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended entity. This prevents misplacement and ensures efficient use of space.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities that require fuel, such as burner mining drills and furnaces, to prevent interruptions in production."}
