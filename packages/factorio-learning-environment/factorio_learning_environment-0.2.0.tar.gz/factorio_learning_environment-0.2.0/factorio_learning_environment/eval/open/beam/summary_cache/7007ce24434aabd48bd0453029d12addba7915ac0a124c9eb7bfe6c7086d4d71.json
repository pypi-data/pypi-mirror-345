{"content": "Ah, I see the core issue now - we don't have a burner mining drill in our inventory. Let's craft one first:\n\n```python\n# First, check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Craft a burner mining drill\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\nprint(\"Crafted burner mining drill\")\n\n# Find nearest iron ore patch\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Found iron ore at {iron_pos}\")\n\n# Move to iron ore location\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# Now place the mining drill\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=iron_pos,\n    direction=Direction.DOWN  # Output downwards\n)\n\nif drill:\n    print(f\"Placed mining drill at {drill.position}\")\n    # Add fuel to the drill\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n\n    # Place furnace below the drill's output\n    furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n        Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n        reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n        direction=Direction.DOWN,\n        spacing=1\n    )\n    \n    if furnace:\n        print(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n        # Add fuel to furnace\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n        # Add inserter between drill and furnace\n        inserter = place_entity_next_to(\n            Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n            reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n            direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n            spacing=1\n        )\n        \n        if inserter:\n            print(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n            # Rotate inserter to face from drill to furnace\n            rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.DOWN)\n            # Add fuel to inserter\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n            print(\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Current entities: {entities}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Craft the burner mining drill we need\n2. Place it on the iron ore patch\n3. Set up the furnace and inserter system\n4. Fuel everything properly\n\nLet me know if you see any other issues we need to address.", "summary_range": "[1-928]"}
