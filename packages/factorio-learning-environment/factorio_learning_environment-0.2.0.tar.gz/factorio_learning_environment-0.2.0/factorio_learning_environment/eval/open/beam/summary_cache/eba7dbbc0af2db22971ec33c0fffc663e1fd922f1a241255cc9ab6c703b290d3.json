This will allow me to smelt any iron ore I can gather later and potentially enable further crafting options.\n#\n# I will check the recipe for the Stone Furnace to confirm its requirements.\n\n# Getting the recipe for the Stone Furnace to see what items are needed for crafting it.\nstone_furnace_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.StoneFurnace)  # Retrieve recipe for the stone furnace.\n\n# Display the recipe details for the Stone Furnace.\nprint(f\"Stone Furnace Recipe: {stone_furnace_recipe}\")  # Output the recipe details.", "summary_range": "[1-182]"}
