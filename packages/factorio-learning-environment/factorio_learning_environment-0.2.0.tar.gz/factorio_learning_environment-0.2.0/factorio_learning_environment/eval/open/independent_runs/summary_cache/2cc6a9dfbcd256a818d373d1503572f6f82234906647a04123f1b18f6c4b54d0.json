{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Currently, this inserter is out of fuel and not functioning properly.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it is not receiving iron ore due to incorrect inserter setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and fueled to transfer items between entities. The inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) is not transferring iron ore to the furnace due to misalignment and lack of fuel. Regularly check the inserter's position and fuel status to ensure proper operation.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in all entities that require it, such as burner mining drills and inserters. Refuel them regularly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in your inventory. The error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" suggests a need to monitor inventory levels closely and harvest resources as needed."}
