{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=5.5, y=5.5)\n- Steam engine at position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (stone-furnace) at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (8.5, 1.5)\n- Lab at position (6.5, 1.5)\n- Chest (wooden-chest) at position (3.5, 1.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing the small electric pole is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that is unplaceable (e.g., water). \n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to access (e.g., steam engine) exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. If the entity has been removed or never existed, the retrieval will fail. \n\n### Repeated Errors\n- The errors related to placing electric poles and retrieving the steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0) have occurred multiple times across different steps. It is crucial to address these issues consistently to prevent ongoing failures."}
