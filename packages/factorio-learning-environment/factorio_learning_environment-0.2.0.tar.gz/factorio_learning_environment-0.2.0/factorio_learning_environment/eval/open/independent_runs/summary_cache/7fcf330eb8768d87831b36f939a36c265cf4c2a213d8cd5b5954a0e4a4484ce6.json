{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) and another Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) via Burner Inserters at positions (41.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -80.5).\n- Stone Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0) and Stone Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting the Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) to a storage system, facilitating coal transport.\n\n### Coal Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) storing coal.\n- BeltGroup facilitating the movement of coal between chests and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces, are regularly refueled to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Check that inserters have access to source items to avoid waiting states. Ensure that the source and destination entities are correctly aligned and stocked.\n\n### Errors with Ingredient Supply\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to prevent warnings about missing ingredients. Regularly check and supply iron ore to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement and Connectivity\n- Verify that all entities are correctly placed and connected to their intended neighbors to ensure seamless operation and resource flow."}
