{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with pipes at positions such as (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), and (-4.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions such as (-4.5, 16.5), (-5.5, 16.5), and (-2.5, 22.5)\n- Electricity Group with Small Electric Poles at positions (-7.5, 22.5), (-6.5, 22.5), and (-1.5, 20.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities, such as pipes or electric poles.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have enough resources, such as coal or pipes, before performing actions that require them.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and that the connection path is clear and valid.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that entities requiring fuel, such as boilers, have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and replenish fuel as needed.\n\n### Errors due to unpowered entities\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional power network. Check connections and ensure electric poles are properly placed and connected.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Entity Status\n- Regularly verify the status of critical entities like steam engines and ensure they are working as expected. If not, check connections and resource availability."}
