{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) and a series of transport belts for ore transportation.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and (-18.0, -70.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently, both furnaces have no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) for transferring items between belts and furnaces.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) for copper ore extraction and storage. The drill is currently out of fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) for transferring items between belts and chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items between chests.\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various mining drills, furnaces, and chests, facilitating the transportation of ores and plates across different facilities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using `connect_entities` with a Chest\n- Ensure that the objects you are trying to connect have the appropriate attributes. In this case, a 'Chest' object does not have an 'outputs' attribute. Consider revising the logic to handle connections appropriately for different entity types.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement."}
