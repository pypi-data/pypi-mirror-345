{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Unit at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) intended for smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure that the items you are trying to insert are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or unsuitable tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is not occupied by another entity or unsuitable for placement (e.g., water or collision with existing entities). Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and functionality\n- Make sure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly set and that the inserter is fueled to function properly.\n\n### Furnace not receiving iron ore\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the inserter is fueled and operational, and that there are no blockages or misalignments preventing the transfer of materials."}
