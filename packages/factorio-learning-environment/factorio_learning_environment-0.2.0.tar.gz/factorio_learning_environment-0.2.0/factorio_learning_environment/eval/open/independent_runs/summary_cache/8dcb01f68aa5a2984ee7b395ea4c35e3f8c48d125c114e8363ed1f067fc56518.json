{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned to pick up and drop items. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials between entities, as seen with the inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) which failed to transfer iron ore to the furnace.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt production processes, as observed with the mining drill and inserter requiring coal refueling.\n\n### Errors with Chest Capacity\n- Monitor the capacity of storage chests to prevent overflow. The wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) became full, which stopped the mining drill from operating efficiently. Ensure to empty or upgrade storage as needed.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the furnace has a consistent supply of ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) was not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or empty chests, leading to a halt in iron plate production."}
