{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo persistent structures have been successfully added to the map. Multiple attempts were made to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) \u2013 intended for supplying Automation Science Packs to research \u2013 but none succeeded due to recurring crafting and placement issues. Although the agent referenced existing furnace entities (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used for iron smelting and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production), no new structures have been created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval:\n\u2003\u2013 When using get_entities, avoid unsupported keyword parameters (such as 'radius') and extra positional arguments. Conform to the defined function signature.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate the return value of get_entities before iterating; if it may be None, implement a fallback to an empty list.\n\u2022 Lab crafting and placement issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper cables) are available before attempting to craft a Lab.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that a Lab has been successfully crafted and is present in the inventory prior to initiating any placement actions.\n\u2003\u2013 Review the full resource and production chain to prevent shortages that lead to subsequent crafting errors.\n\n"}
