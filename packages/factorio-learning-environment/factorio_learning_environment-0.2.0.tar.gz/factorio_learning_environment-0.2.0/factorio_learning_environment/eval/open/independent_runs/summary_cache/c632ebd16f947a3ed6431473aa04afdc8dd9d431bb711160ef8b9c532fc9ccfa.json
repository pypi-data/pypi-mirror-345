{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-52.5) for inserting iron ore into the furnace\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron ore from the mining drill\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) for mining iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-17.5, y=-50.5) for transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the chest\n\n#### Coal Mining Facility at position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-86.0) for mining coal\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=43.0, y=-86.0) for mining coal\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=43.5, y=-84.5) for storing coal\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-82.5) for storing coal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for transferring coal from the belt to the chest\n\n#### Additional Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) for inserting iron ore into the furnace\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces or mining drills.\n\n#### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly empty chests that are full to allow mining drills and other entities to continue functioning. For example, the chest at (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) is full, preventing the mining drill from dropping iron ore.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces are out of fuel or ingredients\n- Always check the fuel and input ingredients of furnaces to ensure they are operational. For example, the furnace at (x=-13.0, y=-50.0) is out of fuel and cannot smelt iron ore.\n\n#### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to the items they need to transfer. For example, the burner inserter at (x=43.5, y=-77.5) is waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are out of fuel\n- Ensure mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. For example, the mining drill at (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) is out of fuel and cannot mine iron ore."}
