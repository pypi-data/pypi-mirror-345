{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n\nThese furnaces are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. They have been consistently supplied with iron ore and have been extracting iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with warnings of being out of fuel and a full chest at the drop position\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) which is currently empty\n- Multiple additional chests positioned around the mining area, some of which are full of iron plates\n\nThis setup is intended for mining iron ore but is currently non-functional due to the lack of fuel in the mining drill and full chests preventing further mining.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when extracting iron ore from a chest\n- Ensure that the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore before attempting extraction. The repeated attempts to extract iron ore from an empty chest resulted in errors.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in mining operations. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Errors due to out of fuel in mining drills\n- Refill the burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with fuel to resume mining operations. The drill is currently out of fuel, halting the mining process.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `extracted_iron_ore`: Type: int, used to store the quantity of iron ore extracted, but encountered errors due to attempting to extract from an empty chest.\n  - Inventory variables: \n    - `wood`: Type: int, current value: 10\n    - `iron-ore`: Type: int, current value: 27\n    - `iron-plate`: Type: int, current value: 3579\n    - `iron-gear-wheel`: Type: int, current value: 4"}
