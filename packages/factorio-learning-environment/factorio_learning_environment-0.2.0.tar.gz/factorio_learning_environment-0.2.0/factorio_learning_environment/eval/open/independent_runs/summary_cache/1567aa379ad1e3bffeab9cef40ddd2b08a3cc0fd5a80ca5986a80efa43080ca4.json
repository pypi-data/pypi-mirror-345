{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (1 unit)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Moving or Placing Entities\n- **Cannot Move Stone Furnace**: Ensure that the destination location for moving a stone furnace is valid and unoccupied.\n- **Cannot Place Wooden Chest/Burner Inserter/Transport Belt**: Verify that the target tile for placing these entities is free and not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors When Extracting or Accessing Entities\n- **Could Not Get Prototype.StoneFurnace**: Ensure that the specified position for accessing a stone furnace actually contains the entity. Double-check the coordinates for accuracy.\n\n### Errors Related to Output Blockage\n- **Output Blocked by Item on the Ground**: Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the mining drill. Clear any items blocking the output manually if necessary.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly update and verify the positions of entities to ensure they match the intended design and layout.\n- Before attempting to place or move entities, confirm that the target location is suitable and not already occupied by another object."}
