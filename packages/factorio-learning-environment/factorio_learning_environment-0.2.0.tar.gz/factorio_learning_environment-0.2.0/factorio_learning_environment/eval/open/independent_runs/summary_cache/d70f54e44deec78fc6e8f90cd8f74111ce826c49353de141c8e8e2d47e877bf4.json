{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Factory at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (42, -83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (42.5, -80.5) and (43.5, -81.5)\n\n### Coal Storage at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient resources\n- Ensure that the wooden chest at (42.5, -81.5) is stocked with iron ore before attempting to extract from it. Regularly check and refill resources to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Errors when using burner mining drills without fuel\n- Always ensure that burner mining drills (e.g., at position (42.0, -83.0) and (-15.0, -50.0)) are fueled to maintain operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for items or space\n- Check the inventory of the destination for the burner inserters (e.g., at positions (42.5, -80.5) and (43.5, -81.5)). Ensure that there is sufficient space in the destination for items being inserted, and that source items are available.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked during the execution steps.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `wood`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n- `coal`: int"}
