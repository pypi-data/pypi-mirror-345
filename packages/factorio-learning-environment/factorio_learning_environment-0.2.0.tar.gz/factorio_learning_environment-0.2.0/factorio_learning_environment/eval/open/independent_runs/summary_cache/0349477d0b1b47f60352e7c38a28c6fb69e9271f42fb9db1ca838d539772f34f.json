{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple efforts to deploy a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) failed because no Lab items were available in the inventory and resource shortfalls prevented its proper crafting. Although operations referenced smelting performed in furnaces retrieved at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron production and at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production, these units were not constructed through agent placement and are not counted as new structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Misuse: The get_entities() function was called with unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. using \u201cradius\u201d) and with incorrect positional parameters. Follow the API\u2019s defined signature to avoid such TypeErrors.\n\u2022 Inventory Verification: Lab placement attempts failed because the required lab item was missing in the inventory. Always check for the necessary items before attempting structure placement.\n\u2022 NoneType Iteration: Filtering operations on get_entities() results caused errors when the returned value was None. Use a fallback (such as an empty list) to safely iterate over returned entities.\n\u2022 Resource and Recipe Dependencies: Lab crafting repeatedly failed due to shortages in essential sub-ingredients (iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables). Ensure that all intermediate resource chains and production lines are in place prior to initiating complex crafting operations."}
