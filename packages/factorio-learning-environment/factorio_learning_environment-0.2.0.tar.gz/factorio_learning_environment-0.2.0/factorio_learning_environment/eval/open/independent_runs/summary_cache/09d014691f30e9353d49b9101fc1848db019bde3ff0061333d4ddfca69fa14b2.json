{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with current status: EntityStatus.WORKING\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 8})\n  - Source: Inventory({'iron-ore': 2})\n  - Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 28})\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) with current status: EntityStatus.NORMAL\n  - Inventory: Inventory({'iron-plate': 100})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, the wooden chest could not be placed because it was not present in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required ingredients\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before crafting items. For instance, the wooden chest could not be crafted because the required ingredient (wood) was not available.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The wooden chest could not be placed at (3.0, 1.0) because the agent was too far away.\n\n### Errors related to technology requirements for crafting\n- Research the necessary technologies before attempting to craft items that require them. The steel chest could not be crafted because the Steel Processing technology was not unlocked.\n\n### Errors when not having enough resources for research\n- Ensure you have enough Automation Science Packs to conduct research. The agent did not have enough packs to research Steel Processing technology."}
