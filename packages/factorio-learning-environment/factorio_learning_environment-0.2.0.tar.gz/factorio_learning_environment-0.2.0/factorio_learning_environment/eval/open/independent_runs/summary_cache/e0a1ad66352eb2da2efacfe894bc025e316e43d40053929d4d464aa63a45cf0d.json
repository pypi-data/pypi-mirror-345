{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, ore inserters, plate inserters, and output chests have failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors in moving to positions\n- Correctly handle position data types when using movement functions. Errors such as \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" and \"'Position' object is not callable\" indicate issues with how position data is being accessed or used in movement functions.\n\n### Errors with building area setup\n- Adjust the size of the BuildingBox or use multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if no viable place is found for placing an entity. The error \"No viable place to put Prototype.WoodenChest near the centre position\" suggests the need for a more flexible approach in defining buildable areas."}
