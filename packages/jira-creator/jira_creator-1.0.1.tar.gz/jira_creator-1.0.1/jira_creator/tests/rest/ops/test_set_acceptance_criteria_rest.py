"""
This script defines a test function 'test_set_acceptance_criteria' that tests the functionality of setting acceptance
criteria for a JIRA issue using a provided client. The function simulates GET and PUT responses, calls the
'set_acceptance_criteria' method of the client, captures the output, and asserts that the output contains an expected
success message. The test function takes 'capsys' and 'client' as parameters and utilizes a mocked client request.

The 'test_set_acceptance_criteria' function sets acceptance criteria for a specified test issue identified by
'issue_key'.
It takes 'capsys' as a pytest fixture for capturing stdout and stderr output, and 'client' as an instance of the client
used to interact with the issue tracking system. The function has the side effect of setting the acceptance criteria for
the test issue.
