{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a status of no ingredients to smelt. Produces iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup with fluid system ID 9755, starting at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5) and extending through positions (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5). Status is empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 50515, including poles at positions (x=3.5, y=23.5), (x=-5.5, y=25.5), (x=0.5, y=24.5), ..., (x=1.5, y=18.5), (x=0.5, y=18.5), (x=-8.5, y=17.5). Voltage is currently 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when moving to a new area\n- Ensure that indices used for movement are integers and not strings to avoid type errors.\n\n### Errors when placing offshore pumps\n- Verify that the position is suitable for placing an offshore pump. Ensure proximity to water and clear space.\n\n### Errors when placing boilers and steam engines\n- Confirm that the chosen position is suitable and clear for placing boilers and steam engines.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the connection path between the offshore pump and the boiler is clear and that pipes are correctly aligned.\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles\n- Check that electric poles are placed correctly and within range to connect to each other."}
