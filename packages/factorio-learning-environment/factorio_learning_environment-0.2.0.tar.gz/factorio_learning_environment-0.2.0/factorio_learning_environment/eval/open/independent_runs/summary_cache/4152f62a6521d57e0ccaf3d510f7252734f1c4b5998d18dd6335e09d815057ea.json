{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Ore Extraction and Storage**\n  - Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Iron Ore Smelting**\n  - Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Fueling System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Coal Extraction**\n  - Coal is harvested from the nearest coal patch at position (40.5, -82.5).\n- **Fueling System**\n  - Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled by coal, extracting resources.\n\n### Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple wooden chests at various positions for storing iron plates and other resources:\n  - Positions: (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining and production stoppages. The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) cannot continue mining because the chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5) is full. Similarly, several chests storing iron plates are full, which could lead to production inefficiencies.\n\n### Efficient Resource Management\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of resources in chests and furnaces to ensure optimal use of space and resources.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count`: int - Tracks the number of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `coal_count`: int - Tracks the amount of coal harvested and used for fueling.\n- `iron_plate_count`: int - Tracks the number of iron plates produced and stored."}
