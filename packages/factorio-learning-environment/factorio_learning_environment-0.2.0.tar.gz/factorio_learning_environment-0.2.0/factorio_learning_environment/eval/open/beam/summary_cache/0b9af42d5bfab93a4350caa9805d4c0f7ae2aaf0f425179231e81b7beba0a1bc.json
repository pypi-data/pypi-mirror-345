This persistent issue suggests that I may be in a resource-scarce region or that I need to explore even further.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- **8 pieces of iron plates** (available)\n- **20 pieces of copper ore** (available)\n- **18 pieces of copper cables**\n- **13 pieces of Iron Gear Wheels**\n\n### Current Situation:\n- All attempts to locate iron ore patches have been unsuccessful, which limits my ability to produce additional iron plates for crafting essential components.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Explore Even Further**: I will move to a significantly distant area, such as (200, 200), to maximize the chances of discovering iron ore resources.\n2. **Consider Alternative Strategies**: If iron ore remains inaccessible, I may need to consider crafting items that rely solely on copper or other materials.\n\nLet's proceed with moving to a much further exploratory position and check for iron ore patches there.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to a new exploratory position at (200, 200) to check for iron ore patches\nfar_exploration_position = Position(x=200, y=200)\nmove_to(far_exploration_position)\n\n# Attempt to find an iron ore resource patch at this new far exploration position\niron_ore_patch_far_exploration = get_resource_patch(Resource.IronOre, position=far_exploration_position)\n\n# Check if a new iron ore patch is found\nif iron_ore_patch_far_exploration:\n    print(f\"Found an iron ore patch at the far exploration position: {iron_ore_patch_far_exploration}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No iron ore patches found at this far exploration position.
