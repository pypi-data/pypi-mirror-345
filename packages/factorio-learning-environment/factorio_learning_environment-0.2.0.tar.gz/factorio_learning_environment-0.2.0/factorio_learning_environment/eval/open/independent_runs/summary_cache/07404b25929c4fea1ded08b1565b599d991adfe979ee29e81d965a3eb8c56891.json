{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to pick up items from the source (chest) and drop them into the target (furnace). Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly set and that there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Always check your inventory for sufficient fuel before attempting to refuel entities. Ensure that you have enough coal or other fuel types available to keep your mining drills and inserters operational.\n\n### Errors Due to Empty Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are present in your inventory. This prevents errors related to trying to insert non-existent items."}
