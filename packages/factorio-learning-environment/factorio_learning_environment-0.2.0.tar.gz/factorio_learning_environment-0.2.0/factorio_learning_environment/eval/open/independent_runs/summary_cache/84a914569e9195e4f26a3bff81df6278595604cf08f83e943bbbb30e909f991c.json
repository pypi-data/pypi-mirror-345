{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with coal count: 7 and iron ore count: 12.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 50}.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 3.5)) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 50}.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 5.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 5.5)) with empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing an entity is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources\n- Gather the necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is required to craft a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft items without unlocking the recipe\n- Research the required technology before trying to craft items that depend on it. For instance, steel-processing technology must be researched to craft steel chests.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the target entity has enough capacity to accept the items being inserted. For example, check the inventory status of the wooden chest before inserting items."}
