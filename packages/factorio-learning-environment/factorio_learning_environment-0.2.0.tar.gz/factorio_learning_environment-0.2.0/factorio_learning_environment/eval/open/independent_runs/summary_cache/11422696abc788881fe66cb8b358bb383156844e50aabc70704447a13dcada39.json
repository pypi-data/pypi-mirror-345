{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of:\n- Small electric pole at position (13.5, 10.5) providing power to the lab.\n\n### Small Electric Poles\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (6.5, 0.5) connected to the nearest power source at (2.0, 0.0).\n- Small electric pole at position (13.5, 10.5) connected to the lab at (10.5, 10.5).\n- Small electric pole at position (16.5, 10.5) providing additional power.\n- Small electric pole at position (20.5, 10.5) providing additional power.\n\n### Furnaces\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) - Status: WORKING, Fuel: {'coal': 11}, Warnings: ['furnace result is full'].\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS, Fuel: {'coal': 8}, Warnings: ['no ingredients to smelt', 'furnace result is full'].\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 2.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS, Fuel: {'coal': 20}, Warnings: ['no ingredients to smelt', 'furnace result is full'].\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Inventory containing {'iron-plate': 200}.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before attempting to place a small electric pole. Check for nearby entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when searching for power sources\n- Ensure that there are available power sources (like steam engines or solar panels) within the vicinity before attempting to connect or place electric poles.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without inventory\n- Always check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to place any entities. If you run out of small electric poles, gather more before trying to place them.\n\n### Errors when connecting to power sources\n- Verify that the power source you are trying to connect to is within range and operational. If the lab status shows NO_POWER, check the connections and power availability."}
