{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. Misalignment will prevent the inserter from transferring items correctly.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position to ensure proper item transfer.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Maintain sufficient coal in inventory to refuel inserters and mining drills. Lack of fuel will halt operations.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Check that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. Misalignment or lack of input will result in the furnace not operating."}
