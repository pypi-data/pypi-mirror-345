{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Connected by a PipeGroup from Position (x=20.5, y=-10.5) to (x=20.5, y=-5.5)\n- Supported by Small Electric Poles at Positions (x=24.5, y=-6.5), (x=24.5, y=-7.5), and (x=22.5, y=-4.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) that puts into the Assembling Machine\n- Supported by Small Electric Pole at Position (x=10.5, y=-1.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) and a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and another at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=2.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Ensure that all necessary resources are available for production processes. For instance, the Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) is missing copper plates to create copper cables.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source container for inserters is stocked with items to prevent them from idling. The inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) is waiting for items due to an empty chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients to avoid warnings about no ingredients to smelt. The furnaces at Positions (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=2.0, y=0.0), and (x=5.0, y=5.0) are currently lacking ingredients."}
