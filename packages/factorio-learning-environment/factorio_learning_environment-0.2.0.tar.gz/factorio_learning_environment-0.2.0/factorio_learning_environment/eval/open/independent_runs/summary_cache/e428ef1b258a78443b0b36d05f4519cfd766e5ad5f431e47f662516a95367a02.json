{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Connected by PipeGroup:\n  - Water pipes from Offshore Pump to Boiler, starting at (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and ending at (x=-3.5, y=24.5)\n  - Steam pipes from Boiler to Steam Engine, starting at (x=-1.5, y=22.5) and ending at (x=5.5, y=24.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently without power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with Boiler Dimensions\n- Ensure the correct attribute names are used when accessing properties of prototypes. Double-check the API documentation for the correct attribute names.\n\n### Type Errors with Boiler Width and Height\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that the operands are of compatible types. Convert attributes to the correct type (e.g., float) before performing operations.\n\n### Connection Failures Due to Missing Items\n- Before attempting to connect entities (e.g., pipes, electric poles), verify that the required items are available in the inventory.\n\n### Crafting and Resource Availability\n- Regularly check inventory levels to ensure sufficient resources are available for crafting and fueling operations, such as small electric poles and coal for boilers.\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Ensure that all power-generating entities are properly connected to the power network with the necessary items, such as electric poles, to avoid warnings about being not connected to the power network."}
