{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 24.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid. The boiler is fully operational and connected to pipes for water and steam output.\n\n### Lab at position(5.5, -12.5)\nConsists of a lab (position 5.5, -12.5) that is currently not powered and is researching automation.\n\n### Stone furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently not smelting any ingredients.\n\n### Stone furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) that is currently not smelting any ingredients.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups positioned at:\n- PipeGroup (position -8.5, -6.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -7.5, -7.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -11.5, -4.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -9.5, -5.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -9.5, 21.5) which is currently full of steam.\n\n### Electricity group at position(0.5, -10.080645161290322)\nConsists of multiple small electric poles positioned around the electricity generator, including positions such as (0.5, -12.5) and (1.5, -12.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles to steam engine\n- Ensure that there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect electric poles to the steam engine. Check for nearby entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
