{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity generator at position(-1.5, 4.5)\nConsists of \n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-6.0, 1.5)\n- Steam engine at position(-1.5, 4.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\n- Small electric poles connecting steam engine to electric mining drill at position(15.5, -0.5)\n\n#### Coal mine at position(15.5, -0.5)\nConsists of \n- Electric mining drill at position(15.5, -0.5)\n- Wooden chest at position(15.5, 1.5) to collect coal\n\n#### Crude oil extraction and processing at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of \n- Pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5)\n- Storage tank at position(22.5, 42.5)\n- Pipe group connecting pumpjack to storage tank\n- Oil refinery at position(28.5, 45.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting steam engine to pumpjack and oil refinery\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when placing entities too far away from the player position\n  - Make sure to move to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n- Errors when electric mining drill is not receiving electricity\n  - Ensure that the electric mining drill is connected to a power source and that the power source is functioning.\n- Errors when boiler is out of fuel\n  - Ensure that the boiler is supplied with fuel (e.g., coal) to continue functioning.\n- Errors when attempting to place an entity at an occupied position\n  - Ensure that the target location is not occupied by another entity or part of the terrain is not unplaceable (e.g., water).\n- Errors when attempting to connect an empty storage tank to an oil refinery\n  - Ensure that the storage tank has the required fluid (e.g., crude oil) before attempting to connect it to an oil refinery.\n- Errors when inspecting the inventory of an entity\n  - Ensure that the entity has an inventory and that it is properly initialized before attempting to inspect it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
