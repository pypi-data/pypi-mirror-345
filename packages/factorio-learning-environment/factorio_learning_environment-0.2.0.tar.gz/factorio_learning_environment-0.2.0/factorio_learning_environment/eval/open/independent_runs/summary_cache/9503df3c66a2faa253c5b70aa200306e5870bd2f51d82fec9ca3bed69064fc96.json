Check the positions of electric poles and their connections.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target tile.\n\n### Errors related to fluid connections\n- Ensure that boilers and other fluid-consuming entities have the necessary connections to a fluid source (like water from an offshore pump) to function properly."}
