{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (10 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (35 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- **Burner Inserter, Wooden Chest, Stone Furnace, Transport Belt**: Ensure the target location is free of other entities or obstructions before attempting to place these items. Multiple attempts to place these items failed due to occupied or invalid locations.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- **Extracting from Drill's Drop Position**: Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- **Stone Furnace Retrieval**: Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. An attempt to retrieve a Stone Furnace at position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5) failed because no such entity was found.\n\n### Handling blocked outputs\n- **Burner Mining Drill Output Blockage**: Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the drill to prevent blockage and maintain continuous operation."}
