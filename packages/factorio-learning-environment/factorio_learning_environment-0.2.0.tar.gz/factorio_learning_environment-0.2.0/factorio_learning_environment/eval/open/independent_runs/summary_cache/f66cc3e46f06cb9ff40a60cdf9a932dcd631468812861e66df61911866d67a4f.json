{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transfer System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) transferring copper ore to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) via a Burner Inserter at position (-24.5, -69.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) transferring items from a Transport Belt to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates, connected via a Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5).\n\n### Belt Systems\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-21.5, -63.5) to (-21.5, -66.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-17.5, -62.5) to (-17.5, -64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-16.5, -64.5) to (-12.5, -58.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -62.5) to (-14.5, -65.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts\n- Ensure that there are no gaps in belt placement when connecting entities. Verify the continuity of belts between positions to avoid connection errors.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source entity.\n\n### Warnings for No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Verify that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Ensure that the input resources are available and correctly fed into the furnace."}
