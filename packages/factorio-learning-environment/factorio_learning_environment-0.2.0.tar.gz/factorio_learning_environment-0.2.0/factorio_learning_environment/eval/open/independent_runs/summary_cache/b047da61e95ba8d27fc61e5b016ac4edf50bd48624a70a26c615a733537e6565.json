{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report of the existing structures and error tips:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Processing System at (-28, -61) area\nConsists of two parallel mining setups:\n1. First Mining Line:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61)\n- Collection chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n- Input inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-25, -59)\n- Currently operational and producing copper plates\n\n2. Second Mining Line:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -63)\n- Currently blocked due to output issues\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing System at (-18, -49) area\nCurrently inactive setup consisting of:\n1. First Mining Line:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15, -50)\n- Burner inserter at (-13.5, -48.5)\n- Collection chest at (-12.5, -48.5) containing iron ore and plates\n\n2. Second Mining Line:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18, -49)\n- Burner inserter at (-16.5, -47.5)\n- Collection chest at (-15.5, -47.5) containing iron ore and plates\n\n### Additional Processing\nTwo stone furnaces at (0,0) and (2,0) for iron plate production, currently inactive\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a location\n- Common collision points observed at (-27.5, -61.5) where multiple placement attempts failed\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and consider entity dimensions\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices\n- Some mining drills are inactive due to lack of fuel\n- Cannot insert more fuel when inventory is full (observed with coal insertion attempt)\n\n### Entity Output Blocking\n- Ensure there is adequate space for entity outputs\n- Mining drills get blocked when their output position is occupied\n- Consider the complete production chain to prevent bottlenecks\n\n### Inserter Placement\n- When placing inserters, verify both pickup and drop positions are accessible\n- Consider entity dimensions when placing inserters next to furnaces\n- Use appropriate spacing when placing inserters between entities\n\n### System Design\n- Plan the layout considering the space requirements of all components\n- Ensure proper spacing between parallel production lines\n- Consider the complete material flow when designing processing chains"}
