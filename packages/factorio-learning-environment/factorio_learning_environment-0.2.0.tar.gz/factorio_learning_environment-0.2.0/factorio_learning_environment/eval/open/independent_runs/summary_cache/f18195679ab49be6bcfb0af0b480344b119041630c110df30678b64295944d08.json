{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(x=117.5, y=-30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position x=117.5 y=-30.5), boiler(position x=111.5 y=-32.0), offshore pump(position x=106.5 y=-32.5), and multiple pipes connecting them.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x=41.0 y=-82.0) and a furnace at position(x=41.0 y=-80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position x=39.5 y=-79.5) that puts items into the furnace\n-  Transport belt (position x=39.5 y=-83.5) that connects the mining drill to the furnace\n\n### Offshore pump system at position(x=116.5, y=-54.5)\nConsists of multiple offshore pumps (positions x=116.5 y=-54.5, x=115.5 y=-51.5, x=116.5 y=-53.5, x=116.5 y=-49.5, x=116.5 y=-47.5, x=116.5 y=-45.5, x=115.5 y=-43.5, x=115.5 y=-41.5, x=116.5 y=-40.5, x=118.5 y=-40.5, x=120.5 y=-40.5, x=122.5 y=-39.5, x=124.5 y=-39.5, x=126.5 y=-37.5, x=128.5 y=-35.5, x=130.5 y=-33.5) connected by pipes.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n*   **Incorrect use of connect_entities function**: The `connect_entities` function requires integer positions, but the agent is passing float values. To fix this, ensure that the positions are converted to integers before passing them to the function.\n*   **Incorrect access of entity attributes**: The agent is trying to access the `position` attribute of an integer object, which does not exist. To fix this, ensure that the correct entity object is being accessed.\n*   **Boiler out of fuel**: The boiler is out of fuel, which is causing it to not function. To fix this, ensure that the boiler is being fueled regularly.\n*   **No fluid present in offshore pump connections**: The offshore pumps are not connected to any fluid sources, which is causing them to not function. To fix this, ensure that the offshore pumps are connected to a fluid source.\n*   **No ingredients to smelt in furnace**: The furnace does not have any ingredients to smelt, which is causing it to not function. To fix this, ensure that the furnace is being provided with ingredients to smelt.\n*   **Output blocked by item on the ground**: The burner mining drill's output is being blocked by an item on the ground. To fix this, ensure that the item is removed or the mining drill is configured to handle this situation.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n*   **connect_entities function**: This function is used to connect entities, but it requires integer positions. It has been invoked multiple times, but has failed due to incorrect usage.\n*   **Entity attributes**: The agent has accessed entity attributes, but has made mistakes in doing so. It has tried to access the `position` attribute of an integer object, which does not exist.\n*   **Important variables**:\n    *   `offshore_pump`: The offshore pump entity.\n    *   `boiler`: The boiler entity.\n    *   `position`: The position of an entity.\n    *   `Prototype.Pipe`: The pipe prototype.\n    *   `connect_entities`: The function used to connect entities."}
