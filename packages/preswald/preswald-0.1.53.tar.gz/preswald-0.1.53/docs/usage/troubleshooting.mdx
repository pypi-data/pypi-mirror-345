## **Favicon or Logo Not Updating**

If your app's favicon or logo doesn't update in the browser, it might be due to browser caching. Use the following methods to perform a hard refresh:

- **macOS**:  
  Press `Command + Shift + R` to force a refresh.
- **Windows**:  
  Press `Ctrl + F5` to clear the cache and reload the page.

## **Docker Issues**

If you encounter issues related to Docker, verify that Docker is installed and running on your system.

### **Verify Docker Installation**

Run the following command in your terminal to check if Docker is installed:

```bash
docker --version
```

If Docker is not installed or the command fails, download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).

## **GCloud Deploy Not Working**

If deploying to Google Cloud Run fails, verify that the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud) is installed and configured correctly.

### **Verify GCloud CLI Installation**

Run the following command to confirm that the GCloud CLI is installed:

```bash
gcloud --version
```

If it is not installed, follow the [GCloud CLI Installation Guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

### **Common GCloud CLI Issues**

- **Authentication Error**: Run `gcloud auth login` to authenticate your account.
- **Project Configuration**: Select the correct project using `gcloud config set project <project-id>`.

## **Dependency Errors**

Dependency errors may arise if the required Python packages are not installed or if conflicting versions exist. Using a virtual environment can help isolate your dependencies.

### **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

#### **Using `venv`**

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

#### **Using Conda**

1. **Create a Conda Environment**:

   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.9
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the desired name for your environment and `3.9` with your desired Python version.

2. **Activate the Conda Environment**:

   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```

## **General Debugging Tips**

1. **Check Logs**:  
   Logs often provide detailed error messages. For example:
   - Docker logs: `docker logs <container-id>`
   - GCloud logs: `gcloud app logs read`
2. **Verify File Paths**:  
   Make sure all file paths referenced in your script (e.g., `data.csv`) are correct and accessible.

3. **Update Software**:

   - Verify your Python version matches the project's requirements.
   - Update Preswald with the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install --upgrade preswald
     ```

4. **Reinstall Dependencies**:  
   If dependency issues persist, delete the `env` folder, recreate the virtual environment, and reinstall dependencies.
