{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (27.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (27.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-11.0, 20.0) with a wooden chest at position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) for moving items between entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, 20.0) with a wooden chest at position (19.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Inserter at position (2.5, 1.5) for moving items between entities\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position (13.5, 0.5) for inputting copper plates\n- Belt Group connecting the stone furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) to the assembling machine at position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Operating Errors\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to move items from source to destination. Check for blockages or missing destination entities that might prevent inserters from functioning optimally.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that source items are available for inserters to pick up. If inserters are waiting for items, ensure that the upstream production or supply chain is functioning correctly.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Make sure there is a sink entity to accept the output from inserters. If the output is blocked, check for items on the ground or missing destination entities that might be causing the blockage."}
