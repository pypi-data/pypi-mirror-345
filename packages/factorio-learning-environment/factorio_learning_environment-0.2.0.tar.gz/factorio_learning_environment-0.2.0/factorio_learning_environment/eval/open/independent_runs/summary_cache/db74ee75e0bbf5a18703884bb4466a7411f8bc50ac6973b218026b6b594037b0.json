{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and outputs to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore, currently containing 710 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is refueled with coal and has a pickup position at (-12.5, -48.5) and a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collision with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure that the drop and pickup positions are correctly set to facilitate the transfer of resources.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of fuel (coal) for entities like burner mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Refuel entities promptly to avoid interruptions in resource processing.\n\n### Resource Transfer Errors\n- Check the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving iron ore. Ensure that the inserter is properly configured to transfer items from the chest to the furnace.\n\nBy addressing these errors and optimizing the setup, the efficiency of resource processing and production can be significantly improved."}
