{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Collection wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-28.5, -57.5) feeding from chest to furnace\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing processed plates\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in a row:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0)\nCollection system includes:\n- Collection chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters managing ore movement\n- Belt system connecting the components\n\n### Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nFour parallel smelting units consisting of:\n- Stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserters managing input and output for each furnace\n\n### Belt Transport System\nMultiple belt groups connecting various parts of the factory:\n- Main belt line from (-4.5, -57.5) to (0.5, -4.5)\n- Secondary belt lines at (-9.5, -54.5) and (-6.5, -54.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with belts\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests, use inserters instead\n- When creating belt connections, ensure proper entity compatibility\n\n### Entity placement and operation issues\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - ensure proper input material flow\n- Some inserters showing \"waiting for source items\" - verify input availability and proper positioning\n- Output blocked warnings on inserters - ensure proper output destination entity placement\n\n### Resource management\n- Several mining drills and inserters running low on fuel - maintain consistent coal supply\n- Monitor chest inventories to prevent overflow or resource starvation"}
