{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), refueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), refueled with coal, extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5), storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5), transferring coal and iron ore to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to insufficient items for insertion.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full storage. This will ensure continuous resource extraction.\n\n### Errors when smelting without ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt by regularly supplying them with raw materials. This will prevent the furnace from entering a 'no ingredients' state."}
