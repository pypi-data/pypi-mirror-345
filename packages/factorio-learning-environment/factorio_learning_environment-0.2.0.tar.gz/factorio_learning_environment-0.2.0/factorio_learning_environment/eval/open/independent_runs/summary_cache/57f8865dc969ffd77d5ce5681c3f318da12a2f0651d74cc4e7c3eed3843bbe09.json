{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0): Mines iron ore and drops it at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5): Stores iron ore mined by the drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5): Stores iron plates produced by the furnace.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has space for the item being inserted. If the furnace is full or the item type is incorrect, the insertion will fail.\n- Check the furnace's fuel and ingredient inventory before attempting to insert items.\n\n#### Errors with drill-to-chest item transfer\n- Verify that the drill's drop position aligns with the chest's position. Misalignment can prevent item transfer.\n- Ensure the chest is not full and has space to receive items from the drill.\n\n#### Errors with inserter operations\n- Confirm that the inserter has fuel and is correctly positioned to pick up and drop items between entities.\n- Ensure the inserter's source and target entities are operational and have items available for transfer.\n\n#### General placement errors\n- Always check for obstructions or overlapping entities before placing new structures or items.\n- Ensure entities are placed within valid tile boundaries and are compatible with adjacent structures."}
