{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) which is currently not receiving electricity and is supposed to manage the input/output of the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at position (6.5, -59.5) for storage purposes.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) which is out of fuel.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) which is not connected to the power network and lacks fluid input.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) providing water to the system.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs but no research in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Interaction\n- Ensure that when using `insert_item`, the second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Correct the argument to reference the correct entity.\n  \n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid errors like \"No coal to insert from your inventory\".\n\n### Power and Connectivity Issues\n- Ensure that all inserters and other electrical entities are connected to a power source to avoid \"not receiving electricity\" warnings.\n- Verify that all components of the electricity generation setup are properly connected and fueled to avoid issues like \"no input liquid\" or \"not connected to power network\"."}
