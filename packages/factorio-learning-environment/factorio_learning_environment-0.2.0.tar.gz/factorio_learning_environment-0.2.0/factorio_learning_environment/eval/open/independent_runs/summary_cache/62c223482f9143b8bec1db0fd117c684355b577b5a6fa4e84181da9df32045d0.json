{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Iron Chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5) and (-16.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for temporary storage\n\n### Coal Storage and Refueling Station at Position (44.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring coal to furnaces and other entities\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting operations\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Transferring Iron Ore\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to transfer to furnaces or chests. This will prevent errors related to \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when Placing into Non-Existent Entities\n- Verify the existence of target entities such as iron chests before attempting to transfer items. This will avoid errors like \"No entity of type iron-chest found at the specified position.\"\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Ensure that the supply chain is intact and that source items are available for inserters to function correctly. This will prevent inserters from waiting indefinitely for source items.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests."}
