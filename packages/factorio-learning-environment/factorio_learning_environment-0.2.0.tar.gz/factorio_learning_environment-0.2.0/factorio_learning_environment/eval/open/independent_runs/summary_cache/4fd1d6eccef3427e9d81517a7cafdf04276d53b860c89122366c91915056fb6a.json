{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\nThis facility is responsible for transferring iron ore from a chest to a furnace for smelting into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5) for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is aligned with the chest's position to facilitate the transfer of iron ore. Misalignment will prevent the inserter from picking up items correctly.\n\n### Inserter Drop Position Errors\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position to ensure that iron ore is correctly deposited into the furnace for smelting.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters and Drills\n- Regularly refuel inserters and mining drills with coal to maintain operational status. Lack of fuel will halt their operations.\n\n### Inventory Management for Fuel Insertion\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills. Attempting to refuel without coal will result in an error.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Supply\n- Check that the furnace is receiving iron ore from the inserter. If the furnace is not receiving ingredients, verify the inserter setup and alignment to ensure proper transfer of resources."}
