{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 16-23)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-5.0, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) (now with additional pump at (-9.5, -2.5))\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) (currently missing/unavailable)\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) (currently missing/unavailable)\n- Pipe network connecting offshore pumps (water)\n- Small electric poles at (0.5, 8.5) and (3.5, 9.5)\n\n### Chemical Plant Complex at position (6.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chemical plant (set to produce sulfur, currently without power)\n- Storage tank at (3.5, 12.5)\n- Partial water pipe connection from offshore pump\n- Missing petroleum gas input\n- Missing power connection\n\n### Water Pipe Network\nConsists of:\n- Two offshore pumps at (-9.5, -0.5) and (-9.5, -2.5)\n- Extensive pipe network connecting to chemical plant\n- Multiple pipe groups with varying statuses (WORKING, FULL_OUTPUT, EMPTY)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement distance issues\n- Move closer to target position before attempting to place entities (max distance is 10 tiles)\n- Verify player position relative to target placement location\n- Consider moving in stages when building distant structures\n\n### Missing entity errors\n- Verify entities exist before attempting to interact with them\n- Check for entity destruction or removal before making assertions\n- Implement existence checks before get_entity calls\n\n### Power system failures\n- Steam engine assertion failed due to lack of power production\n- Verify all power generation components are properly connected\n- Check fuel supply to boilers and water supply to steam engines\n\n### Inventory management issues\n- Check inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Track entity counts in inventory to prevent placement attempts without items\n- Implement inventory checks before placement operations\n\n### Chemical plant operational issues\n- Power connection still missing despite attempts\n- Petroleum gas input not connected\n- Verify all recipe requirements are met before expecting production\n\n### Placement collision issues\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Consider alternative directions or spacing when placement fails\n- Verify terrain is suitable for placement (avoid water tiles)\n\n### Pipe network problems\n- Some pipe groups showing EMPTY status despite connections\n- Verify fluid types match throughout the network\n- Check for breaks or missing connections in pipe chains"}
