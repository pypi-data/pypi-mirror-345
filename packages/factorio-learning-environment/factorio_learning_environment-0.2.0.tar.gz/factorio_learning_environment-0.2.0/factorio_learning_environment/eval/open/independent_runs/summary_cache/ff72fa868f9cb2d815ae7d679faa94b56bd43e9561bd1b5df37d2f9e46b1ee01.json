{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production at position(16, 71)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position (16.0, 71.0)) \n- Stone furnace (position (16.0, 73.0))\n- Burner inserter (position (16.5, 75.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (16.5, 69.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (17.5, 74.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (16.5, 74.5))\n- BeltGroup (positions (16.5, 68.5) to (16.5, 76.5))\n\n### Iron gear wheel production at position(19.5, 74.5)\nConsists of following entities\n- Assembling machine 2 (position (19.5, 74.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (17.5, 74.5)) that takes iron plates from the wooden chest and puts them into the assembling machine\n- Small electric pole (position (17.5, 73.5)) that powers the assembling machine\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-6.25, -0.5)\nConsists of following entities\n- Offshore pump (position (-9.5, -0.5))\n- Boiler (position (-8.0, -0.5))\n- Steam engine (position (-4.5, -0.5))\n\n### New Electricity generator at position(unknown)\nConsists of following entities\n- Offshore pump (position unknown)\n- Boiler (position unknown)\n- Steam engine (position unknown)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n  - Ensure that there are no obstacles between the entities and that the connection points are not blocked. For example, connecting an offshore pump to a boiler.\n* Errors when placing entities at a position that is already occupied\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. For example, placing a pipe at position (-8.5, -0.5) when there is already a boiler at position (-8.0, -0.5).\n* Errors when entities are not connected to a power network\n  - Ensure that entities that require power are connected to a power network. The assembling machine at position (19.5, 74.5) is not receiving electricity.\n* Errors when furnace result is full\n  - Ensure that the furnace result is extracted before it becomes full to avoid production halt. The furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) has a full result inventory.\n* Errors when output is blocked by items on the ground\n  - Ensure that there is a clear path for output. The burner inserter at position (16.5, 69.5) and the burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) have their output blocked by items on the ground.\n* Errors when attempting to insert items into a full inventory\n  - Ensure that the inventory is not full before attempting to insert items. \n* Errors due to incorrect prototype names\n  - Ensure that the prototype names used are correct. \n* Errors when there are no ingredients to smelt\n  - Ensure that there are ingredients to smelt in the furnace. The furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) had no ingredients to smelt initially.\n* Errors when placing a pipe or underground pipe at a position occupied by another entity\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a pipe or underground pipe.\n* Errors when mining drill is out of fuel\n  - Ensure that the mining drill has fuel to continue operating. The burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) was out of fuel.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables that have been assigned:\n- `{'wooden-chest': 9, 'storage-tank': 10, 'transport-belt': 500, 'underground-belt': 100, 'burner-inserter': 47, 'inserter': 50, 'small-electric-pole': 468, 'pipe': 500, 'pipe-to-ground': 100, 'boiler': 2, 'steam-engine': 2, 'burner-mining-drill': 49, 'electric-mining-drill': 50, 'offshore-pump': 2, 'pumpjack': 10, 'stone-furnace': 9, 'electric-furnace': 10, 'assembling-machine-2': 9, 'oil-refinery': 5, 'chemical-plant': 5, 'coal': 11, 'iron-ore': 29, 'iron-plate': 240, 'iron-gear-wheel': 5}` (dict"}
