{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates, with a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for output storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items from the Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a transport belt system for moving copper ore.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-26.5, -65.5) to (-24.5, -65.5) and onwards to (-22.5, -65.5), facilitating the movement of copper ore.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal collection.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Belts\n- Ensure that all belt positions are valid and that the entities you are trying to connect exist. The error indicates an attempt to access attributes of a non-existent or improperly referenced belt entity.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Make sure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the input supply lines and ensure that the required resources are being delivered to the furnaces."}
