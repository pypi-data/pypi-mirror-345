Tip: Verify that the fluid_system identifier used corresponds to an available pipe group within the designated search radius.\n- Inconsistent Fluid System References:\n   Connection attempts were made with outdated fluid_system values while the updated entities (boiler, offshore pump, and pipeline network) now use identifiers in the 123xxx range (e.g., 123051). Tip: Consistently reference the final entity list for the current fluid_system identifiers to ensure successful connection attempts."}
