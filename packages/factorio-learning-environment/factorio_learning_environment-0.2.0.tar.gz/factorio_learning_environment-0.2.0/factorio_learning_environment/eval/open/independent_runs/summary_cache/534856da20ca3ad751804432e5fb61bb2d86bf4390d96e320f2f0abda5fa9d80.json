{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Processing Unit at position(61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at (61.0, -54.0) acting as the central smelting facility (now fueled with {'coal': 9}).\n- Wooden Chest functioning as output storage, now relocated to (63.5, -56.5).\n- Furnace Output Inserters:\n  - Primary at (63.5, -53.5).\n  - Secondary at (61.5, -55.5) with a pickup position at (61.5, -54.5) and a drop position at (61.5, -56.5).\n- Chest Input Inserters:\n  - One remains at (62.5, -52.5).\n  - One repositioned and placed at (62.5, -49.5) (spacing increased with DOWN direction).\n  - An additional unit at (63.5, -55.5) rotated to deposit items into the chest (with pickup at (63.5, -54.5)).\n- Transport Belt connections:\n  - Initially attempted between furnace output inserter drop and chest input inserter pickup (from (61.5, -56.5) to (63.5, -54.5)); connection finally succeeded after crafting and inventory adjustments.\n- BurnerInserters associated with the processing unit and adjacent entities:\n  - BurnerInserter at (61.5, -55.5) containing fuel {'coal': 2}.\n  - BurnerInserter at (63.5, -55.5) containing fuel {'coal': 2} (previously reported with an 'out of fuel' warning, later refueled).\n  - BurnerInserter at (62.5, -52.5) containing fuel {'coal': 1}.\n  - BurnerInserter at (62.5, -50.5) containing fuel {'coal': 1}.\n  - BurnerInserter at (62.5, -49.5) containing fuel {'coal': 1}.\n  - BurnerInserter at (63.5, -53.5) containing fuel {'coal': 4}.\n- Belt Groups remain in place connecting various inserters and machines as per design.\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Transport belt connection errors due to insufficient inventory:\n  \u2022 Before connecting, verify that the required transport belt items are available to avoid repeated connection failures.\n- Incorrectly repositioned chest input inserters or inserting into occupied positions:\n  \u2022 Ensure a clear target location by checking spacing and alignment relative to adjacent storage entities.\n- Crafting failures when essential sub-ingredients are missing:\n  \u2022 Confirm that all sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-plate for transport belts) can be crafted or are present before initiating a craft.\n- Refueling errors arising from insufficient coal:\n  \u2022 Always verify current inventory levels for coal before attempting refuel operations to prevent assertion errors.\n- Insertion failures into burner inserters when inventory lacks fuel:\n  \u2022 Double-check inventory for adequate fuel quantities prior to refuel actions on burner inserters to mitigate failed insertions.\n\n"}
