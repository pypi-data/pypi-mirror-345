{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map during these steps. Multiple attempts were made to create and supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded because of inventory shortages and placement errors. Although existing smelting furnaces were used (the furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron plate production and the furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production), they were not newly built by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval:\n  - Use the correct function signature for get_entities. Avoid unexpected keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) or supplying positional arguments when none are expected.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting:\n  - Verify that the required Lab item is present in inventory before attempting placement.\n  - When filtering retrieved entities, ensure that a None value is properly handled (e.g., by initializing an empty list) to avoid iteration errors.\n  - Confirm that all sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) and their production prerequisites are available prior to initiating Lab crafting.\n\n\u2022 Resource and Dependency Management:\n  - Coordinate preceding production steps (such as smelting) to produce sufficient intermediate resources before commencing complex crafting tasks.\n  - Check all resource requirements for cascading recipes to ensure that crafting operations can complete successfully."}
