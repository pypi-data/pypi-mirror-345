{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (x=3.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=-0.5) and (x=3.5, y=-0.5) for inserting materials into the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=8.0, y=10.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Belt system at position (x=3.5, y=1.5) for transporting iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=6.5, y=1.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Belt Systems\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various positions, including:\n  - BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-3.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-5.5, y=-53.5) and outputs from (x=-0.5, y=-1.5) to (x=0.5, y=-0.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-49.5) and outputs from (x=2.5, y=-2.5) to (x=1.5, y=-1.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) and outputs from (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) and outputs from (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs from (x=4.5, y=1.5) to (x=2.5, y=1.5) and outputs from (x=5.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Avoid using sleep functions that may cause TimeoutError. Consider using event-driven approaches or checking conditions in a loop with a timeout.\n\n### Insertion Errors Due to Lack of Inventory\n- Ensure that there are sufficient items in the inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity, such as a belt or chest.\n\n### Repositioning Inserters\n- Correctly position inserters to ensure they can pick up and drop items effectively. Reposition if necessary to align with the intended source and destination.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly check fuel levels in inserters and furnaces to prevent interruptions in production due to lack of fuel."}
