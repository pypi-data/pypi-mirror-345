Check if the source entities are producing items and that there is a clear path for the inserters to pick up items.\n\n### Burners Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner mining drills and burner inserters. Make sure they are refueled to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Chest Full\n- Regularly empty chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage. Ensure that there is a continuous flow of items from chests to processing units.\n\n### Furnaces with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a steady supply of ingredients to process. Check the supply lines and inserters feeding into the furnaces to maintain continuous production."}
