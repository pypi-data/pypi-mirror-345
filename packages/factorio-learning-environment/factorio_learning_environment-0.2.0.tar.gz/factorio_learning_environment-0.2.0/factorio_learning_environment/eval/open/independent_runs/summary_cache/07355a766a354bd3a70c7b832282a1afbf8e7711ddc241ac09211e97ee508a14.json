{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-23.0, y=-66.0).\n- Transport Belt group connecting the Burner Mining Drill to the Stone Furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to the Wooden Chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using transport belts\n- Ensure that all entities involved in transport belt connections are properly initialized and not `NoneType`. This will prevent errors such as \"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'\".\n  \n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Make sure there is a sink entity available to accept outputs from mining drills to avoid warnings like \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n\n### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt\"."}
