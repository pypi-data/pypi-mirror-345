{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the boiler and steam engine, and from the offshore pump to the boiler\n- Electricity poles forming an electricity group with positions including (x=24.5, y=22.5), (x=16.5, y=24.5), (x=33.5, y=24.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that all necessary fluid connections are established and that the steam engine is connected to a working fluid system. Check for any missing pipes or incorrect connections.\n\n### Errors Due to Boiler Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel boilers with the appropriate fuel to maintain operation. Check fuel levels frequently to avoid interruptions in power generation.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Verify that all fluid systems are properly connected and that there are no leaks or blockages. Ensure that offshore pumps are supplying water effectively to the connected systems.\n\n### Errors with Entity Status\n- Monitor the status of entities such as boilers and steam engines to ensure they are functioning correctly. Address any warnings or errors promptly to maintain efficiency."}
