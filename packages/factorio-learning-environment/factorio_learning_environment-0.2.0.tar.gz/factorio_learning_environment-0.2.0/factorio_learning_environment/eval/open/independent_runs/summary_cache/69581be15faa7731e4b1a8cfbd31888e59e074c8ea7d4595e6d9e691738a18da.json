Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Check if an entity already exists at the target position before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Verify that an entity of the specified type exists at the given position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a small electric pole.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in unplaceable terrain\n- Check if the target position is on a valid terrain type (e.g., not on water) before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure that the connection points of the source and target entities are not blocked and are able to receive the fluid from the source.\n\n### Errors when placing boilers or pipes near water or other entities\n- Ensure that the target position is not too close to water or other entities that may interfere with the placement.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes to boilers or other entities\n- Ensure that the pipe is properly connected to the entity's connection points.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them.\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent attributes of an object\n- Verify that the attribute exists for the given object before attempting to access it.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place an entity at a position occupied by another entity\n- Remove the existing entity or choose a different position.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drill`: BurnerMiningDrill, position of the drill\n- `furnace_pos`: Position, intended position of the furnace\n- `inserter_pos`: Position, intended position of the inserter\n- `boiler_pos`: Position, intended position of the boiler\n- `pole_pos`: Position, intended position of the pole\n- `copper_ore_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill, copper ore drill entity\n- `iron_ore_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill, iron ore drill entity\n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs."}
