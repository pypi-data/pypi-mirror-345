{"content": "\"\"\"\nIt appears that there are no assembling machines available in the environment, and I encountered an error when attempting to craft an Assembling Machine 1. The error indicates that I cannot craft the assembling machine because it requires iron plates, which I cannot produce without an assembling machine.\n\n### Problem Summary:\n- **No assembling machines** are available in the environment.\n- **Failed to craft an Assembling Machine 1** due to the lack of an appropriate crafting setup.\n\n### Current Inventory:\n- **Coal**: 5 units\n- **Stone**: 10 units\n- **Iron Plates**: 12 units\n- **Copper Cables**: 18 units\n- **Iron Gear Wheels**: 2 units\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Gather more iron ore** to produce additional iron plates using the furnace.\n2. **Continue smelting iron ore** until I can produce enough iron plates to craft an assembling machine.\n3. **Once I have enough iron plates**, I can craft the assembling machine and then proceed to craft the iron gear wheels.\n\nLet's proceed to gather more iron ore from nearby deposits and smelt them in the furnace.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Gather more iron ore from nearby deposits\niron_ore_deposits = get_entities(Prototype.IronOre)\n\n# Check if there are any iron ore deposits available\nif iron_ore_deposits:\n    print(f\"Found {len(iron_ore_deposits)} iron ore deposits nearby.
