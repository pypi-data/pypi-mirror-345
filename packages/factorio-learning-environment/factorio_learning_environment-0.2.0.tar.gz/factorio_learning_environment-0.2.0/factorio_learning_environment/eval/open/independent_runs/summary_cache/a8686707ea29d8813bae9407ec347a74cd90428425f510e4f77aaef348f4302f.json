{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for collecting iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (4.5, 0.5) intended to transfer items but currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, attempting to place a burner inserter failed due to lack of inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required ingredients\n- Verify you have all required ingredients before crafting. Crafting transport belts failed due to missing iron plates.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities improperly\n- Use appropriate entities to connect items. Belts cannot be connected directly from a wooden chest; use an inserter to transfer items from the chest to the belt.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Check that the target position is free before placing an entity. Attempting to place a burner inserter failed because the position was already occupied.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory\n- Ensure you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. Attempting to insert coal failed due to lack of coal in inventory."}
