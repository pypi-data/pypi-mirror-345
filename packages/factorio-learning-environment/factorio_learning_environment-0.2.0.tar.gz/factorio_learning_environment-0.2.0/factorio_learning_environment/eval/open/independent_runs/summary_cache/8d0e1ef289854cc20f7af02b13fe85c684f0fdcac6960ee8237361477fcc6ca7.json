{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Expanded from the lab at position (5.5, 5.5) to the power source at position (10.5, 34.5).\n- Consists of multiple small electric poles connecting various points including positions (7.5, 17.5), (9.5, 23.5), (13.5, 27.5), (16.5, 31.5), and (12.5, 34.5).\n\n### Steam Power Generation at Position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Consists of:\n  - Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n  - Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n  - Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n  - Pipe Groups connecting the steam engine and boiler with the offshore pump.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -82.5) connected to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -82.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n- Belt Group transporting coal with belts at positions (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5), and (49.5, -86.5) to (47.5, -86.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Processing\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) with a pickup position at (53.5, -83.5) and a drop position at (55.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Processing\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage\n- Iron Chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure all pipe groups are properly connected to form a continuous path for fluid transport. Check the connections if a pipe group is not found.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Connections\n- Verify that all components requiring electricity are connected to a power source. If no electricity group is found, check the connections between electric poles and the power source.\n\n### Warnings from Burner Mining Drill\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill to prevent it from stopping due to a full chest.\n\n### Warnings from Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid it being idle with a \"no ingredients to smelt\" status."}
