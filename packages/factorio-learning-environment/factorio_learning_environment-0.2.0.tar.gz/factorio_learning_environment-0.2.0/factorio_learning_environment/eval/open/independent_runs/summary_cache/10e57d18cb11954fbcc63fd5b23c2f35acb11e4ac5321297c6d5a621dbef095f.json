Check for obstructions or unsuitable terrain that might prevent placement.\n\n### Errors in Boiler Placement\n- **Issue**: Boiler placement attempts were unsuccessful due to unsuitable positions.\n- **Tip**: Verify that the intended placement area for the boiler is clear of obstructions and is on a valid terrain type. Consider adjusting the position relative to the water source to ensure proper connection with the offshore pump."}
