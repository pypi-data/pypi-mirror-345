{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Boiler at position(-11.5, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -11.5, 25.0) with a full output status and connected to an offshore pump.\n- Pipe connections to various positions that facilitate fluid movement.\n\n### Steam Engine at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine (position -11.5, 18.5) currently not connected to a power network, with warnings about no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- Pipe connections to various positions that facilitate fluid movement.\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump (position -9.5, 24.5) that is operational and connected to the boiler.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple pipes connecting the boiler and steam engine, facilitating fluid transfer between them.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at various positions providing electricity to nearby structures.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0).\n\n### Copper Plate Factory at position(5, 5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0).\n\n### Lab at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 0.0, 0.0) currently without power.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that the positions of the boiler and steam engine are correctly aligned for pipe connections. Check for any obstacles or incorrect placements that might prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with empty fluid systems\n- Verify that the fluid systems are filled with the necessary fluids before attempting to connect or use them. Check the status of pipes and connections to ensure they are operational."}
