{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (17.5, 20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', status: NOT_CONNECTED.\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 23.0) with warning 'out of fuel', status: NO_FUEL.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), status: WORKING.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Pipe Group at position (3.5, 17.5) with fluid system 14219, status: EMPTY.\n- Pipe Group at position (-9.5, 23.5) with fluid system 14230, fluid: water, status: FULL_OUTPUT.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with ID 26621, consisting of poles at various positions, including (1.5, 14.5), (-2.5, 17.5), (10.5, 17.5), etc., voltage: 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Resources\n- Ensure that you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into the boiler failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Entity Connections\n- Verify that all necessary connections are established for entities to function correctly. The steam engine is not connected to any fluid source, leading to warnings and non-functionality.\n\n### Errors Due to Fuel Shortage\n- Maintain adequate fuel supplies for entities that require them, such as boilers, to avoid interruptions in operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before invoking this function to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler`: Represents the boiler entity. Ensure it has adequate fuel for operation.\n- `pipe`: Represents pipe entities used in fluid transport systems.\n- `offshore_pump`: Represents the offshore pump entity, crucial for water supply in the fluid system."}
