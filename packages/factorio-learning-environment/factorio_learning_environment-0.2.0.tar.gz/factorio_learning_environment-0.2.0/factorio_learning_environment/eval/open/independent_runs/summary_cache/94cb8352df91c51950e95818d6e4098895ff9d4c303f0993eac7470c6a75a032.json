For example, 'PipeGroup' object has no attribute 'warnings'. \n### Errors when using unary operators\n- Be cautious when using unary operators on objects. For example, bad operand type for unary -: 'BurnerMiningDrill'. Ensure the object supports the operation.\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target location is clear of obstacles and is placeable terrain. For example, Could not place electric-furnace at (15.0"}
