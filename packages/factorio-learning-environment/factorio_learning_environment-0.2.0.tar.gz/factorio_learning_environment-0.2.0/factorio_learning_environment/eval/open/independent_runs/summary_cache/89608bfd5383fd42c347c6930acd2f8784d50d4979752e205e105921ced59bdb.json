{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Stone furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, currently inactive due to no ingredients.\n- Stone furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Multiple wooden chests positioned at (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5) for storage.\n- Burner inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), (20.5, 0.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located at an unspecified position, currently inactive due to no power.\n\n### Fluid Transport System\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- Various pipe groups positioned across the map, including positions like (17.5, 3.5), (-0.5, 11.5), (5.5, 18.5), and others, all currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity group with poles positioned at various locations, such as (1.5, 10.5), (10.5, 13.5), and others, currently with no voltage.\n\n### Offshore Pump System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-11.5, 26.5), currently not connected to any fluid system.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Setup\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 26.0), currently not connected and out of fuel.\n- Offshore pump at position (-11.5, 26.5), intended to connect to the boiler but currently failing to connect.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Usage of `pickup_entity` Function\n- Ensure that when using `pickup_entity`, only the entity is passed without specifying a position. The function does not accept a second argument as a Position object.\n\n### Attribute Error with `ElectricityGroup`\n- Verify that the correct attributes are being accessed for objects. The `ElectricityGroup` object does not have a `prototype` attribute. Ensure the correct usage of object attributes.\n\n### Connection Failures with Pipes\n- When connecting pipes, ensure that the correct types (`Pipe`, `UndergroundPipe`) are used and that the positions are correctly specified. Check that the entities being connected are at the expected positions and are compatible.\n\n### Obstructions and Entity Placement\n- Clear any obstructions before attempting to place entities. Ensure that the target position is free of other entities or obstacles to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Ensure that boilers and steam engines are correctly aligned and connected with appropriate pipes. Verify that the positions are accurate and that there are no gaps in the connection.\n\n### Assertion and Attribute Errors with Inventory\n- Ensure that inventory checks are correctly implemented. Verify that the correct attribute names are used, such as `PipeGroup` instead of `PipeToGround`, to avoid attribute errors.\n\n### Persistent Connection Issues with Offshore Pump\n- When connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and that there are no gaps or incorrect pipe types being used. Verify the positions and compatibility of connecting entities."}
