It may require additional fuel or a reset of the crafting process.\n2. **Insert More Fuel if Necessary**: If the furnace is running low on fuel, I may need to insert more coal to continue the smelting process.\n3. **Wait for Further Processing**: If the furnace is still operational, I should allow it more time to complete the smelting of the remaining iron ore.\n\nLet\u2019s check the furnace's fuel status and insert more coal if necessary.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the furnace's fuel status\nfurnace_fuel_status = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace fuel status: {furnace_fuel_status}\")  # Check how much fuel is available\n\n# If fuel is low, insert more coal into the furnace\nif furnace_fuel_status['fuel']['coal'] < 2:  # Check if coal is less than 2\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 pieces of coal\n\n# Check the status of the furnace after potentially inserting more coal\nfurnace_inventory_after_fuel_insertion = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory after checking fuel: {furnace_inventory_after_fuel_insertion}\")  # Check furnace contents again\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after all actions: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states.", "summary_range": "[1-220]"}
