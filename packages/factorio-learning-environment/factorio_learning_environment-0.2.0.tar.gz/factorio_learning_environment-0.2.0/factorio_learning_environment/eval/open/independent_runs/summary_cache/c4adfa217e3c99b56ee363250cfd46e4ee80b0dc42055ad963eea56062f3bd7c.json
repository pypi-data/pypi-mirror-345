{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Pipe connections from the offshore pump to the boiler and attempts to connect to the steam engine. However, the connection to the steam engine is incomplete due to placement issues.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and another wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5).\n- Multiple iron chests at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) for coal and iron plate storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5) storing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Transportation and Belt Systems\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs for coal transportation, including belts at positions (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5) and (x=49.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5).\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently without power.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity poles forming a network with poles at positions (x=7.5, y=9.5), (x=7.5, y=17.5), (x=9.5, y=23.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Steam Engine\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly placed and connected without any obstructions. Check for existing objects in the way before attempting to place pipes.\n- Verify that the player is within the maximum allowable distance from the target position when placing pipes or other entities.\n\n### Errors in Managing Inventory\n- Regularly check and manage inventory space to prevent overflow. Ensure that chests have enough capacity before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement."}
