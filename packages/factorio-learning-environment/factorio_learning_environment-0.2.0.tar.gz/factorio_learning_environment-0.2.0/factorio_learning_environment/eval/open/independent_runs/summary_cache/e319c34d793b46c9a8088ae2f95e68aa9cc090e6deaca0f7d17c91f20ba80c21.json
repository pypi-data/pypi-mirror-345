{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity group at position (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity group blocking connection point at (52.5, 49.0)\n- Electricity group blocking connection point at (52.5, 54.0)\n\n### Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) connected to a pipe (position -9.5, 23.5) and another pipe (position -9.5, 22.5)\n\n### Pipe group\nConsists of a series of pipes forming a fluid system, with the fluid system working to transport water.\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with an inventory of coal and producing copper plates.\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position 6.5, 1.5) which is currently not powered and conducting automation research.\n\n### Burner inserter at position (8.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) which is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Chests\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 1.5) containing iron plates.\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 3.5) containing iron plates.\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 5.5) currently empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that cannot be built upon (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors when trying to access entities\n- Verify the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting to access them. For example, ensure that a steam engine is present at the intended coordinates before calling it.\n\n### Repeated errors with electric poles\n- The same errors regarding the inability to place electric poles at (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0) have occurred multiple times; ensure to clear the area of any obstructions before attempting to place new poles.\n\n### Errors with entity retrieval\n- The error regarding the inability to retrieve the steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0) suggests that the entity may not exist at that location. Always confirm the presence of the entity before attempting to retrieve it."}
