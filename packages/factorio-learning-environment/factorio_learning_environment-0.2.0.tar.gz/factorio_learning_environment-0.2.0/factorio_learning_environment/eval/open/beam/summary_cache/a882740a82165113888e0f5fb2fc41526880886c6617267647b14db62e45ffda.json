{"content": "The error indicates that the target position for placing the boiler is too far from the player's current position. To resolve this, you need to move closer to the desired placement location before attempting to place the boiler. Here's how you can adjust the steps:\n\n### Steps to Place the Boiler and Steam Engine:\n\n1. **Move Closer to the Desired Position:**\n   - First, move the player closer to the offshore pump and the intended position for the boiler.\n\n2. **Place the Boiler:**\n   - Once you are within range, place the boiler adjacent to the offshore pump to ensure it receives water.\n\n3. **Place the Steam Engine:**\n   - Place the steam engine adjacent to the boiler to receive steam.\n\n4. **Fuel the Boiler:**\n   - Insert coal into the boiler to start generating steam.\n\n5. **Connect the Power Network:**\n   - Use small electric poles to connect the steam engine to the assembling machine.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Move closer to the offshore pump and intended boiler position\noffshore_pump_position = Position(x=-13.5, y=-1.5)\nmove_to(Position(x=-12.0, y=-1.5))  # Move within range of the offshore pump\n\n# Step 2: Place the boiler next to the offshore pump\nboiler_position = Position(x=-12.5, y=-1.5)  # Adjust to ensure proper connection\ntry:\n    boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\n    assert boiler, \"Failed to place the Boiler.\"\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error placing Boiler: {e}\")\n\n# Step 3: Place the steam engine next to the boiler\nsteam_engine_position = Position(x=-11.5, y=-1.5)  # Ensure connection to the boiler\ntry:\n    steam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=steam_engine_position)\n    assert steam_engine, \"Failed to place the Steam Engine.\"\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error placing Steam Engine: {e}\")\n\n# Step 4: Fuel the boiler\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=10)\n\n# Step 5: Connect the power network to the assembling machine\n# Move to the assembling machine and connect using small electric poles\nmove_to(Position(x=4.5, y=0.5))  # Position of the assembling machine\npole_positions = [pole.position for pole in get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})]\n\n# Extend the network to the machine\nfor pole_position in pole_positions:\n    connect_entities(steam_engine, pole_position, Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\n\n# Verify the assembling machine's power status\nassembling_machine = get_entity(Prototype.AssemblingMachine1, Position(x=4.5, y=0.5))\nprint(f\"Assembling machine status after power connection: {assembling_machine.status}, Warnings: {assembling_machine.warnings}\")\n\n# Final status check\nprint(f\"Updated Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Key Tips:\n- Always ensure you are within the maximum placement range for entities.\n- Verify connectivity by checking the status of entities after placement.\n- Use small electric poles to extend the power network efficiently.", "summary_range": "[1-146]"}
