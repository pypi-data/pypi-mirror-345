{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Multiple stone furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, -60.5) and (4.5, -58.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), and (-7.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining and production stoppages. For example, the chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5) is full, causing the mining drill to stop working.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to smelt. The furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) have warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the final inventory of the agent, including items like wood, coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels."}
