{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel'.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) functioning with water supply.\n- Pipe Network connecting these entities with various pipe positions, ensuring fluid flow between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n- Electricity Network with poles at various positions, though currently showing zero voltage.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Connectivity\n- Ensure that all fluid connections, especially to the steam engine, are properly established to avoid 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections' warnings.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to prevent 'out of fuel' status, which halts energy production.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Network\n- Verify the connectivity and functionality of the electricity poles to ensure they are transmitting power, as the current voltage is zero.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- **Important Variables**: None explicitly assigned or mentioned in the provided logs."}
