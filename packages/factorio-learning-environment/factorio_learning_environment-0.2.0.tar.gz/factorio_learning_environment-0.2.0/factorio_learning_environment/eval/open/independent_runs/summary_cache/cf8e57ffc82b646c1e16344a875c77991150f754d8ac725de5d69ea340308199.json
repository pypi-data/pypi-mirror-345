{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) storing coal\n\n### Copper and Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) extracting copper and iron ore\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the mining drill to other entities:\n  - Belt from (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-24.5, y=-65.5)\n  - Belt from (x=-24.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-65.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) producing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transferring items to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-21.5, y=-65.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) producing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing transport belts\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and free of obstructions before placing a transport belt. Attempting to place a belt at an occupied position will result in failure.\n\n### Errors with inserter output\n- Ensure there is a valid destination for the inserter's output. If the output is blocked or there is no sink entity, the inserter will not function properly.\n\n### Errors with furnace operation\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. If the furnace is missing ingredients, it will not produce any output."}
