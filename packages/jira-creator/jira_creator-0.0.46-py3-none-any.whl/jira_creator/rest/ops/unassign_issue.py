If successful, it returns True. If an error occurs during the unassignment process, it raises an UnassignIssueError.

Arguments:
- request_fn (function): A function used to make API requests.
- issue_key (str): The key of the issue to unassign.

Return:
- bool: True if the issue was successfully unassigned.

Exceptions:
- UnassignIssueError: Raised if there is an issue with unassigning the specified issue.
