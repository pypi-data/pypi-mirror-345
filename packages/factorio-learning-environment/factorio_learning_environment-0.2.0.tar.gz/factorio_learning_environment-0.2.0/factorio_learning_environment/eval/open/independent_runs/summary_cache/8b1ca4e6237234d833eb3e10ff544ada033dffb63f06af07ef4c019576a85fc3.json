{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) and (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Area at Position (x=7.5, y=-61.5) and (x=6.5, y=-59.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=7.5, y=-61.5).\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=6.5, y=-59.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Inserter System at Position (x=6.5, y=-60.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at Position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to small electric poles and a wooden chest.\n\n### Lab at Position (x=6.5, y=-59.5)\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.5), not connected to the power network.\n- Boiler at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0), not connected, with no input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), not connected.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=-9.5, y=22.5) with multiple pipes connecting various entities, currently empty.\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=1.5, y=22.5) with a single pipe, currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with multiple small electric poles, currently not providing power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure the target position for placing pipes is clear of any existing entities or water. Remove any existing objects or choose a different location before attempting to place pipes.\n\n### Errors when connecting power entities\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when connecting small electric poles. Verify that the path between entities is clear and that the poles are correctly aligned to establish a connection."}
