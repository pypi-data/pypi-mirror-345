{"content": "The error indicates that the boiler could not be placed because the player is too far from the target position. Additionally, the inventory lacks the necessary pipes to craft a boiler. Let's address these issues step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Craft the Required Pipes\n- The boiler recipe requires 4 pipes, but the inventory currently has none.\n- Pipes are crafted from iron plates, and you have 4 iron plates in the inventory.\n\n```python\n# Craft the required number of pipes\nrequired_pipes = 4\ncrafted_pipes = craft_item(Prototype.Pipe, quantity=required_pipes)\nassert crafted_pipes >= required_pipes, \"Failed to craft the necessary pipes.\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Move Closer to the Placement Location\n- Ensure you are within the placement range for the boiler.\n\n```python\n# Move closer to the desired placement position for the boiler\nmove_to(Position(x=-11.0, y=0.0))  # Adjust this position based on the actual water location\n```\n\n### Step 3: Craft and Place the Boiler\n- Now that you have the necessary components, craft the boiler.\n\n```python\n# Craft the boiler now that we have the necessary components\nboiler_crafted = craft_item(Prototype.Boiler)\nassert boiler_crafted >= 1, \"Failed to craft the Boiler.\"\n\n# Place the boiler at the desired position\nboiler_position = nearest(Resource.Water).right()  # Adjust based on actual water location\nboiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\nassert boiler, \"Failed to place the Boiler after crafting.\"\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify and Continue Setup\n- Check the inventory and entities to ensure everything is in place.\n\n```python\n# Final check of inventory and entities\nprint(f\"Updated Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on map after setup: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to craft and place the boiler successfully. Make sure to adjust the movement and placement positions based on the actual layout of your environment.", "summary_range": "[1-150]"}
