{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and a status of working. The drill has a warning indicating the output is blocked by an item on the ground, and there is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace has a status of no ingredients to smelt and a warning indicating no ingredients are available.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing entities or items on the ground that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by checking the map for the entity's presence to avoid exceptions related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage\n- Ensure that the output of a mining drill is not blocked by items on the ground. Consider placing a chest or transport belt to collect or move the output efficiently.\n\n### Errors with insufficient ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and supply the required resources to prevent idle status due to missing ingredients."}
