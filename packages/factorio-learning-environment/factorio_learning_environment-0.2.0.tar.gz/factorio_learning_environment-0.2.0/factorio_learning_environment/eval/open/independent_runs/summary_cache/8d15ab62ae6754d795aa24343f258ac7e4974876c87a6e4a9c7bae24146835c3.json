{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Verify the inserter's alignment and ensure it is correctly positioned to transfer items from the source to the destination. Regularly check and adjust the inserter setup if items are not being transferred as expected.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Ensure all entities that require fuel, such as burner inserters and mining drills, are consistently refueled to maintain continuous operation."}
