{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for extracting iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracts iron ore and deposits it into adjacent wooden chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) store the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transfers iron ore from the chests to the stone furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) smelt iron ore into iron plates. The furnace at (-12.0, -48.0) is currently full with iron plates, while the furnace at (-10.0, -48.0) is also full with iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), and (-5.5, -48.5) store the produced iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Ore Transfer System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) moves iron ore from the wooden chests to another storage chest at position (-14.5, -46.5).\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage System\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -47.5) and (-7.5, -47.5) are used for storing iron plates. The chest at (-6.5, -47.5) contains 465 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity to ensure it is not empty.\n\n#### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly check and clear the output of the furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Consider using inserters to automatically transfer items from the furnace output to storage chests.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the destination entity for the inserter to place items. Regularly clear the destination inventory or use additional storage solutions to prevent blockages.\n\n#### Refueling Burner Mining Drill\n- Regularly refuel the burner mining drill to ensure continuous operation. Monitor the fuel levels and replenish them as needed to prevent downtime."}
