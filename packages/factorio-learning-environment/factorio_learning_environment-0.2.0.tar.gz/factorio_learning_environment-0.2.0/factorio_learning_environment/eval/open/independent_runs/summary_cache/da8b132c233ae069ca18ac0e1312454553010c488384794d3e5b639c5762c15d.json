{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron and Copper Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and currently containing iron ore and copper plate. This furnace is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) which is responsible for drawing water but currently not connected to any fluid system.\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) fueled with coal, intended to convert water into steam for power generation, but currently not connected to any water source or steam output.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting and Resource Gathering\n- Ensure all required raw materials are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, stone must be gathered before crafting a stone furnace, and iron plates are required for crafting pipes.\n- When crafting items that require sub-ingredients, verify that all sub-ingredients are available in the inventory or can be crafted.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before placing entities like boilers, ensure that there is enough space and that the area is suitable for placement. Avoid placing entities in areas occupied by water or other obstacles.\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the entity to be placed, as attempting to place an entity not in the inventory will result in failure.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that all necessary items, such as pipes, are available in the inventory before attempting to connect entities like offshore pumps and boilers.\n- Verify that the entities are correctly aligned and positioned to allow for successful connections.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items\n- Verify that the target entity contains the items intended for extraction. Attempting to extract items from an empty or incorrect entity will result in failure.\n\n### Type Errors in Code\n- When performing operations involving attributes, ensure that the data types are compatible. For example, avoid adding integers to attributes that are not directly compatible with numerical operations."}
