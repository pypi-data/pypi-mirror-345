{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled with coal (6 units), currently working but output blocked due to no sink entity accepting output  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal (34 units), currently working but source and output inventories are full  \n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from mining drill to furnace, fueled with coal (49 units), waiting due to blocked furnace belt at drop position  \n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from assembling machine, fueled with coal (49 units), waiting for source items  \n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into assembling machine, fueled with coal (49 units), waiting for source items  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, not receiving electricity and lacking iron plates (needs 2)  \n- Small electric poles at positions (21.5, 75.5), (18.5, 72.5), and (18.5, 75.5) providing electricity connections, but assembler still has no power  \n- Newly placed steam engine and boiler pair for power generation (positions not specified in logs), intended to energize the factory but assembler remains unpowered  \n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power  \n- Electric poles are placed and connected, and steam engine and boiler were placed to provide power, yet the assembling machine remains without power.  \n- Verify that the steam engine and boiler are correctly connected to the electric poles network that includes the assembler.  \n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly fueled and operational to generate electricity.  \n- Check that all electric poles form a continuous and energized network covering the assembler and inserters.  \n- Ensure no missing connections or gaps in the power grid that prevent power delivery.  \n\n### Errors due to burner inserters running out of fuel and fuel insertion failures  \n- Burner inserters initially ran out of coal, causing stoppages. Coal was harvested and inserted into several burner inserters successfully.  \n- However, some attempts to insert coal failed due to insufficient coal in inventory at insertion time.  \n- Maintain a sufficient coal buffer in inventory before attempting fuel insertion.  \n- Automate coal supply to burner inserters or transition to electric inserters once power is stable to avoid fuel starvation.  \n\n### Errors related to offshore pump placement and crafting  \n- Attempts to place offshore pump for power generation failed due to no offshore pump in inventory.  \n- Crafting offshore pump failed because required sub-ingredients (electronic circuits, copper cables, copper plates) could not be crafted due to missing crafting machines or smelting setups for copper plates.  \n- Establish copper plate production line with furnaces and assembling machines to enable crafting of copper cables and electronic circuits.  \n- Stockpile or craft offshore pumps before attempting placement to avoid placement errors.  \n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs and full inventories  \n- Burner mining drill output remains blocked due to no sink entity accepting its output, causing production halts.  \n- Stone furnace source and output inventories are full, indicating downstream bottlenecks.  \n- Inserters feeding the furnace and assembling machine are waiting due to blocked belts or lack of source items.  \n- Ensure downstream storage or processing entities are available and have capacity to accept items.  \n- Clear inventories or expand storage to maintain smooth production flow.  \n\n### General placement and connection error tips  \n- Confirm target tiles are free before placing entities to avoid placement failures.  \n- Verify assembling machine recipes and power connections before starting production.  \n- Use inserters between furnaces and belts rather than connecting belts directly to furnaces to avoid blockages.  \n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
