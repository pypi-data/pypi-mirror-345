{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently fueled by coal and actively working.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5): Feeds iron ore into the stone furnace. Fueled by coal and operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-2.5, 0.5): Collects iron plates from the burner inserter. Currently contains iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an entity that does not contain them\n- Verify that the entity contains the desired items before attempting to extract them. An error occurred when trying to extract iron plates from the furnace when none were available.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Confirm that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For instance, trying to insert coal into an inserter or iron ore into a furnace without having them in the inventory led to errors.\n\n### Errors when using uninitialized or incorrect API calls\n- Ensure that all API calls are correctly initialized and that the objects being manipulated are valid. An error was encountered when attempting to connect entities with an uninitialized or incorrect attribute."}
