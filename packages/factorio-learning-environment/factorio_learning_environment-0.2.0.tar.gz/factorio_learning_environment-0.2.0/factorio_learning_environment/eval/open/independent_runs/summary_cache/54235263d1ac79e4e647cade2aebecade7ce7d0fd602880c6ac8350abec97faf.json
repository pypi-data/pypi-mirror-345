{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-5.5, 0.0) (currently working with 21 coal)\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 0.5) (working status)\n- Connected pipe network (fluid system 427) spanning multiple positions\n- Small electric pole at (-1.5, 2.5) providing power distribution\n\n### Pipe Network (fluid system 427)\n- Extensive pipe connections between power generation components\n- Key pipe positions: (-8.5,-0.5), (-7.5,-0.5), (-5.5,-1.5), (2.5,-0.5), (-7.5,0.5), (1.5,0.5)\n- Carrying steam at 165\u00b0 temperature\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network (id 4169)\n- Multiple small electric poles spanning across the map\n- Key pole positions: (6.5,66.5), (27.5,66.5), (8.5,68.5), (24.5,25.5), (-1.5,26.5), (26.5,27.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Build location finding failures (repeated in steps 16-23)\n- Implement more robust location scanning algorithms that account for:\n  - Existing entity footprints\n  - Terrain obstacles\n  - Power network proximity\n  - Resource patch locations\n- Consider pre-scanning and caching valid build areas\n- Implement fallback location strategies when primary locations fail\n\n### Power system maintenance\n- Monitor boiler fuel levels (currently 21 coal) to prevent power interruptions\n- Verify all pipe connections remain intact after modifications\n- Maintain proper steam temperature and flow rates\n\n### General construction improvements\n- Implement entity placement validation before attempting builds\n- Develop better error recovery when placement fails\n- Consider building in less congested areas first\n\n### Previous error tips still applicable:\n- Belt connection validation\n- Entity placement checks\n- Mining operation setup\n- Power system connections\n- Code implementation practices"}
