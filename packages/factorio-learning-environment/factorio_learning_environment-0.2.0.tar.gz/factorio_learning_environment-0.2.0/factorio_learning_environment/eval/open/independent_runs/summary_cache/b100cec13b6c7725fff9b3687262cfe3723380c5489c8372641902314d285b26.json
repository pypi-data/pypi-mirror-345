{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Iron Ore Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0)**\n  - Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n  - Connected to an iron-chest at (-16.5, -48.5) and a wooden-chest at (-14.5, -48.5).\n  - Warnings indicate the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n- **Iron Ore Storage and Processing**\n  - Iron-chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), and (-15.5, -48.5) for iron ore storage.\n  - Stone furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Wooden-chests at positions (-14.5, -49.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution\n- **Coal Storage Facility**\n  - Iron-chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), and (45.5, -80.5) for coal storage.\n  - Wooden-chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional coal storage.\n\n- **Coal Distribution System**\n  - Burner inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring coal between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\n- **Iron Plate Production**\n  - Stone furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) connected with a burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) for processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Iron-chests at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (42.5, -80.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Avoid placing entities where there are existing objects.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities. Regularly check your inventory levels to avoid running out of critical resources like iron ore.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- Verify the existence of entities at the specified positions before attempting to interact with them. This can prevent errors related to missing or non-existent entities."}
