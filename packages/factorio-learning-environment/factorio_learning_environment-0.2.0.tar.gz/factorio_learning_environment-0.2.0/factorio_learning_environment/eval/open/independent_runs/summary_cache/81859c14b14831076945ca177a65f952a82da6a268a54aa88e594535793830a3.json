{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5) feeding the furnace\n- Burner Inserter at position (-7.5, -49.5) connected to a wooden chest at position (-8.5, -49.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-5.5, -49.5) with no specified connection\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the furnace, consisting of belts at positions:\n  - Belt at position (-14.5, -54.5)\n  - Belt at position (-13.5, -54.5)\n  - Belt at position (-12.5, -54.5)\n  - Belt at position (-15.5, -52.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Connection of Belts to Stone Furnace\n- Ensure that belts are not directly connected to a stone furnace. Use an inserter to transfer items from a belt to a stone furnace.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Refueling\n- Before attempting to refuel entities, ensure that there is enough coal or other necessary resources in your inventory to complete the action.\n\n### Low Iron Plate Production\n- Investigate the iron plate production line to ensure all components are functioning correctly and are adequately fueled. Check for any blockages or inefficiencies in the transport system."}
