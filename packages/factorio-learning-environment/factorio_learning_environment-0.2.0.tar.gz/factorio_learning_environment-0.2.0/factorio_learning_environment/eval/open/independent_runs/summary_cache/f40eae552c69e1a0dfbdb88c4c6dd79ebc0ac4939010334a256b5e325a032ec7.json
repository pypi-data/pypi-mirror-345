Consider rearranging existing structures or clearing space to accommodate new inserters.\n\n### Errors due to lack of electricity\n- Verify that all electrical entities are connected to a power source. Ensure that the electricity network is complete and that there are no gaps in the connection.\n\n### Errors due to missing resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are available for the assembling machines and furnaces. Regularly check and replenish resources to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Check that all fuel-based entities, such as boilers and burner mining drills, have adequate fuel to function. Regularly supply coal or other fuels to these entities to avoid interruptions."}
