{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the current steps. All attempts to place entities have resulted in errors, and the map remains empty of structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple errors indicate attempts to place entities like Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and inserters at various coordinates, all of which failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors with position handling\n- Correctly handle position objects and ensure that indices are integers. Errors such as \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" suggest improper handling of position data types.\n\n### Errors with function calls\n- Ensure that objects intended to be used as callable functions are correctly defined and used. Errors like \"'Position' object is not callable\" indicate misuse of objects as functions.\n\n### Errors with buildable area\n- When using functions like `nearest_buildable`, ensure the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. If no viable place is found, consider decreasing the BuildingBox size or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to fit the available area."}
