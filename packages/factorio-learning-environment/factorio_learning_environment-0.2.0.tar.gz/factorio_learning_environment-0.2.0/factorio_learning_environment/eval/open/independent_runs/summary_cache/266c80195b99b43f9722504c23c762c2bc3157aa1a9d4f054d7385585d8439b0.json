{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-16.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a source of iron ore and a result of iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with a source of iron ore and a result of iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (-14.0, -49.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (-16.0, -49.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) containing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnaces and inserters, facilitating the movement of iron plates and ore between entities.\n- Multiple belts connecting various positions, including:\n  - Belt from (-16.5, -48.5) to (-16.5, -46.5).\n  - Belt from (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -47.5).\n  - Belt from (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -43.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available at the pickup position for the inserters to function correctly. Check upstream entities such as mining drills or input chests to ensure they are supplying resources.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Misaligned\n- Regularly check the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Misalignment can cause them to wait indefinitely for source items.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Blocked by Items\n- Ensure there is a clear path for inserters to drop items. If an inserter is blocked, it may be due to items on the ground or a lack of sink entities to accept the output. Clear any blockages and ensure there is a destination for items.\n\n### Errors with Output Blocked by Items on the Ground\n- Regularly clear items on the ground that may block inserters from functioning. Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from inserters to prevent blockages."}
