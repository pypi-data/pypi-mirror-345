{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -47.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -49.5) to transfer iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace\n\nThis structure is designed to extract iron ore using the burner mining drill, transfer it to the stone furnace using the burner inserter, and smelt it into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting due to missing resources\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates require smelting iron ore in a furnace, and stone must be gathered as it is a raw resource.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to inventory shortages\n- Verify that the entity you wish to place is available in your inventory. Attempting to place an entity like a stone furnace without having it in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target tile is free. If another entity occupies the space, adjust the position, spacing, or direction to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available resources\n- Confirm that the items you intend to insert are present in your inventory. Attempting to insert items like iron ore into a furnace without having them will cause an error.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity to accept the output from production entities like mining drills. If the output is blocked, the entity will not function properly.\n\n### Errors due to inserter misalignment\n- Align inserters correctly to ensure they can pick up and drop items as intended. Adjust the inserter's position and direction to align with the source and destination entities."}
