{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Smelting Setup at position (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at (-13.0, -50.0) now operating with fuel (coal: 25) and producing batches of iron plates (most recent batch: 10 iron plates).\n- Burner Inserter at (-16.5, -49.5) with configured pickup at (-17.5, -49.5) and drop at (-15.5, -49.5) remains in place.\n- Updated transfer mechanism:\n  \u2022 New collection chest placed at (-12.5, -48.5) now collects iron plates from the furnace.\n  \u2022 New burner inserter at (-10.5, -49.5) rotated to transfer items from the furnace (at (-13.0, -50.0)) to the new collection chest.\n- BeltGroup connections remain as previously configured, linking furnace output to source positions for inserters.\n- Additional burner inserter at (-9.5, -49.5) (transferring items further downstream) remains.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup with Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at (-15.0, -50.0) (noted with an \"out of fuel\" warning).\n- Sink Wooden Chest at (-15.5, -51.5) collecting mined ore.\n\n### Additional Logistic Chest\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5) serving as auxiliary storage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Transfer and Smelting Timing Issues:\n  \u2022 When crafting transport belts, ensure that the furnace produces and transfers sufficient iron plates. Verify that manual extractions and transfer insertions occur after production stabilizes.\n  \u2022 Smelting timeouts occur if the furnace does not produce expected iron plates. Confirm that the furnace receives proper inputs and an adequate supply of fuel.\n- Fuel Insertion Failures:\n  \u2022 Inserting coal into the furnace and the mining drill failed due to lack of available coal. Ensure a timely check of the inventory for coal before initiating such insertions.\n  \u2022 Multiple burner inserters and the mining drill display low-fuel warnings. Regularly verify fuel levels and preload sufficient fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n- Component Connection Issues:\n  \u2022 Changing collection chests and reconfiguring transfer inserter positions require verifying target placement positions are unoccupied and correctly aligned with the reference furnace output.\n  \nAll previous observed errors remain relevant and should be monitored for consistent refueling and timely transfer of produced items."}
