{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions for water and steam flow\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) storing coal\n- Burner Inserter at Position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) moving items from a pickup position at (x=53.5, y=-83.5) to a drop position at (x=55.5, y=-83.5)\n- BeltGroup transporting coal along various belt positions\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=0.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates\n- Additional Iron Chests at Positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently without power\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various positions to form an electricity network, currently not powered\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-consuming entities, such as boilers and burner mining drills, have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and refill fuel as needed.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage chest inventories to prevent them from becoming full. Empty chests at drop positions to continue mining or production processes.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connection\n- Ensure that all power-producing entities, such as steam engines, are connected to the power network and have input liquids to generate electricity.\n\n### Errors with Resource Flow\n- Verify that all belts and inserters are correctly positioned and functioning to maintain a smooth flow of resources between entities."}
