{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine:\n  - Water PipeGroup at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5) with pipes [(x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), ..., (x=-5.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=24.5)]\n  - Steam PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=22.5) with pipes [(x=-0.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), ..., (x=3.5, y=24.5), (x=5.5, y=24.5), (x=4.5, y=24.5)]\n- Small Electric Poles connecting steam engine to lab\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with inventory containing copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, connected to the electricity network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with Boiler Dimensions\n- Ensure that the correct attributes are being accessed from the Prototype.Boiler.entity_class. Verify that 'tile_dimensions' is a valid attribute.\n\n### Type Errors with Boiler Width Calculations\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that the operands are of compatible types. Convert 'ModelPrivateAttr' to a compatible type before performing arithmetic.\n\n### Connection Errors Due to Missing Items\n- Before attempting to connect entities, verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory. For example, ensure pipes are available before connecting an offshore pump to a boiler.\n\n### Crafting and Resource Shortages\n- Regularly check inventory levels to ensure sufficient resources for crafting. For example, ensure enough wood and copper cables are available to craft small electric poles.\n\n### Lab Connection and Status Errors\n- Ensure that the lab is correctly connected to the power network and that the required research packs are available. Verify that the lab entity exists at the specified position before checking its status.\n\n### Name Errors in Variable Definitions\n- Double-check variable names for accuracy and ensure they are defined before use. For example, ensure 'copper_cable_needed_for_poles' is defined and correctly named.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly monitor fuel levels in boilers and ensure a steady supply of coal to prevent power outages."}
