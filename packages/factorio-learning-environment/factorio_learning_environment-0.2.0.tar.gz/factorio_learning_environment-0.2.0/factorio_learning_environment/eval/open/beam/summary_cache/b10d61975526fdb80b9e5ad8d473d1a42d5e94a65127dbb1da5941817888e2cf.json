{"content": "It seems that the output is not progressing beyond the initial print statement, \"Starting diagnostic procedure...\". This indicates that the script is either not executing further or the subsequent print statements are not being captured. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Silent Failures**: Ensure that the environment is not silently failing due to an error that is not being caught. The try-except blocks should catch most exceptions, but it's possible that the error is occurring in a way that isn't being captured.\n\n2. **Add More Debugging Statements**: Insert additional print statements at key points in the code to determine how far the execution is proceeding. For example, add prints after each entity retrieval and before each connection attempt.\n\n3. **Verify Entity Retrieval**: Double-check that the `get_entities` function is correctly retrieving entities. If any entity is missing, the script will not proceed as expected. Ensure that the game environment is correctly set up with all required entities.\n\n4. **Check for Blocking Operations**: Ensure that operations like `move_to` are not blocking indefinitely. If the agent is unable to reach the boiler, it might halt execution.\n\n5. **Environment Logs**: If available, check any logs or console outputs from the environment itself to see if there are errors or warnings that aren't being captured by the script.\n\n6. **Simplify the Script**: Temporarily simplify the script to isolate the issue. For example, comment out sections and run only the entity retrieval part to see if it progresses further.\n\nHere's a simplified version with additional debugging statements:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting diagnostic procedure...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Attempt to retrieve necessary entities\n    offshore_pump_entity = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    print(\"Offshore Pump retrieved.\")\n    if not offshore_pump_entity:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Offshore Pump not found!\")\n\n    boiler_entity = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    print(\"Boiler retrieved.\")\n    if not boiler_entity:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Boiler not found!\")\n\n    steam_engine_entity = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    print(\"Steam Engine retrieved.\")\n    if not steam_engine_entity:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Steam Engine not found!\")\n\n    electric_pole_entity = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    print(\"Electric Pole retrieved.\")\n    if not electric_pole_entity:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Electric Pole not found!\")\n\n    assembling_machine_entity = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n    print(\"Assembling Machine retrieved.\")\n    if not assembling_machine_entity:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Assembling Machine not found!\")\n\n    print(\"All necessary entities found.\")\n\n    # Use first entity from each list\n    offshore_pump = offshore_pump_entity[0]\n    boiler = boiler_entity[0]\n    steam_engine = steam_engine_entity[0]\n    electric_pole = electric_pole_entity[0]\n    assembling_machine = assembling_machine_entity[0]\n\n    # Navigate to the boiler and inspect its fuel\n    move_to(boiler.position)\n    print(\"Moved to boiler.\")\n    current_coal = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    print(f\"Current Boiler Coal Level: {current_coal}\")\n\n    # Refuel the boiler if necessary\n    if current_coal < 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, 10 - current_coal)\n        current_coal = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n        print(f\"Boiler refueled.
