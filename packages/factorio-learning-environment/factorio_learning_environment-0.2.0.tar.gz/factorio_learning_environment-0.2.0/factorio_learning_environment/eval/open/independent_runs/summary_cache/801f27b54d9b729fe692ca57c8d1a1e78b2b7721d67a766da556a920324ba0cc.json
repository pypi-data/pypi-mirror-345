Verify that the fluid_system ID specified corresponds to an active and properly configured PipeGroup before initiating connection operations.\n   \n\u2022 Fixed Delay Limitations for Pipeline Stabilization:\n   - Using a fixed 10-second delay after connection attempts has not ensured pipeline stability. Implement dynamic readiness checks to confirm pipeline stabilization prior to retrying connection operations."}
