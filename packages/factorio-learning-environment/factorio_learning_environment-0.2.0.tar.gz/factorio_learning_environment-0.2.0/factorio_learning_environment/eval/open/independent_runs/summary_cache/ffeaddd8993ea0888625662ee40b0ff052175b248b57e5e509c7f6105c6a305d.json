{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is currently working and has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional chests at various positions (e.g., x=5.5, y=-60.5; x=7.5, y=-60.5) containing iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - Furnace at (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with a warning that the furnace result is full.\n  - Furnaces at (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- **Iron Chest** at position (x=-3.5, y=-52.5) containing iron plates.\n- Additional **Wooden Chests** at positions (e.g., x=-4.5, y=-52.5; x=-5.5, y=-52.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel a burner mining drill. This will prevent failed refueling attempts due to lack of coal.\n\n### Warnings about Full Output\n- Regularly empty the output of furnaces to avoid warnings about full output, which can halt production.\n\n### Warnings about No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to avoid warnings about no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the player's inventory items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
