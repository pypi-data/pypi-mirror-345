{"content": "I notice that we've successfully:\n1. Found iron ore at (-19.5, 19.5)\n2. Placed a stone furnace\n3. Added coal for fuel\n4. Added iron ore to smelt\n5. The furnace is now working (status='WORKING')\n\nLet's try to create a more automated setup using a burner mining drill:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Find iron ore patch\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Found iron ore at: {iron_pos}\")\n\n# Place mining drill on iron ore\ndrill = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, position=iron_pos)\nprint(f\"Placed mining drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to mining drill\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to mining drill\")\n\n# Place furnace next to drill's output\nfurnace_pos = Position(x=drill.drop_position.x + 2, y=drill.drop_position.y)\nfurnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_pos)\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n# Check status of both entities\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {furnace.status}\")\n```\n\nThis should create an automated setup where:\n1. The mining drill extracts iron ore\n2. The furnace is positioned to receive the ore\n3. Both are fueled with coal\n4. The furnace will smelt the iron ore into iron plates", "summary_range": "[1-2496]"}
