{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Pipe Group connecting various positions:\n  - Pipe at (-4.5, 16.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe at (-9.5, 23.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT\n  - Pipe at (-7.5, 24.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe at (-4.5, 24.5) - Status: EMPTY\n- Electricity Group at position (-3.6667, 20.2143) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Status: NO_INGREDIENTS or WORKING, depending on the step\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes or pipe-to-ground does not overlap with water or other entities. Consider repositioning or clearing the area before placement.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to place or connect pipes, verify that the required items are available in the inventory. If not, craft or acquire the necessary items first.\n\n### Errors with Entity Connections\n- Steam engines and boilers need to be properly connected to function. Ensure that all components of the electricity generator are connected and that the electricity network is properly established.\n\n### Errors in Crafting\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items. For example, iron plates are necessary for crafting certain items and should be smelted in a furnace if unavailable.\n\n### Errors with API Usage\n- Double-check the API calls and attributes being used. For instance, ensure correct attribute names are used, such as 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround'.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that all preconditions are met before executing assertions, such as having iron ore available for smelting."}
