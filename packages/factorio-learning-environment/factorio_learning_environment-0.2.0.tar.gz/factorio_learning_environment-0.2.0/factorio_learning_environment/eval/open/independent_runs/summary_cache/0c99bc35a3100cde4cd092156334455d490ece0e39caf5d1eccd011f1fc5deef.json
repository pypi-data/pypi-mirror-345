Validate the current active identifier from the working PipeGroup (now 32444) before attempting a connection.\n- Rigid Pipeline Stabilization:\n  - Repeated use of fixed 10-second delays for pipeline stabilization leads to avoidable waiting. Replace static delays with dynamic checks that proceed immediately once connectivity is confirmed."}
