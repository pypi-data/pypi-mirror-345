{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe connections between these components to transport water and steam.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) for ore collection.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) and another at Position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) for moving items.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storage.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (unknown) with input for automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups for fluid transportation, with various statuses indicating empty or full conditions.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles spanning various positions, providing electrical connections to powered entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough resources, such as copper plates, before attempting to craft items. Check inventory levels regularly to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Furnace Not Working\n- Verify that furnaces have the required ingredients and are properly fueled to maintain operational status. Ensure that the copper furnace is working by checking its status and input materials.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check fuel levels in entities like boilers and burner mining drills. Refill them with appropriate fuel to prevent operational halts.\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Ensure that all electrical components, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a power network. Check for any disconnected poles or insufficient power supply.\n\n### Full Output and No Ingredients Warnings\n- Empty output chests regularly to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage. Ensure furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Crafting Failures\n- Ensure you have all necessary components and resources before crafting. The failure to craft electronic circuits indicates missing ingredients or insufficient resources."}
