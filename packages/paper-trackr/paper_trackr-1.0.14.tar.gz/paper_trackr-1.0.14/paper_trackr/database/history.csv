However, the heterogeneity of GC and their molecular characteristics are still largely unexplored.We employed single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to comprehensively map the intra-tumoural heterogeneity within GC. Additionally, in vitro experiments, clinical sample analyses, and patient-derived organoid models (PDOs) were conducted to validate the key interaction patterns between tumor cells and stromal cells.Seven robust meta-programs (MP1-MP7) in GC were defined with distinct biological significance and spatial distributions. MP3 and MP4 were intimately associated with distinct CD8 T cells skewed toward a cytotoxic or exhaustion state, while MP7, characterised by the highest degree of malignancy, harboured an immune lockdown microenvironment around it and spatially associated with myofibroblasts (myCAFs). Notably, we clarified the interplay between the MP7 and myCAFs, where MP7 induces the chemotactic migration of fibroblasts and promoting their transformation into myCAFs via GDF15/TGFBR2, and in turn, myCAFs-derived RSPO3 up-regulates EGR1 to promote the transformation to MP7 in GC cells and human PDOs. Ultimately, the accumulation of myCAFs around MP7 led to fewer infiltration of CD8 T cells, resulting an immune-deprived microenvironment and the diminished efficacy of immunotherapy. Additionally, based on the gene expression signatures of MP7 GC cells, we predicted specific drugs and verified more potent inhibitory effects of Taselisib and Lapatinib for MP7 GC cells than conventional drugs at the same concentration.Taken together, these results deepened the understanding of GC heterogeneity and paved the way for novel therapeutic strategies by targeting MP7 GC cells and their interaction loop with myCAFs in GC treatment.Seven robust meta-programs (MP1-MP7) were identified in gastric cancer. MP7 was strongly correlated with cancer metastasis and poor survival of gastric cancer patients. MP7 promoted fibroblast transformation into myCAFs via GDF15/TGFBR2, creating an immune lockdown microenvironment. MyCAFs induced MP7 transformation via the RSPO3/EGR1 pathway, promoting gastric cancer cell migration.

Several studies have indicated that pyroptosis is one of the key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AR. However, no research has investigated the molecular targets of pyroptosis in the context of AR. Our study endeavored to identify common biomarkers and mechanisms that could offer insights into the prevention of AR progression and novel therapeutic targets. Data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including GSE51392, GSE43523, and GSE44037, were downloaded and analyzed through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and random forest (RF) analysis to identify key intersecting genes associated with both AR and pyroptosis. The gene GZMA was identified as a significant candidate and was validated in another sample dataset (GSE101720). Western blot (WB) analysis confirmed the expression of GZMA in an AR mouse model. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were conducted to explore the functional roles of the shared genes. An immune infiltration matrix was established using CIBERSORT analysis to estimate the degree of immune cell infiltration in AR. Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) was performed to analyze the biological functions of hub genes. In the immune infiltration matrix of AR, a reduced expression of Tregs was observed in the AR group. WB analysis further indicated elevated expression of GZMA in the AR group. As a gene related to both AR and pyroptosis, GZMA expression was positively correlated with the gene expression levels of CD8 + T cells. The reduction in Tregs and the increase in CD8 + T cells in AR, along with enhanced pyroptosis, contribute to the development of allergic inflammation. Therefore, it was hypothesized that GZMA could serve as a novel target for the prevention and treatment of AR.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40307356/,"machine learning, bioinformatics, genomics"

The ability to diagnose MMD early and develop personalized treatment plans can significantly improve the prognosis of patients. Here, we have introduced the research on MMD biomarkers. By integrating proteomics and metabolomics data, we have successfully identified over 1700 features from more than 60 serum samples collected at the onset of symptoms in MMD patients. We use multiple computational strategies to interpret complex information in serum, providing a comprehensive perspective for early diagnosis of MMD. Diagnostic ability of our biomarker is significantly better than previous studies, especially when used in combination. In the study of molecular mechanisms, we found that the ferroptosis pathway was significant disruption in MMD patients, which was also confirmed by transcriptomics data. Finally, we validated the metabolites and proteins associated with ferroptosis pathways, as well as the biomarkers screened by machine learning, using another independent MMD cohort.

Phenotype-based methods commonly rely on comparing phenotypes observed in a patient with databases of genotype-to-phenotype associations using measures of semantic similarity. They are constrained by the quality and completeness of these resources as well as the quality and completeness of patient phenotype annotation. Genotype-to-phenotype associations used by these methods are largely derived from the literature and coded using phenotype ontologies. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been trained on large amounts of text and data and have shown their potential to answer complex questions across multiple domains. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in prioritizing disease-associated genes compared to existing bioinformatics methods. We show that LLMs can prioritize disease-associated genes as well, or better than, dedicated bioinformatics methods relying on pre-defined phenotype similarity, when gene sets range from 5 to 100 candidates. We apply our approach to a cohort of undiagnosed patients with rare diseases and show that LLMs can be used to provide diagnostic support that helps in identifying plausible candidate genes. Our results show that LLMs may offer an alternative to traditional bioinformatics methods to prioritize disease-associated genes based on disease phenotypes.

To minimize issues with sample heterogeneity and additional freeze-thaw cycles during sample splitting, multiple -omics datasets (e.g. metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics) should ideally be generated from the same set of samples. For sample extraction, commonly biphasic organic solvent systems are used that require extensive multi-step protocols. Individual studies have recently also started to investigate monophasic (all-in-one) extraction procedures. The aim of the current study was to develop and systematically compare ten different mono- and biphasic extraction solvent mixtures for their potential to aid in the most comprehensive metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics datasets. As the focus was on human postmortem tissue samples (muscle and liver tissue), four tissue homogenization parameters were also evaluated. Untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, lipidomic and proteomics methods were utilized along with 1D sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay results.

The supernatant of the homogenate was further extracted. Comprehensive ranking, taking nine different processing parameters into account, showed that the monophasic extraction solvents, overall, showed better scores compared to the biphasic solvent systems, despite their recommendation for one or all of the -omics extractions.

S. K., Rodriguez, A. L., Bosilevac, J. M., Eppinger, M.",bioRxiv,2025-05-01,,"Non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), particularly the O118 serogroup, are emerging pathogens linked to severe foodborne illnesses, including hemolytic uremic syndrome. The hallmark of STEC virulence is the production of a potent phage-borne cytotoxin, often accompanied by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). This study explores the genomic landscape, virulence factors, and resistance traits of O118 STEC. We analyzed 357 publicly available O118 genomes across ten H-antigens and included two clinically significant O118:H16 STEC strains sequenced to closure. Pangenome assessment and core genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on 4,160 shared genes revealed phylogenetic clustering by H-type and delineated distinct STEC-phylogroups, alongside relationships to non-STEC pathovars such as uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Identified STEC phylogroups encompassed H6, H12, H16, and H2 strains with diverse Shiga toxin (stx) profiles (stx1a, stx2a, stx2b, stx2c, stx2f). A subset of H2-STEC lacked stx, suggesting potential secondary phage loss. Most STEC groups harbored the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Further, a strong correlation was observed between H-antigens and eae subtypes, with specific pairings such as H6/eae-{iota}, H16/eae-{beta}, and H2/eae-{varepsilon}. Horizontally acquired pathogenicity islands-including O-island 122 in H16 strains and a novel pathogenicity-associated island carrying antibiotic resistance-along with other loci related to colonization and interbacterial competition, further enhance these strains' virulence potential. Our findings underscore the genetic diversity and virulence potential of O118 STEC.

H., Butler, G.",bioRxiv,2025-05-01,,"Candida parapsilosis is an opportunistic yeast pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections in immunocompromised humans. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies of the species have demonstrated remarkably low diversity, with strains typically differing by about 1.5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per 10 kb. However, SNP calling alone does not capture the full extent of genetic variation. Here, we define the pangenome of 372 C. parapsilosis isolates to determine variation in gene content. The pangenome consists of 5,859 genes, of which 48 are not found in the genome of the reference strain. This includes 5,791 core genes (present in [≥] 99.5% of isolates). Four genes, including the allantoin permease gene DAL4, were present in all isolates but were truncated in some strains. The truncated DAL4 was classified as a pseudogene in the reference strain CDC317. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing showed that removing the early stop codon (producing the full-length Dal4 protein) is associated with improved use of allantoin as a sole nitrogen source. We find that the accessory genome of C. parapsilosis consists of 68 homologous clusters. This includes 38 previously annotated genes, 27 novel paralogs of previously annotated genes and 3 uncharacterised ORFs. Approximately one-third of the accessory genome (24/68 genes) is associated with gene fusions between tandem genes in the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Additionally, we identified two highly divergent C. parapsilosis strains and find that, despite their increased phylogenetic distance (~30 SNPs per 10 kb), both strains have similar gene content to the other 372.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651475v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics"

The PBS cores contain 2-5 allophycocyanin cylinders that are organized by ApcE. At the present, structures of PBS with tricylindrical and pentacylindrical cores have been determined while the structure of the PBS with a bicylindrical core is yet to be revealed. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of PBS with bicylindrical core from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (Synechococcus 7942) at 2.98 [A] resolution. Similar to the PBS with a tricylindrical core, six peripheral rods are attached to the core by the rod-core linker protein CpcG in the PBS of Synechococcus 7942 even though the core lacks the top AP cylinder, which is important for the attachment of peripheral rods to the tricylindrical cores. We found that the C-terminus of ApcE in the Synechococcus 7942 was involved in interacting with both CpcG and CpcB of a top peripheral rod, compensating for the absence of the top AP cylinder of the core and maintaining PBS stability. Analysis of the bilin distribution reveals that distance of excitation energy transfer from top peripheral rods to the terminal emitters is approximately 15% shorter compared to the PBS with tricylindrical cores. Although there are 30% fewer bilin chromophores in the Synechococcus 7942 PBS core compared with the tricylindrical core, the aromatic residue ring in the Synechococcus 7942 PBS core is conserved, supporting the suggestion that these aromatic residues from AP and linker proteins are critical to the energy transfer of PBS.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.28.650843v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics, plant biology"

F.",bioRxiv,2025-05-01,,"Aggressive cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), are often characterized by a complex and desmoplastic tumor microenvironment rich in stroma, a supportive connective tissue composed primarily of extracellular matrix (ECM) and non-cancerous cells. Desmoplasia, which is a dense deposition of stroma, is a major reason for therapy resistance, acting both as a physical barrier that interferes with drug penetration and as a supportive niche that protects cancer cells through diverse mechanisms. A precise understanding of spatial cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment in stroma-rich cancers is essential for optimizing therapeutic responses. It allows detailed mapping of stromal-tumor interfaces, comprehensive phenotyping of diverse cell types and their functional states, and insights into changes in cellular distribution and tissue architecture, thus leading to an improved assessment of drug responses. Recent advances in multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging have enabled the acquisition of large batches of whole-slide tumor images, but scalable and reproducible methods to analyze the spatial distribution of cell states relative to stromal regions remain limited. To address this gap, we developed an open-source computational pipeline that integrates QuPath (Bankhead et al. 2017), StarDist (Schmidt et al. 2018), and custom Python scripts to quantify biomarker expression at a single- and sub-cellular resolution across entire tumor sections. Our workflow includes: (i) automated nuclei segmentation using StarDist, (ii) machine learning-based cell classification using multiplexed marker expression, (iii) modeling of stromal regions based on fibronectin staining, (iv) sensitivity analyses on classification thresholds to ensure robustness across heterogeneous datasets, and (v) distance-based quantification of the proximity of each cell to the stromal border. To improve consistency across slides with variable staining intensities, we introduce a statistical strategy that translates classification thresholds by propagating a chosen reference percentile across the distribution of marker-related cell measurement in each image. We apply this approach to quantify spatial patterns of distribution of the phosphorylated form of the N-Myc downregulated gene 1 (NDRG1), a novel DNA repair protein that conveys signals from the ECM to the nucleus to maintain replication fork homeostasis, and a known cell proliferation marker Ki67 in fibronectin-defined stromal regions in PDAC xenografts.

Here, we present RECUR, a method for identifying recurrent amino acid substitutions from multiple sequence alignments that is fast, easy to use, and scalable to thousands of sequences. We demonstrate the utility and performance characteristics of RECUR on a data set of surface glycoprotein (S) protein sequences from SARS-CoV-2 - identifying widespread recurrent evolution throughout the protein. Structural analysis of the recurrently evolving sites revealed significant enrichment in the exposed receptor-binding S1 subunit and at the interface with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), whereas recurrent substitutions were depleted at the trimeric interface of the S protein. Finally, in silico modelling showed that recurrent substitutions have primarily acted to stabilise the trimeric interface, but had no consistent effect at the hACE2 interface, suggesting that evolution at these sites has been shaped by opposing selection pressures - balancing the need to maintain or enhance hACE2 binding with pressures to diversify and evade host immune responses.

This work aimed to pinpoint distinctive anoikis-related genes (ARGs) in DN and delve into their impact on the immune landscape. Three datasets (GSE30528, GSE47184, and GSE96804) were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) dataset. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the ""limma"" package, while ARGs were obtained from GSEA, GeneCard, and Harmonizome datasets. The intersection of DEGs and ARGs was analyzed for Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. The CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to estimate the infiltration percentage of 22 immune cell types in DN renal tissue. Subsequently, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and random forest (RF) algorithms were adopted to screen key ARGs related to DN. After that, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of each gene and the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was adopted to quantitatively detect the expression of biomarkers in DN cell models. Finally, correlations between key genes and immune cell infiltration were analyzed, and a competitive endogenous ribonucleic acid (RNA) (ceRNA) network based on key genes was constructed. A total of 59 DEARGs were identified. GO functional annotation enrichment analysis revealed their involvement in kidney development, extracellular matrix (ECM), cytoplasmic vesicle cavity, immunoinflammatory response, and cytokine effect. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that MAPK, PI3K -Akt, IL -17, TNF, and HIF- 1 signaling pathways are critical for DN. In addition, seven key genes, including PDK4, S100A8, HTRA1, CHI3L1, WT1, CDKN1B, and EGF, were screened by machine learning algorithm. Most of these genes exhibited low expression in renal tissue of DN patients and positive correlation with neutrophils, and their expressions were verified in an external dataset cell model. The ceRNA analysis suggested potential regulatory pathways (H19/miR-15b-5p/PDK4 and KCNQ1T1/miR-1207-3p/WT1) influencing early DN progression.

Among other attributes, it is distinctive because it undergoes sex reversal from ZZ genotypic males to phenotypic females at high incubation temperatures. Here, we report an annotated telomere to telomere phased assembly of the genome of a female ZW central bearded dragon. Results: Genome assembly length is 1.75 Gbp with a scaffold N50 of 266.2 Mbp, N90 of 28.1 Mbp, 26 gaps and 42.2% GC content. Most (99.6%) of the reference assembly is scaffolded into 6 macrochromosomes and 10 microchromosomes, including the Z and W microchromosomes, corresponding to the karyotype. The genome assembly exceeds standard recommended by the Earth Biogenome Project (6CQ40): 0.003% collapsed sequence, 0.03% false expansions, 99.8% k-mer completeness, 97.9% complete single copy BUSCO genes and an average of 93.5% of transcriptome data mappable back to the genome assembly. The mitochondrial genome (16,731 bp) and the model rDNA repeat unit (length 9.5 Kbp) were assembled. Male vertebrate sex genes Amh and Amhr2 were discovered as copies in the small non-recombining region of the Z chromosome, absent from the W chromosome. This, coupled with the prior discovery of differential Z and W transcriptional isoform composition arising from pseudoautosomal sex gene Nr5a1, suggests that complex interactions between these genes, their autosomal copies and their resultant transcription factors and intermediaries, determines sex in the bearded dragon.

However, significant challenges remain for large-scale cultivated meat commercialization, including effective scaling, cost efficiency, and product quality, but also scientific evidence to support regulatory approval and building consumer trust. In this paper, we discuss the potential of an integrative multi-omics approach to characterize and optimize cultivated meat production. By analyzing a network-based interactome model that integrates the transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic layers, we achieve a system-level understanding of cellular metabolism and regulatory mechanisms. This approach can allow for precise monitoring and targeted interventions of critical quality and safety attributes associated with cellular biomass. We then describe a Target-Action-Metabolite (TAM) framework, which utilizes insights from the interactome to optimize cell culture conditions through actionable interventions. We illustrate the potential use of this framework through a case study involving Duck Embryonic Stem Cells (dESCs) for use in cell-cultured meat products, providing hypotheses for improving key metabolic pathways through targeted interventions on metabolites present in culture media. Finally, our paper highlights the potential of this interactome-based strategy to enhance bioprocess efficiency, improve product quality and ensure safety attributes, addressing regulatory challenges associated with cultivated meat production.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651459v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics"
2025-05-03 14:43,Evaluation of epistasis detection methods for quantitative phenotypes,"Listopad, S., Peng, Q., Renjith, G.",bioRxiv,2025-05-01,,"Background Epistasis, or genetic interaction, has been increasingly recognized for its ubiquity and for its role in susceptibility to common human diseases, such as Alzheimers. A wide variety of epistasis detection tools are currently available with several studies comparing the performance of methods suitable for case-control data. However, there is limited understanding of how well these tools perform with quantitative phenotypes. Methods We identified six epistasis detection methods suitable for quantitative phenotype data: EpiSNP, Matrix Epistasis, MIDESP, PLINK Epistasis, QMDR, and REMMA. To evaluate these tools, we generated simulated datasets using EpiGEN. The datasets modeled various pairwise interactions between disease-associated SNPs, including dominant, multiplicative, recessive, and XOR interactions. Additionally, we assessed the BOOST and MDR algorithms on discretized (case-control) version of the datasets. These tools were then tested on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset for the externalizing behavior phenotype. Results Each tool exhibited strong performance for certain interaction types, but weaker performance for others. MDR achieved the highest overall detection rate of 60%, while EpiSNP had the lowest overall detection rate of 7%. MDR and MIDESP performed best at detecting multiplicative interactions with detection rates of 54% and 41% respectively. Both MDR and MIDESP were also effective at detecting XOR interactions with detection rates of 84% and 50% respectively. PLINK Epistasis, Matrix Epistasis, and REMMA excelled at detecting dominant interactions, all achieving a 100% detection rate. On the other hand, EpiSNP was particularly effective at detecting recessive interactions with a detection rate of 66%. When analyzing the ABCD dataset, Plink Epistasis and Plink BOOST identified SNPs within the DRD2 and DRD4 genes, which have been previously linked to externalizing behavior. Conclusion Since no single method consistently outperforms others across all types of epistasis, and given that the specific types of epistasis present in a dataset are often unknown, it may be more effective to use multiple epistasis detection algorithms in combination to obtain comprehensive results.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651312v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics"

The performance of deep learning models depends on the information available for training. A growing trend in deep learning applications involves leveraging multi-omics data spanning genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other domains. When a deep learning model trained on omics data achieves high performance, the important question is to define factors that contribute to model predictive power. Explainable AI (XAI) methods can be categorized as model-aware and model-agnostic. Model-agnostic approaches, which rely on combinatorial feature perturbations to assess impact, are often computationally prohibitive for deep learning models. To address this, we developed OmiXAI, a pipeline integrating ensemble model-aware XAI methods. Our framework incorporates gradient-based techniques including Integrated Gradients, InputXGradients, Guided Backpropagation, and Deconvolution (for CNNs and GNNs) as well as Saliency Maps and GNNExplainer (specifically for GNNs).

However, cultivation of fruit-bearing crops such as tomatoes remains limited due to their high light demands, long growth periods, and tall plant structure. In this study, we aimed to develop an efficient cultivation system for tomatoes in a multilayer plant factory. Mini-tomatoes were hydroponically cultivated using white LEDs in a five-tier shelf system under two different cultivation methods. The conventional I-shaped method involved vertical growth on the top tier with downward lighting, while the novel S-shaped method trained each plant horizontally across the 2nd to 4th tiers with lateral lighting on each level. The S-shaped method enabled even light distribution, resulting in consistent photosynthetic rates throughout the canopy. In contrast, the I-shaped method suffered from strong light attenuation in the lower tiers, leading to reduced photosynthetic efficiency in shaded parts. Although total yield did not differ significantly between the two methods, the S-shaped method promoted earlier fruit maturation and improved fruit quality, including higher sugar content. Compared with greenhouse cultivation, plant factory conditions ensured stable temperature and lighting, leading to compact plant morphology, shorter internodes, and higher SPAD values. Moreover, fruit quality was more consistent year-round, with higher lycopene and sugar contents. This study demonstrates that the S-shaped cultivation system offers significant advantages in light use efficiency, plant management, and fruit quality. It represents a scalable approach for enhancing tomato production in plant factories and may facilitate the introduction of other high-light-demanding fruit crops into vertical farming systems.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.02.651818v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, genomics, plant biology"

Consensus indicates that CH4 emissions are stimulated by heat and UV, while CO release is additionally stimulated by visible light. The mechanisms producing these emissions are yet to be discovered. To get closer to finding these mechanisms, this study examined whether photosynthesis might influence CO and CH4 leaf emissions. Five plant species of different photosynthesis pathways were analysed for their photosynthesis performance, as well as CO and CH4 emissions under different temperatures and visible light intensities. Findings reveal CO release rates to be positively correlated with light intensity and temperature but suggest a separate dark metabolism. CH4 rates were independent of light intensity and temperature. Much lower CH4 release from excised leaves compared to their connected counterparts, indicates that such is dependent on stomatal opening, supporting the hypothesis that CH4 is dissolved in transpired water. CO release rates are similar between attached and detached leaves, suggesting that CO is produced at epidermal level.

We examined the possible effects of zeatin concentration in the plant regeneration medium, explant source, and species. Plants were grown to maturity under greenhouse conditions, pollen was collected and germinated. Flow cytometry analysis verified the utility of the pollen germination method for determining differences in ploidy, which was based on the number of pollen tubes produced with one tube representing diploid and two indicating polyploid. As for zeatin concentration, we assessed the effect of our standard method of initiation on medium containing 2 mg/l followed by 1 mg/l 2 weeks after culture initiation in comparison with 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/l throughout the culture lifetime. There were no major correlations for zeatin concentration on ploidy status across the species except for plants regenerated from S. lycopersicum hypocotyl explants where the percentage of polyploid regenerants increased with increasing concentrations. As for species and explant effects, P. grisea plants regenerated from hypocotyl explants had the highest percentage of polyploid plants at 81% compared to 43% and 35% for S. lycopersicum and S. prinophyllum, respectively. From cotyledons, 8% of S. lycopersicum and 20% of S. prinophyllum were polyploid. A comparison with P. grisea could not be made because cotyledon explants do not regenerate on zeatin-containing medium. The results indicated the incidence of polyploidization cannot be generalized for zeatin concentration, however, an influence of explant type and species was observed.

In this study, we successfully cultivated edamame using three hydroponic systems--nutrient film technique (NFT), rockwool, and aeroponics (mist culture)--within an LED plant factory. Among these, NFT demonstrated the highest fresh seed yield, which was comparable to or exceeded that of conventional field cultivation. The high yield was attributed to enhanced pod formation and biomass production under controlled conditions. Furthermore, although free amino acid content was lower in NFT cultivation, NFT-grown edamame exhibited significantly higher total sugar and isoflavone contents than field-grown counterparts, suggesting superior eating quality and nutritional benefits.

A potential strategy involves overexpressing a cyanobacterial dual-function FBP/SBPase, which catalyzes both reactionsOverexpression of this enzyme in tobacco plants or in other plants led to an increase in growth rate and biomass accumulation. Here, the overexpression of the same enzyme was achieved in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The recombinant cyanobacterial FBP/SBPase isolated from C. reinhardtii exhibited the expected catalytic activity, being Mg2+ dependent and strongly activated in the presence of a reducing agent. The FBP/SBPase expressing lines exhibited an increased photosynthetic activity at the cell level and decreased production of singlet oxygen upon exposure to high irradiances, suggesting improved capacity to manage high excitation pressure of the photosynthetic apparatus. Increased cell volume was measured in FBP/SBPase-expressing lines under different growth conditions. However, increased growth and biomass productivity were observed only in mixotrophy when light and CO2 were limiting, leading to increased starch, protein, and lipid content on a cellular basis. This phenotype caused an increased sedimentation rate in the transformant lines: the expression of FBP/SBPase enzyme could thus be considered as a strategy to improve the cell harvesting process.

Agaves, in particular, hold immense cultural and economic significance in Mexico and play a crucial ecological role in wild plant communities. However, current agricultural practices have negatively impacted both wild populations of agave through overexploitation and habitat destruction, as well as cultivated plants by reducing available landraces and promoting the use of homogeneous plant material. Using genomic data (RADseq) and over 50,000 SNPs, we aimed to assess how local social and political decisions may have influenced genomic diversity and differentiation in intensively managed, clonally propagated Agave angustifolia (Espadin) in the state of Oaxaca, as well as in the cultivated A. angustifolia used to produce mezcal known as Bacanora in the state of Sonora and their wild counterparts from both regions. We found evidence suggesting that Espadin recently aroused through farmer selection of a clonal lineage with desirable mezcal production attributes (i.e., hybrid vigor), apparently from a cross between genetically distinct wild populations or by hybridization between wild and cultivated varieties. Espadin samples were represented by closely related heterozygous genotypes, with considerable genetic differentiation from wild plants. On the other hand, the genomic composition of cultivated Bacanora agave apparently was influenced by a recently lifted ban (in 1992) on its cultivation and distillation, which, along with the relatively lower popularity of this beverage, allowed cultivated Bacanora agave to maintain the genetic diversity found in wild populations of the regions.

We thereby recode 105 codons to create an organism with a 57-codon genetic code; this organism - which we name Syn57 - uses 55 codons to encode the 20 canonical amino acids.,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.02.651837v1?rss=1,"bioinformatics, synthetic biology"
