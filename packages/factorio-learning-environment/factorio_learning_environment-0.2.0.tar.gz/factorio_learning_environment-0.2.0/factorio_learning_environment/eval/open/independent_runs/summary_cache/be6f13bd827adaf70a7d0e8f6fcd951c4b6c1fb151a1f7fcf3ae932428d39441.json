{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) to another Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items from the Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -77.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore, with a warning that the chest at drop position is full.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items from the Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items from the Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain to resolve waiting issues.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty chests to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full storage. Implement a more efficient logistics system to manage inventory overflow.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials to maintain continuous production. Check the supply chain for any disruptions or inefficiencies.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current session.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Current inventory containing items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
