{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces have failed, resulting in no updates to the map's entities. The inventory remains unchanged, indicating no successful deployment of structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Finding Buildable Spots\n- Ensure to identify a viable buildable area for placing entities like Burner Mining Drills. If the current BuildingBox size is too large, consider using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes or adjusting the size to fit the available space.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before attempting to place a Burner Mining Drill or Stone Furnace, verify that the desired location is suitable and unoccupied. This will prevent errors related to placing entities at invalid locations.\n\n### Errors in Code Execution\n- When using variables in code, ensure that all variables are defined before use. For instance, the error \"NameError: name 'furnace' is not defined\" suggests that the variable 'furnace' was used without being initialized.\n\n### Errors in Moving to Positions\n- When moving to a new position, ensure that the indices used are integers. The error \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" indicates incorrect data type usage in the move_to function.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Repeated attempts to place entities at various positions have failed. Double-check the map's layout and ensure that the positions chosen for placing entities are accessible and suitable for the entities' requirements."}
