{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore with occasional full output inventory.\n- Wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) used for staged storage and input/output buffering of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, transferring iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt remains unresolved, causing mining drill output issues.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5), fueled intermittently, currently sometimes out of fuel causing downtime.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) generating power, connected to boiler by pipes.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5), forming part of the power network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered but unable to craft due to lack of iron plates in input inventory.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 77.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving items between chests and assembling machine.\n- Newly placed inserter at (19.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates from chest (19.5, 75.5) to assembler input chest.\n- Some failed attempts to place additional inserters near chests due to tile occupancy conflicts.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt causing mining drill stoppage\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked due to full furnace output belt.\n- To resolve, clear or extend the output belt and ensure downstream chests or belts have capacity to accept iron plates.\n- Consider adding additional storage or transport belts to prevent furnace output inventory from filling.\n\n### Inserter placement failures due to occupied tiles or existing entities\n- Multiple failed attempts to place small electric poles near steam engine and mining/smelting area due to existing poles or drills occupying tiles.\n- Failed attempts to place burner inserters near chests at (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 77.5) due to collisions or existing inserters.\n- Mitigate by checking tile occupancy before placement, increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or repositioning reference points.\n\n### Boiler fuel management causing downtime\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) occasionally runs out of fuel, causing steam engine to stop generating power.\n- Ensure continuous coal supply to boiler to maintain uninterrupted power generation.\n\n### Assembling machine input shortages preventing crafting\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) consistently reports missing iron plates despite iron plates present in nearby chests.\n- Input inventories remain empty, indicating inserters are not feeding materials properly.\n- Verify inserter placement and operation to ensure iron plates are moved into assembling machine input.\n- Adding or repositioning inserters feeding the assembler input chest may help.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are fueled and operational.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Output chest and assembling machine output inventories remain empty\n- Output chests at (25.5, 82.5) remain empty, indicating assembled items are not being produced or moved.\n- Ensure assembling machine receives input materials and output inserters are correctly positioned and operational.\n\nOverall, focus on resolving output blockage at furnace, ensuring continuous boiler fuel supply, and improving inserter placement and feeding logic for the assembling machine to enable production.\n\n"}
