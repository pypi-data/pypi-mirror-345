{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transportation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-54.5). The drill is connected to a series of transport belts.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the mining drill to the furnace, consisting of 4 belts from (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) and continuing to (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently facing a shortage of ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserters** positioned at:\n  - (x=-10.5, y=-48.5), picking up from (x=-9.5, y=-48.5) and dropping at (x=-11.5, y=-48.5).\n  - (x=-7.5, y=-49.5), picking up from (x=-6.5, y=-49.5) and dropping at (x=-8.5, y=-49.5).\n  - (x=-5.5, y=-49.5), picking up from (x=-6.5, y=-49.5) and dropping at (x=-4.5, y=-49.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5), serving as a storage point within the production line.\n\n### Additional Belt Groups\n- **BeltGroup** from (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5) and continuing to (x=-18.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-49.5).\n- **BeltGroup** from (x=-17.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-52.5) and continuing to (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5).\n- Additional belts from (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5) and from (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts Directly to Non-Compatible Entities\n- Ensure that belts are not directly connected to entities like `Prototype.WoodenChest` or `Prototype.StoneFurnace`. Use an inserter to facilitate the transfer between belts and these entities.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Resources\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that your inventory contains the necessary resources to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Consistent Low Iron Plate Production\n- Investigate the production line to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Ensure that all necessary resources are being supplied to the furnace and that the furnace is operating efficiently."}
