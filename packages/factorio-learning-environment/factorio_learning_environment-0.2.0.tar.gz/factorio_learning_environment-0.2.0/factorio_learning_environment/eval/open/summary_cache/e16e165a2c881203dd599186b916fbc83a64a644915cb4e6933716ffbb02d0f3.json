{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled and operational\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace, fueled\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine, fueled\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine, fueled but out of fuel at times\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, not receiving electricity and lacking iron plates\n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) providing electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters, part of the electric network but assembler remains unpowered\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by an electric pole network. The burner mining drill and furnace are fueled and working, but the assembling machine is not powered and missing resources, causing production halt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to assembling machine not receiving power\n- Despite electric poles being placed and connected, the assembling machine reports no power.\n- Verify electric pole connections and coverage; ensure poles are properly linked in the power network.\n- Check that the assembling machine is correctly connected to the power network and no power outages exist.\n- Inspect for any misplaced or missing poles that might break the power chain.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters and other entities when inventory is empty\n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into burner inserters and mining drills fail due to no coal in inventory.\n- Always verify coal availability in inventory before attempting to insert fuel into entities.\n- Implement inventory checks and conditional logic to avoid futile insertion attempts.\n- Harvest coal proactively and maintain a buffer stock to prevent fuel shortages.\n\n### Errors placing wooden chests due to lack of inventory items\n- Attempts to place wooden chests fail because none are available in inventory.\n- Track inventory counts of required items before placement attempts.\n- Craft or gather necessary items beforehand to ensure availability.\n- Consider crafting wooden chests in advance to avoid placement failures.\n\n### Errors related to inserters running out of fuel or waiting for source items\n- Inserters sometimes run out of fuel or wait for source items due to fuel shortages or blocked outputs.\n- Maintain sufficient fuel supply for burner inserters to keep them operational.\n- Ensure output chests or assemblers have capacity to accept items to avoid blocking inserters.\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels and replenish proactively.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs and missing sinks for mining drill outputs\n- Burner mining drill reports output blocked by item on the ground due to no sink entity accepting output.\n- Confirm that inserters or belts are correctly positioned to receive items from mining drills.\n- Verify that output positions are free and connected to downstream entities.\n\n### General tips to mitigate placement, fuel, and power errors\n- Before placing entities, confirm the target tile is free and inventory contains the required item.\n- Regularly check inventory levels of fuel (coal) and essential items (wooden chests).\n- Verify power network connectivity and ensure all electric entities receive power.\n- Use conditional checks to avoid inserting items when inventory is empty.\n- Maintain buffer stocks of fuel and storage containers to prevent operational stalls.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
