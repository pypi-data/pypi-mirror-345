{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the steam engine and boiler, with pipes at positions such as (21.5, -10.5), (20.5, -10.5), and others\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (24.5, -7.5), (24.5, -6.5), and others for power distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (19.5, 18.5) for copper ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) for producing copper cables\n- Inserter at Position (9.5, 5.5) that puts items into the assembling machine\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) to the assembling machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Wooden Chests at various positions such as (-3.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5), and others for storage\n- Inserters at positions such as (-3.5, 1.5), (7.5, 5.5) for moving items between entities\n- Pipe Groups for fluid transport, such as at Position (18.5, -3.5) for water transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal without having it in inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when using entities with missing resources\n- Check that all required resources are available before starting production processes. The assembling machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) cannot produce copper cables due to missing copper plates.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
