{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, with iron ore as input.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a chest at position (2.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) transferring items from the chest to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** starting at position (3.5, 0.5) and ending at position (5.5, 0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring items from the belt to another chest at position (7.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Copper Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, with copper ore as input.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring copper plates from the furnace to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron plates and copper plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (11.5, 0.5) waiting for source items to transfer to a chest at position (12.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a transport belt moving coal to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal, which is periodically cleared to prevent overflow.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- **Inserters Waiting for Source Items**: Ensure that the source entity (e.g., furnace or chest) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to maintain continuous operation.\n- **Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination**: Ensure that the destination entity (e.g., chest or belt) has enough space to accommodate incoming items. Regularly clear or manage the inventory to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- **Chests at Drop Positions Being Full**: Regularly clear out items from chests to prevent production halts. Consider expanding storage capacity or improving logistics to handle excess items efficiently.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- **Refueling Issues**: Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities like furnaces and mining drills are regularly refueled to maintain continuous operation. Set up automated refueling systems if possible to minimize manual intervention."}
