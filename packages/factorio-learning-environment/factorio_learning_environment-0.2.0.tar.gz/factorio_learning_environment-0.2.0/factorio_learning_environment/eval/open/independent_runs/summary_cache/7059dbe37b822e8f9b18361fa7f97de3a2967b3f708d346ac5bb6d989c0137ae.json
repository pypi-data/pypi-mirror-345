{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n\nThis facility is responsible for extracting iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into the stone furnace, which smelts the ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\nThis facility extracts copper ore and processes it into copper plates. The burner mining drill supplies copper ore to the stone furnace, which then smelts the ore into copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is free from other entities. Remove any existing entities before attempting to place a new one.\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory\n- Verify that the required items are present in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. This includes ensuring that there is enough copper ore, iron ore, or coal available for insertion.\n\n### NameError due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are correctly defined and initialized before use. Double-check the variable names and their definitions to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors when inserting items with no available inventory\n- Before inserting items into an entity, confirm that the inventory contains the necessary items to avoid insertion errors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Attempts to place an entity at a specified position. Ensure that the position is unoccupied and that the entity is available in the inventory.\n- `insert_item`: Inserts a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Verify that the item is available in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_furnace`: Intended to represent a stone furnace for copper processing. Ensure it is correctly initialized and placed.\n- `iron_furnace`: Intended to represent a stone furnace for iron processing. Ensure it is correctly initialized and placed.\n- `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill. Ensure it is correctly fueled and operational.\n- `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill. Ensure it is correctly fueled and operational."}
