The error indicates that the furnace's inventory is full.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect entity types\n- Make sure to pass an Entity or EntityGroup as the second argument when using functions that require an entity reference. Avoid passing a Position object instead.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Ensure you are extracting from the correct furnace and that it has items available for extraction. \n\n### Errors related to lab power\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source to avoid the NO_POWER status. Check the electricity supply to the lab.\n\n### General tips\n- Double-check the positions of entities before performing actions to avoid errors related to incorrect placements or interactions."}
