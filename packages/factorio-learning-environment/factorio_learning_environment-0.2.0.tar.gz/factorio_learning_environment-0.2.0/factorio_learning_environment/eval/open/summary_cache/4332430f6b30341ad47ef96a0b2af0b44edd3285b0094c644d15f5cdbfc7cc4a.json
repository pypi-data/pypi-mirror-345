{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, placed on an iron ore patch\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates from the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) to transfer iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest\n\nThis structure forms a compact iron plate production line where raw iron ore is mined, smelted, and the output is stored in a chest for further use.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing entities due to occupied tiles\n- When placing an inserter next to the furnace at (16.0, 73.0), placement failed because the wooden chest at (17.5, 73) occupied the target tile. To avoid this, increase spacing, change the direction of placement, or adjust the reference position.\n- When placing a second wooden chest next to the existing chest at (17.5, 73.5), placement failed because the burner inserter at (18.5, 73.5) occupied the target tile. Use increased spacing, different direction, or alternate reference positions to find free tiles.\n\n### Errors inserting items due to empty inventory\n- Attempts to insert iron ore and coal into entities failed because the agent\u2019s inventory was empty at those times. Ensure the inventory contains the required items before attempting insertion to prevent these errors.\n\n### Fuel management and entity status\n- The burner mining drill and stone furnace ran out of fuel, causing them to stop working. Regularly supply fuel (e.g., coal) to these entities to maintain continuous operation.\n- Inserter status showed waiting for source items or waiting for space in destination, indicating bottlenecks in input or output flow. Monitor inventories and adjust supply accordingly.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been declared by the agent yet."}
