{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to other structures\n\n### Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) conducting Automation research\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and wood are needed for crafting copper cables and small electric poles.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Variables\n- Double-check your code for any undefined variables or misspellings. For instance, ensure that variables like 'copper_cable_needed_for_poles' are correctly defined before use.\n\n### Connection Failures\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, ensure you have pipes and electric poles when connecting steam engines or labs.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Verify the existence of entities at specified positions before performing actions. Ensure that the entities you are trying to interact with, such as labs or furnaces, are present on the map.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Regularly check the status of your entities to ensure they are working as expected. For example, confirm that the steam engine is operational after setting up the power network.\n\n### Inventory Management for Refueling\n- Keep track of your coal inventory to ensure you have enough to refuel boilers and maintain power generation. Regularly mine coal to prevent shortages.\n\nBy addressing these errors and following the tips, you can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your operations in the game."}
