{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete/Not Working)\n- Boiler at position (-7.5, 23.0) facing up\n- Offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- System is not connected and non-functional\n- Connection points for boiler: (-9.5, 23.5), (-5.5, 23.5)\n- Steam output point at (-7.5, 21.0)\n\n### Manufacturing Area\n1. Basic Furnace Line\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel: 17\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel: 18\n- Furnace at (5.0, 0.0) without fuel\n- Furnace at (8.0, 0.0) with coal fuel: 8\n- Burner inserter at (3.5, 0.5) connecting furnaces\n\n2. Automation Science Pack Production\n- Wooden chest at (8.5, 1.5) containing iron plates, copper plates, and iron gear wheels\n- Inserter at (9.5, 1.5)\n- Assembling machine at (11.5, 1.5) for automation science pack\n- Inserter at (13.5, 1.5)\n- Output chest at (14.5, 1.5) containing automation science pack\n\n3. Secondary Furnace System\n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0) with coal fuel: 19\n- Inserter at (4.5, 2.5)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0) with coal fuel: 21\n\n4. Research Lab Network\n- Multiple labs connected to electricity group 40555 (currently unpowered)\n- Some labs contain automation science packs (56, 110, and 31 units respectively)\n\n5. Belt Transportation System\n- Multiple belt groups forming transportation network\n- Main belt line running from (7.5, 3.5) to (-4.5, 19.5)\n- Secondary belt lines at various positions for item movement\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity group (ID: 40555) with multiple poles\n- Currently not providing power (voltage: 0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Verify target location is clear before placing entities\n- Check for existing objects that might block placement\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities according to their tile dimensions\n\n### Power System Connection Issues\n- Connect all power system components (boiler, offshore pump, steam engine) before adding fuel\n- Ensure proper orientation and alignment of power components\n- Verify fluid connections between components are properly established\n\n### Resource Access Issues\n- Move closer to target entity before attempting to extract resources\n- Verify resource availability in source entity before extraction\n- Ensure proper inventory management when handling resources\n\n### Power Network Problems\n- Connect all electrical components to the power network\n- Verify power production is operational before connecting consumers\n- Ensure proper fuel supply for power generating equipment\n\n### Fluid System Issues\n- Connect fluid-carrying entities (pipes, pumps, boilers) properly\n- Verify fluid flow direction matches entity orientation\n- Check for proper fluid connections between components"}
