{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (16.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore (currently offline due to power issues)\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron plates (currently idle due to no input)\n- Power connection issues present\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Operation at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) extracting copper ore (status unknown)\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 73.0) smelting copper plates (currently idle due to no input)\n- **Burner inserter** at (-45.5, 71.5) transferring items (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (15.5, -0.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, -0.5) extracting coal (output blocked by full chest)\n- **Wooden chest** at (15.5, 1.5) full of coal (needs emptying)\n- Power connection issues present\n\n#### New Power Generation System at (-20.5, -3.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-20.5, -3.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Boiler** at (-17.0, -4.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED, warnings: out of fuel, no input liquid)\n- No operational steam engine currently connected\n- No functional pipe connections established\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent Placement Issues\n- Repeated water tile placement attempts (steam engines at (-4.5,-1.5), (-6.0,-5.0), (-6.5,-2.5), (-15.0,-5.0)). Always verify terrain is land before placement.\n- Multiple failed boiler placements on water (at (-10.0,-4.0)). Check terrain before placement attempts.\n\n#### Fluid System Configuration\n- Failed boiler-to-steam-engine connections due to improper alignment. Maintain 2-space horizontal gap between boiler and engine.\n- Underground pipe connection failures. Ensure straight pipe paths between connection points.\n\n#### Power System Priorities\n- Continued \"NO_POWER\" status at mining operations. Complete power generation setup before expanding mining.\n- \"NOT_CONNECTED\" status persists on offshore pumps. Verify pump output direction matches boiler input.\n\n#### Operational Improvements\n- \"Chest full\" warning at (15.5,1.5) still unresolved. Implement belt system to move coal.\n- Furnaces remain idle with \"NO_INGREDIENTS\". Prioritize fixing ore supply chains.\n\n#### Construction Strategy\n- Multiple duplicate offshore pump placements. Verify successful placement before attempting alternatives.\n- Declining steam engine inventory (now 1 remaining). Conserve critical components until successful placement."}
