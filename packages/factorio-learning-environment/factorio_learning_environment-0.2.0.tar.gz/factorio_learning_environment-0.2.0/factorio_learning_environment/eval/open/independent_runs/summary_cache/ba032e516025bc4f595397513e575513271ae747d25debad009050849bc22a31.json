{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo compound structures have been successfully placed during these steps. Repeated attempts were made to acquire and supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for research support, but crafting and placement failed because the Lab was not available in the inventory and key sub-ingredients were missing. Although references were made to furnaces\u2014such as an alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) used for additional iron plate smelting and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) employed in copper plate production\u2014these entities were only retrieved for processing and were not newly placed as agent\u2013created structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Argument Usage \u2013 Ensure that calls to functions like get_entities exactly match the expected signature. Remove unsupported keyword arguments (for example, avoid using 'radius' when the function does not accept it) and avoid passing more positional arguments than allowed.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures \u2013 Before attempting to place or craft a Lab (intended to receive Automation Science Packs), verify that the Lab is present in the inventory and that all required sub\u2013ingredients (such as iron\u2013gear\u2013wheel, electronic\u2013circuit, and copper\u2013cable) are available. Adjust production chains to produce sufficient quantities of these prerequisites.\n\n\u2022 Handling Null and Iteration Errors \u2013 When a function that is expected to return a list (such as get_entities) instead returns None, check the result and substitute an empty list if needed to avoid 'NoneType' iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Resource Management for Complex Crafts \u2013 Prior to crafting complex structures like a Lab, ensure that all intermediate production steps (smelting additional iron/copper plates and producing sub\u2013components) have been executed successfully. This helps avoid repeated crafting errors due to missing ingredients."}
