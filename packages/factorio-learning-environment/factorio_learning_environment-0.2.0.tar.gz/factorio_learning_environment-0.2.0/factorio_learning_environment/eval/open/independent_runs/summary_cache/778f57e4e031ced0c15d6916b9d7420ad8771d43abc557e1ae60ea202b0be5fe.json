{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (x=24.5, y=-7.5), (x=24.5, y=-6.5), and (x=22.5, y=-4.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt and furnace result is full\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=2.5) containing 11 iron plates\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) waiting for source items\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (x=-2.5, y=1.5), (x=-2.5, y=0.5), and (x=-2.5, y=2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. For example, attempting to insert coal into a boiler without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters without Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entity for the inserter has items to transfer. If the inserter is waiting for source items, check the connected entities to ensure they have the necessary items.\n\n### Errors when Refueling Structures\n- Always verify that you have sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel structures like boilers."}
