{"content": "It seems like the execution result is not being displayed, which might indicate an issue with the environment or how the output is being captured. Here are some steps and considerations to help troubleshoot and ensure the output is visible:\n\n1. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure that the environment is set up to display print statements. Sometimes, outputs may be redirected or suppressed due to configuration settings.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: Check if exceptions are being properly caught and printed. If there are any errors in the code, they might not be visible if the exception handling isn't set up correctly.\n\n3. **Entity Retrieval**: Verify that the `get_entities` function is correctly fetching the entities. If entities are not found, subsequent operations will not execute as expected.\n\n4. **Execution Context**: Make sure the code is executed in the correct context where the Factorio REPL environment is properly initialized and running.\n\n5. **Debugging Statements**: Add additional print statements to confirm that the code is reaching certain checkpoints. For example, print a message right after fetching entities to confirm they are being retrieved.\n\n6. **Output Capture**: If the environment supports it, check if there's a console or log where the output might be directed.\n\nHere's an enhanced version of the code with additional debugging:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Attempt to fetch all necessary entities\n    entities = {\n        \"Offshore Pump\": get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump}),\n        \"Boiler\": get_entities({Prototype.Boiler}),\n        \"Steam Engine\": get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine}),\n        \"Electric Pole\": get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole}),\n        \"Assembling Machine\": get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1}),\n    }\n\n    # Confirm presence of each entity\n    for name, entity_list in entities.items():\n        if not entity_list:\n            raise AssertionError(f\"{name} not found!\")\n        print(f\"{name} is present.\")\n\n    # Assign entities for further operations\n    offshore_pump = entities[\"Offshore Pump\"][0]\n    boiler = entities[\"Boiler\"][0]\n    steam_engine = entities[\"Steam Engine\"][0]\n    electric_pole = entities[\"Electric Pole\"][0]\n    assembling_machine = entities[\"Assembling Machine\"][0]\n\n    # Move to the boiler and check fuel level\n    move_to(boiler.position)\n    current_coal = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    print(f\"Boiler coal level before refuel: {current_coal}\")\n    if current_coal < 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, 10)\n        print(f\"Boiler refueled.
