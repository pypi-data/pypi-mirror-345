{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled with coal.\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) transferring iron ore from the burner mining drill to the stone furnace.\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels.\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine.\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels from the output inserter.\n- Small electric poles at positions (21.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 76.5) intended to supply power to the assembling machine and inserters.\n\nThis structure is designed to convert mined iron ore into iron gear wheels, with inserters moving items between entities and a chest collecting the final product.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to placing assembling machines not in inventory\n- Ensure the assembling machine type you want to place is available in your inventory before attempting placement.\n- Use the correct assembling machine prototype that matches your inventory (e.g., assembling-machine-2 vs assembling-machine-1).\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts directly from furnaces\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from furnace entities.\n- Always use inserters to extract items from furnaces before connecting belts to move those items.\n\n### Errors placing inserters next to entities due to collisions\n- When placing inserters next to other entities, ensure the target position is free of other entities like chests or other inserters.\n- Increase spacing, change direction, or adjust reference position to find a valid placement location.\n- Check for nearby entities that might block placement, including assembling machines or terrain like water.\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power\n- Verify that small electric poles are placed close enough and properly connected to the assembling machine.\n- Confirm that the electric poles themselves are connected to a power network.\n- Adding additional electric poles or repositioning them may be necessary to ensure power delivery.\n\n### General tips to avoid repeated placement errors\n- Before placing an entity, check the tile for occupancy or collisions.\n- Confirm inventory contains the required entity type.\n- When connecting belts or inserters, follow the correct input-output chain rules (e.g., inserters must extract from furnaces before belts can transport items).\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
