Rejected placements (e.g. at (-7.0, 25.0) and (-4.5, 26.0)) indicate footprint conflicts; pre-assess and clear the intended path before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Repositioning Challenges\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure the player is moved sufficiently close to the target area to meet maximum placement distance constraints. Errors indicating that the target position (-5.0, 24.5) is too far require early repositioning of the player.\n\u2003\u2013 Clear the target area of any interfering objects before attempting to place the steam engine. Repeated placement failures due to existing obstructions must be resolved by actively removing conflicting entities.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the steam engine is successfully picked up and present in the inventory before placement attempts to avoid \u201cNo steam_engine in inventory\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Nearest Buildable Area and Attribute Access\n\u2003\u2013 When using the nearest_buildable tool, reference the buildable area\u2019s .center property properly (as an attribute, not as a callable) to avoid TypeError issues.\n\n\u2022 Correct Pickup Syntax and Variable Consistency\n\u2003\u2013 When retrieving entities, pass only the required entity object without extra arguments so that syntax-related exceptions (e.g. \u201cIf the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None\u201d) are avoided.\n\u2003\u2013 Define and reference entity variables accurately (for example, avoiding undefined variables like \u2018new_engine\u2019) to ensure status checks and repositioning commands execute correctly."}
