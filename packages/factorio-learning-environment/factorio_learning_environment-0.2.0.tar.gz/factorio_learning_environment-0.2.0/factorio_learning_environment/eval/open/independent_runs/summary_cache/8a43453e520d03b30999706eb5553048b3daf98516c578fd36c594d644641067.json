{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5), currently not connected to power network and has warnings for no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0), currently full output but not connected to the offshore pump.\n- Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5), currently not connected and has a warning for no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0).\n- Burner mining drill at position(5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position(y1) to the assembling machine at position(z1).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to connection issues\n- Ensure that all pipes and connections are clear of obstructions before attempting to connect entities. This includes removing any obstructing pipes around the offshore pump and boiler.\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are within the correct distance and that there are no placement blockages.\n\n### Errors when using electricity\n- Make sure that all electrical entities, such as the steam engine and boiler, are connected to a power network. Check the status of nearby electricity poles and ensure they are functional.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities that may block placement."}
