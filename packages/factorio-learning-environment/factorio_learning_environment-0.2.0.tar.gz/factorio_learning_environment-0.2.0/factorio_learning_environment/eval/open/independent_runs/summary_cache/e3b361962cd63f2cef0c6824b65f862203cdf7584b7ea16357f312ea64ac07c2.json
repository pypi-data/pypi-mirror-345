{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) extracting copper ore, connected to a series of Transport Belts at positions (-25.5, -65.5), (-24.5, -65.5), and (-23.5, -65.5) for transporting resources.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing produced iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items from the Wooden Chest to the Stone Furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters\n- Ensure there is a clear and suitable position for placing inserters. Check for any existing objects that might obstruct placement and adjust the position accordingly.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
