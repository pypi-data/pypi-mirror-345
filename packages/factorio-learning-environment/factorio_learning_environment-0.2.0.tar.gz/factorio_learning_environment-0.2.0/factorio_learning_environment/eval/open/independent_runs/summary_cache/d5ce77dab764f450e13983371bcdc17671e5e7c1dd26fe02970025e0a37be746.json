{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 72.5) collecting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (16.5, 72.5) attempting to transfer ore (currently misconfigured)\n\n### Power Generation Plant at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-6.0, 1.5) heated by coal\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 4.5) generating electricity\n- Connected pipe network for water/steam transfer\n- Power network supplying electricity to mining operation\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at (19.0, 75.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (19.0, 75.0)\n- Output chest at (20.5, 75.5)\n- Multiple failed inserter attempts between mining and smelting operations\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Always place small electric poles before connecting electric devices\n- Ensure power poles are within connection range (9 tiles for small electric poles)\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for obstructions before placing entities (existing entities or water)\n- When placing inserters next to entities, ensure:\n  - Proper spacing between entities (minimum 0.5 tiles)\n  - Correct facing direction for pickup/drop positions\n  - No collisions with adjacent entities\n\n### Inserter Configuration Problems\n- Inserters must have:\n  - Pickup position exactly on source entity\n  - Drop position exactly on target entity\n  - Proper fuel when using burner inserters\n- For chest-to-furnace transfer:\n  - Place inserter between chest and furnace\n  - Set pickup to chest position\n  - Set drop to furnace input position\n\n### Transport Belt Misuse\n- Belts cannot connect directly to chests - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- When connecting belts to inserters, use the inserter's drop_position as source\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Ensure furnaces have:\n  - Fuel (coal)\n  - Input materials (via properly configured inserter)\n  - Clear output path (to chest or belt)\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Verify object attributes before accessing (e.g., furnace.drop_position doesn't exist)\n- Check inventory before attempting to insert items\n- When removing misconfigured entities, verify new placement before rebuilding"}
