{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) containing coal (310 units).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) which is currently working and has coal as fuel (50 units).\n- The burner mining drill has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5) where it deposits mined resources.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0)) which is currently not operating due to lack of ingredients and has a full fuel source.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting items from the wooden chest**\n  - Ensure that the quantity requested for extraction does not exceed the available amount in the wooden chest. For example, attempts to extract 5 units of coal failed because the chest did not have enough available.\n  \n- **Errors when picking up the wooden chest**\n  - Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to pick up the wooden chest. The inventory was full, causing the pickup operation to fail.\n\n- **Errors when inserting coal into the burner mining drill**\n  - Confirm that the burner mining drill is not full before inserting coal. The drill's drop position being full can prevent further mining operations.\n\n- **Errors related to the burner mining drill's status**\n  - Monitor the status of the burner mining drill and the wooden chest to ensure that they are not full or lacking resources, which can halt operations.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, wooden_chest, quantity)` - This function has failed multiple times due to insufficient items in the wooden chest.\n  - `pickup_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, Position(41.5, -80.5))` - This function has failed due to a full inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wooden_chest`: type `Entity`\n  - `coal`: type `int`\n  - `iron_plate`: type `int`\n  - `wood`: type `int`\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: type `Entity`\n  - `stone_furnace`: type `Entity`"}
