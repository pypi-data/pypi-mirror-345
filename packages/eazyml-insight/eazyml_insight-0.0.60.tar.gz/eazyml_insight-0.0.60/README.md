A collection of APIs from EazyML family to discover patterns, generate insights, or mine rules from your datasets. Each discovered pattern is expressed as a set of conditions on feature variables - each with a trust-score to reflect confidence in the insight, allowing you to analyze and apply these insights to your data. Ideal for pattern recognition, interpretable AI, and augmented intelligence workflows.

### Features
- **Pattern Mining**: Discover meaningful rules from the  datasets.
- **Insight Generation**: Generate high-value insights with associated trust scores.
- **Application of Rules**: Apply discovered patterns to datasets for further analysis.

Ideal for use cases like interpretability, training data analysis, and building solutions with augmented intelligence.

## Installation
To use the augmented intelligence, ensure you have Python installed on your system.
### User installation
The easiest way to install this package for augmented intelligence is using pip:
```bash
pip install -U eazyml-insight
```
### Dependencies
This package requires:
- werkzeug
- unidecode
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- pyyaml
- requests

## Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the APIs from this package.

#### Imports
```python
from eazyml_insight import ez_init, ez_insight, ez_validate
```

#### Initialize and Read Data
```
# Initialize the EazyML automl library.
_ = ez_init()

# Define training data (Replace with the correct data path).
train_data_path = "path_to_your_training_data.csv"
```

#### Fetch Insights
```
# Define the outcome (target variable)
outcome = "target"  # Replace with your target variable name

# Customize options for fetching insights
insight_options = {"data_source": "parquet"}

# Call the EazyML APIs to fetch the insights
insight_response = ez_insight(train_data_path, outcome, options=insight_options)

# insight_response is a dictionary object with following keys.
# print(insight_response.keys())
# dict_keys(['success', 'message', 'insights'])

# the insight_response object contains insights/patterns that you can explore to integrate in your augmented intelligence workflows.

```

#### Use Insights to Validate
```
# Define test data.
test_data_path = "path_to_your_test_data.csv"

# Define the insights (response from ez_insight)
insights = insight_response['insights']

# Choose the record_number for validation. The default value is 1 if no value is provided.
validate_options = {"record_number": [1, 2, 3]}

# Call the EazyML function to validate
validate_response = ez_validate(train_data_path, outcome, insights, test_data_path, options=validate_options)

# validate response is a dictionary object with following keys.
# print(validate_response.keys())
# dict_keys(['success', 'message', 'validations', 'validation_filter'])

# the validate_response object contains validation metrics on the insights provided by ez_insight, along with the filtered data from the test data for the given record number in the insights.

```
