{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe reinsertion of Copper Ore into the active furnace has yielded the following results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace currently retains **2 pieces of Copper Ore** and still shows **18 Iron Plates** as output.\n- The furnace is in a **\"WORKING\"** status, indicating that it is prepared for processing.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has not yet processed the Copper Ore into Copper Plates, as evidenced by the remaining Copper Ore count.\n- The furnace is operational, but it appears that it has not begun the smelting process for the Copper Ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Fuel Levels**: Ensure that the furnace has enough fuel to initiate the smelting process. Although it shows **7 pieces of coal**, it is essential to confirm that it can sustain operations.\n2. **Inspect for Warnings or Errors**: Review the furnace for any potential warnings or issues that might prevent it from processing the Copper Ore.\n3. **Consider Reinserting Copper Ore Again**: If the furnace is operational but not processing, I may need to extract and reinsert the Copper Ore once more.\n\nLet\u2019s first verify the fuel levels and check for any warnings or errors in the furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the inventory of the active furnace to see its current fuel status\nactive_furnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect fuel levels and other inputs.\nprint(f\"Active Furnace Inventory Status: {active_furnace_inventory}\")  # Confirm if the furnace is adequately fueled. \n\n# Check for any warnings or errors in the furnace\nfurnace_warnings = get_furnace_warnings(active_furnace)  # Retrieve any warnings or errors from the furnace\nprint(f\"Furnace Warnings: {furnace_warnings}\")  # Display any warnings that might indicate issues with processing. \n\n# If everything seems fine, we can consider re-inserting the Copper Ore again\nif not furnace_warnings:\n    # Attempt to extract all Copper Ore first to refresh the loading state\n    extract_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Remove Copper Ore from the furnace\n\n    # Now reinserting back the Copper Ore\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Attempt to load the Copper Ore again\n    \n    # Check the furnace inventory status after reinsertion\n    new_furnace_inventory_status = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Check the updated inventory of the furnace\n    print(f\"Updated Active Furnace Inventory Status after reinsertion: {new_furnace_inventory_status}\")  # Show the new status of the furnace post-reinsertion\nelse:\n    print(\"There are warnings preventing the furnace from processing.\")  # Alert to the warnings scenario.
