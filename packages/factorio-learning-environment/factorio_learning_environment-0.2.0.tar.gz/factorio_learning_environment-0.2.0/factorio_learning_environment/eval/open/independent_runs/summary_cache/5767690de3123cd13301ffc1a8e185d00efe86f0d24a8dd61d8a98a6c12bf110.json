{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Manufacturing Complex at (x=6.5 to x=12.5, y=11.5)\n- Input storage chest at (6.5, 11.5) containing iron plates and copper cable\n- Burner inserter at (7.5, 11.5) moving items from input chest to assembling machine\n- Assembling machine at (9.5, 11.5) producing electronic circuits\n- Burner inserter at (11.5, 11.5) moving finished products to output chest\n- Output storage chest at (12.5, 11.5) storing iron plates, copper plates and electronic circuits\n\n### Smelting Area at (x=0.0 to x=4.0, y=0.0 to y=4.0)\n- Furnace 1 at (0.0, 0.0) for smelting copper plates\n- Furnace 2 at (2.0, 0.0) for smelting copper plates\n- Furnace 3 at (4.0, 4.0) for smelting iron plates\n\n### Power Generation System at (x=-9.5 to x=-2.5, y=22.5 to y=26.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Pipe network connecting water from pump to boiler\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 24.5) converting water to steam\n- Steam pipe network from boiler to engine\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Electric pole network distributing power\n\n### Research Facility at (y=28.5 to y=31.5)\n- Lab for conducting research\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 30.5) feeding science packs to lab\n- Storage chest at (0.5, 31.5) containing automation and logistic science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Full Errors\n- Monitor inventory space before attempting to harvest resources\n- Regularly empty inventory into appropriate storage chests\n\n### Storage Chest Capacity Issues\n- The input chest (wooden-chest at 6.5, 11.5) is reaching capacity limits - consider upgrading to steel chest or adding more storage\n- The output chest (wooden-chest at 12.5, 11.5) is full - need to manage output storage better\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in inventory to ensure continuous operation of boiler and burner inserters\n- Implement better coal distribution system to prevent \"no coal to insert\" errors\n\n### Production Line Issues\n- Electronic circuit production is stalling due to missing iron plate ingredients - ensure steady supply of materials\n- Consider adding more inserters or balancing input ratios"}
