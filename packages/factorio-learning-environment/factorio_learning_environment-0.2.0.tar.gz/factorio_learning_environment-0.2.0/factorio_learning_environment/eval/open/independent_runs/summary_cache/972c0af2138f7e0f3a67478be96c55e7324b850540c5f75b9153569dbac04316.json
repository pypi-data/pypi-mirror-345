{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with warnings of being out of fuel and output blocked.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-51.5) and another at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storage.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-15.5, y=-53.5), waiting for source items.\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-52.5), waiting for source items.\n  - At position (x=-9.5, y=-48.5), waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace.\n\n### Belt System\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the mining area to the processing area, consisting of 5 belts from (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Placing Wooden Chest\n- Ensure there is an available and suitable position for placing the wooden chest. Check for any obstructions or occupied tiles before attempting to place the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Transportation Issues\n- Verify the connectivity and alignment of belts and inserters to ensure iron ore reaches the intended destination. Check for any blockages or misalignments in the belt system.\n\n### No Iron Ore Available for Furnace\n- Ensure the mining drill is operational and has fuel to extract iron ore. Check for any blockages in the output path from the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to refuel inserters and furnaces. Regularly check and replenish coal stocks to avoid interruptions in operations.\n\n### Inserter Fueling Errors\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory."}
