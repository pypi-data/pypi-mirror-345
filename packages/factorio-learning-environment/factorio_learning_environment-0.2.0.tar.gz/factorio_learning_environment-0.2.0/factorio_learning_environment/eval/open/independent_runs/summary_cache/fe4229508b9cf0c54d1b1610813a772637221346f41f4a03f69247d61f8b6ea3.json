{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (17.5, 20.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (1.5, 23.0) with a warning for being out of fuel\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **Pipe Network** connecting these entities:\n  - Pipes at positions (1.5, 21.5), (3.5, 21.5), (-9.5, 23.5), among others\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at positions (27.5, 26.5), (26.5, 17.5), (30.5, 17.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between the boiler and the steam engine. Verify that the pipe network is complete and properly aligned with connection points.\n\n### Errors Due to Boiler Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to maintain its operation. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to avoid interruptions in steam production.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Confirm that the pipe network is correctly configured and that there are no blockages preventing fluid flow to the steam engine. Check for any warnings or status indicators that might suggest connectivity issues.\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Fluid Output\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly positioned and connected to the pipe network. Ensure that the pump is operational and supplying the necessary fluid to the system."}
