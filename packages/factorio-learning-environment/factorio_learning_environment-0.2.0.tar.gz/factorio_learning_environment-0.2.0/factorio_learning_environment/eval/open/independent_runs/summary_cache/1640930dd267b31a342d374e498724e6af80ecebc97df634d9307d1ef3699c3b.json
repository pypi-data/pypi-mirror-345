{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at (0,0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) processing iron ore to plates\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0) processing iron ore to plates\nBoth furnaces are operational with coal fuel but currently lack iron ore input\n\n### Copper Smelting Setup at (4,4)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal fuel and have produced copper plates\n\n### Research Lab at (8.5, 8.5)\nA single lab loaded with automation science packs, currently not functioning due to lack of power\n\n### Power Generation Setup at (-7.5, 22.0)\nPartially constructed power generation system consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-7.5, 22.0) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at (-7.5, 19.5)\n- Pipe network connecting offshore pump to boiler\nSystem is not fully functional due to incomplete connections between components\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- When connecting entities with pipes, ensure:\n  - Connection points are not blocked by other entities\n  - Entities are properly aligned and oriented\n  - There is a clear path between connection points\n  - You have enough pipes in inventory\n\n### Entity Placement Restrictions\n- Boilers cannot be placed on water tiles\n- Check for entity footprint overlaps before placement\n- Ensure there is enough clear space for larger entities like steam engines\n- Consider entity orientation when placing connected structures\n\n### Resource Management\n- Always check inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Ensure required raw materials are available before crafting items\n- Maintain adequate coal supply for boilers and furnaces\n\n### Power Infrastructure\n- Labs and other electrical entities require power to function\n- Ensure proper connection sequence: water pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine \u2192 electric poles\n\n### Entity Orientation\n- Pay attention to entity direction when placing connected structures\n- Some entities require specific orientations to connect properly\n\n### API Usage\n- Avoid using lists as direct arguments in get_entities calls\n- Verify entity existence before attempting interactions\n- Check if containers/furnaces contain items before extraction"}
