{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0)\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) waiting for source items\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n- Additional Stone Furnaces at positions:\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n  - (x=-9.0, y=-48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions:\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) waiting for source items\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items by checking the connected inventory and supply lines.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations.\n\n### Furnace Warnings: No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain production efficiency. Check the input lines and supply chests for necessary resources.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position if placement fails."}
