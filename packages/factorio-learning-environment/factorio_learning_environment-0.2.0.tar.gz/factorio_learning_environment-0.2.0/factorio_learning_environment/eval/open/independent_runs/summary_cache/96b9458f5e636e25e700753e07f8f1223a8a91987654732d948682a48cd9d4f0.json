{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-4.5, 22.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-4.5, 22.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 22.5)\n- Boilers at positions (-14.5, 20.0) and (-11.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boilers and steam engines\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnaces at positions (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), and (-13.5, -45.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Belt network connecting the furnaces and chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. Check the input supply lines and ensure they are not blocked or empty.\n\n### Inserter Blocked Output\n- Make sure the destination for the inserter's output is not full. Empty the destination chest if necessary to allow the inserter to continue working.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in boilers and ensure they are refueled in a timely manner to maintain continuous power generation.\n\n### Failed to Connect Entities Due to Placement Blockage\n- Before attempting to connect entities like pipes, ensure there is a clear path and no obstructions between the entities.\n\n### Failed to Connect Due to Missing Items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. Ensure you have enough pipes or other required items.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Ensure that the steam engines are properly connected to the power network and that there is a continuous supply of steam from the boilers. Check for any missing connections or obstructions in the pipe network."}
