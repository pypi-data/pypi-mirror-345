Check the surrounding area for obstructions.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that the entities you are attempting to connect (e.g., lab and boiler) are within the electric network range and are not obstructed by other structures.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
