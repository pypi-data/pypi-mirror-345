{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5) and is currently not connected to a power network. It has warnings indicating no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(42.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -82.0) which is currently fueled with coal.\n- A wooden chest (position 41.5, -83.5) from which coal was extracted.\n\n### Stone furnace at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) that is currently not smelting due to no ingredients available.\n\n### Belt group at position(40.5, -84.5)\nConsists of a belt group with inputs and outputs, facilitating the movement of items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to incorrect entity usage\n- Ensure to pass an Entity or EntityGroup as the second argument when using functions that require an entity reference. For example, in the error with `insert_item`, a Position was incorrectly used instead of an entity.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Ensure that there are items available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. The error regarding inserting coal into the Burner Mining Drill indicates that there was no coal available at the time of the operation.\n\n### Errors when entities are not connected\n- Check that all required connections are established for entities that depend on each other, such as the steam engine needing to be connected to a power network and having the necessary input fluids.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a specific tile before attempting to place it. This includes checking if the tile is occupied by another entity."}
