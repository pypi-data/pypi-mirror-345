{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: Position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (15 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (42 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities like Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters is not occupied by another entity or obstructed. Check for available space before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- When attempting to connect entities using belts, ensure that the correct intermediary entities like inserters are used when necessary. Belts cannot be directly connected to certain objects like Wooden Chests without an inserter.\n\n### Errors with extraction\n- Verify that the target entity for extraction contains the required resources before attempting to extract. Ensure the correct position and entity type are specified.\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from machines like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage."}
