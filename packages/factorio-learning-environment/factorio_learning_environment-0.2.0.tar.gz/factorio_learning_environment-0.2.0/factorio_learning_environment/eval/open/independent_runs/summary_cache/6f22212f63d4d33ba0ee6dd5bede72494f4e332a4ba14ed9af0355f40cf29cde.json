{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Connected by pipes forming a water and steam system\n- Small electric pole (position x=0.5, y=8.5) connected to steam engine\n\nThe power generation system is operational when properly fueled with coal, generating electricity with a throughput of approximately 190-450 water/steam units per minute. The boiler periodically runs out of fuel and needs to be refilled with coal.\n\n### Stone Mining Operation at position (-64.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-64.5, y=12.5)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-64.5, y=14.5) for collecting stone\n- Burner inserter (position x=-63.5, y=14.5) to extract stone from chest\n- Transport belt (position x=-62.5, y=14.5, direction=DOWN)\n\nThe mining operation is extracting stone at a rate of approximately 42-43 stone per minute. The chest periodically fills up with stone (capacity around 90-100 stone) and is being emptied by the agent who regularly extracts stone to feed the furnaces.\n\n### Stone Furnace Array at position (-41.0, 21.0)\nConsists of four stone furnaces in a row:\n- Stone furnace 1 (position x=-41.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace 2 (position x=-36.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace 3 (position x=-31.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace 4 (position x=-26.0, y=21.0)\n\nEach furnace has:\n- Coal fuel\n- Input inserters to receive stone\n- Output inserters to extract stone bricks\n- Collection chests for the output\n\nThe furnace array is smelting stone into stone bricks. Each furnace has been properly fueled with coal and the agent regularly adds stone to the furnaces and collects the produced stone bricks.\n\n### Stone Brick Collection System\nConsists of:\n- Collection chests at each furnace:\n  - Chest at x=-37.5, y=21.5 for furnace 1\n  - Chest at x=-32.5, y=21.5 for furnace 2\n  - Chest at x=-27.5, y=21.5 for furnace 3\n  - Chest at x=-22.5, y=21.5 for furnace 4\n- Inserters to move bricks from furnaces to chests:\n  - Inserter at x=-39.5, y=21.5 for furnace 1\n  - Inserter at x=-34.5, y=21.5 for furnace 2\n  - Inserter at x=-29.5, y=21.5 for furnace 3\n  - Inserter at x=-24.5, y=21.5 for furnace 4\n- Secondary inserters to move bricks from chests:\n  - Inserter at x=-38.5, y=21.5 for chest 1\n  - Inserter at x=-33.5, y=21.5 for chest 2\n  - Inserter at x=-28.5, y=21.5 for chest 3\n  - Inserter at x=-23.5, y=21.5 for chest 4\n- Main collection chest at x=-21.5, y=21.5\n- Inserter at x=-21.5, y=22.5 to extract from main collection chest\n- Transport belt at x=-20.5, y=21.5 for output\n\nThe system is designed to collect stone bricks from all furnaces. The agent has been manually extracting stone bricks from the furnaces and has started building a belt system to automate the collection, with stone bricks being placed on the transport belt.\n\n### Stone Wall Assembly System at position (-6.5, 27.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 ("}
