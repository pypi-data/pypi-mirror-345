{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working and dropping mined iron ore into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) which is storing mined iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Additional **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) which are not currently smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Storage Area\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) serving as additional storage, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5) is full. To continue mining, ensure to regularly empty the chest to avoid overflow and halt in mining operations.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- The stone furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) have warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that these furnaces are supplied with the necessary resources to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Furnace Fuel Source Full Warning\n- The stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) has a warning indicating that its fuel source is full. Regularly check and manage the fuel inventory to ensure efficient operation and avoid wastage.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions or important variables have been defined or invoked in the provided logs."}
