Remove any existing entity at the target position before placing a new one.\n\n### Inventory Full Errors\n- Before inserting items into an entity, check if the entity's inventory has enough space to accommodate the items.\n\n### Errors when accessing undefined entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access or manipulate is defined and exists in the specified location. Double-check entity names and positions.\n\n### NameError: 'Lab' is not defined\n- Ensure that the entity type 'Lab' is correctly referenced in the code. Verify the spelling and case sensitivity of the entity name."}
