{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n\nThis structure is designed to extract iron ore and smelt it into iron plates. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore and places it into the stone furnace, which then processes the ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is unoccupied and valid before attempting to place them. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot place [Entity] at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Verify that the new location for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is valid and unoccupied to avoid errors like \"Cannot move the Stone Furnace to the new location.\"\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure the presence of the entity type at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will help avoid errors like \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.5 y=-52.5.\"\n\n### Errors related to insufficient ingredients in furnaces\n- Regularly check and ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt.\""}
