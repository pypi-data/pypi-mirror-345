Warnings: [\u201cno input liquid\u201d, \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d]. Connection points: (-5.5, 22.5) and (-5.5, 26.5); steam output point: (-7.5, 24.5).\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) for water extraction with connection point at (-9.5, 23.5).\n- Pipe network elements:\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=733) at position(-2.5, 20.5) with pipes at [(-2.5, 20.5), (-3.5, 20.5), (-3.5, 21.5), (-1.5, 20.5)] (status: EMPTY).\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=734) at position(-8.5, 22.5) with pipes at [(-8.5, 22.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 22.5)] (status: FULL_OUTPUT, fluid: water).\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=736) at position(-7.5, 25.5) with pipes at [(-7.5, 25.5), (-7.5, 24.5)] (status: EMPTY).\n- Steam engine (Generator) at position(-1.5, 26.5) intended for electricity generation; warnings: [\u201cnot connected to power network\u201d, \u201cno input liquid\u201d, \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d]. Connection points: left at (-4.0, 26.5) and right at (1.0, 26.5).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Steam Engine Placement:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that chosen placement coordinates are free of water and obstructions. Attempts at (-5.0, 27.0) and (-4.5, 25.5) were rejected due to footprint collisions.\n\u2003\u2013 When using the nearest_buildable tool, ensure that the resulting buildable area aligns well with the intended placement zone.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Connection Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that fluid source and target endpoints match the required configurations. Errors such as \u201cFluids currently at source Prototype.Pipe \u2026 not needed and expected by the target\u201d indicate misalignment in connection parameters.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that connection points for the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump are unblocked and compatible before initiating pipe connections.\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid reversing source and target parameters unless their validity has been verified.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Always verify that the boiler has sufficient fuel before operation. Harvesting and inserting coal resolved the initial \u201cboiler out of fuel\u201d issue; maintain an adequate fuel supply in inventory.\n\n\u2022 Network Stabilization:\n\u2003\u2013 Allow proper waiting periods (10\u201320 seconds) for the fluid network to stabilize and for steam propagation before reattempting placements or connections."}
