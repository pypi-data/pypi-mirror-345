For automation science packs, you need copper plates and iron gear wheels, which in turn require iron plates. Make sure to set up furnaces to smelt these materials before crafting.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
