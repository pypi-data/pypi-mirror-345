{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (Position: 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Coal Supply System at position (42, -81)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (Position: 42.5, -81.5) containing coal\n- Burner Inserter (Position: 42.5, -80.5) waiting for source items\n- Burner Inserter (Position: 43.5, -81.5) waiting for space in destination\n- Burner Mining Drill (Position: 42.0, -83.0) with no fuel\n\n### Iron Plate Mining at position (-15, -50)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (Position: -15.0, -50.0) with no fuel\n- Wooden Chest (Position: -14.5, -48.5) with no items\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting coal from the Wooden Chest**\n  - Ensure that the Wooden Chest has sufficient coal before attempting to extract. Currently, the system reports \"No Coal available in the Wooden Chest to extract.\"\n  \n- **Errors with Burner Mining Drill being out of fuel**\n  - Regularly check and supply fuel to the Burner Mining Drills to prevent them from becoming inactive. The logs indicate multiple instances of Burner Mining Drills reporting \"NO_FUEL.\"\n\n- **Errors with Inserters waiting for items**\n  - Ensure that the source entities (like Wooden Chests) have the required items before the inserters are activated. The logs show inserters waiting for source items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined:**\n  - No functions have been defined or invoked yet.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `stone_furnace_inventory`: dict\n  - `coal_inventory`: dict\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: list\n  - `burner_inserter_status`: list\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `current_inventory`: dict"}
