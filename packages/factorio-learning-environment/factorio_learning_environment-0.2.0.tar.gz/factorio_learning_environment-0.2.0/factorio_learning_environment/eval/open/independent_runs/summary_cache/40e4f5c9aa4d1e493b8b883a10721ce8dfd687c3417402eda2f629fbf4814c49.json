It remains at position (0.0, 0.0) and continues to serve as the central processing structure for converting ore into metal plates.\n\n### Lab with Power Connection at position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab positioned at (10.5, 0.5) intended for Automation Technology research. It remains without power.\n- Small Electric Pole placed at (10.5, -1.5) connected to the Lab for power distribution.\n\n### Power Generation System near water resource\nLocated around the water patch at approximately x=-9.0 y=25.0, this system is designed to generate power and supply the Lab. It consists of:\n- Offshore Pump placed at (\u20139.5, 24.5) to extract water.\n- Boiler positioned at (\u20133.5, 21.0) adjacent to the Offshore Pump for steam production.\n- SteamEngine positioned at (9.5, 18.5) intended to generate electricity.\nThe structures are interlinked via pipes and fuel supply mechanisms (coal inserted into the Boiler) to enable fluid and energy flow, although the fluid connection remains incomplete due to current issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Placement issues due to missing inventory items  \n  - Before placing an entity (e.g. Offshore Pump), verify that the required item is present in inventory.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting failures from insufficient sub-ingredients  \n  - Ensure that all sub-ingredient requirements (e.g. iron-gear-wheel and electronic-circuit for OffshorePump) are met by verifying resource availability and proper processing (smelting in furnaces or crafting with required machines) before attempting to craft.\n  \n\u2022 Furnace production timeouts  \n  - Monitor furnace output closely and extract products as soon as available to avoid timeout exceptions. Allow sufficient time for smelting cycles when expecting multiple outputs.\n  \n\u2022 Errors when inserting fuel  \n  - Confirm inventory contains the necessary fuel (e.g. coal) before inserting into the Boiler.\n  \n\u2022 Connection errors in fluid/piping networks  \n  - Ensure that inventory has the required connecting items (e.g. pipes) available prior to establishing connections between entities."}
