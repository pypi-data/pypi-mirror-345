{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Status: EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Fuel: {'coal': 7}\n  - Smelting: {}\n  - Furnace Result: {'iron-plate': 24}\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5)\n  - Fuel: {'coal': 4}\n  - Status: EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (0.5, 0.5)\n  - Drop Position: (2.5, 0.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (3.5, 0.5)\n  - Status: EntityStatus.NORMAL\n  - Inventory: {}\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free from other entities before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or altering the reference position to avoid collisions. For example, attempting to place a burner inserter next to a furnace where a wooden chest already exists resulted in placement failure.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or insert them into entities. For instance, attempting to insert iron ore into the furnace without having any in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities incorrectly\n- Understand the correct method to connect entities. For example, belts cannot be directly connected to a wooden chest; use an inserter to transfer items into the chest instead.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
