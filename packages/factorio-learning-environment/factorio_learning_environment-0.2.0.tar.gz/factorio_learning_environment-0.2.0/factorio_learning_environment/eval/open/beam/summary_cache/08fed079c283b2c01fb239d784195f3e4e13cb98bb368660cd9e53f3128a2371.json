This suggests that the reference to `Prototype.IronOre` was incorrect or that the inventory check did not account for the available resources properly.\n\n### Current Inventory Recap:\n- **5 pieces of stone furnaces**\n- **5 pieces of stone**\n- **20 pieces of copper ore**\n- **8 pieces of iron plates**\n- **6 pieces of copper plates**\n- **20 pieces of copper cables**\n- **13 pieces of Iron Gear Wheels**\n\n### Furnace Status:\n- The existing furnace is still empty and has **3 pieces of coal** remaining as fuel.\n\n### Immediate Steps to Resolve:\n1. **Verify Available Resources**: I need to confirm the exact resources available in my inventory to ensure I am referencing them correctly.\n2. **Use the Correct Resource Reference**: If I have iron ore available, I need to use the correct identifier to insert it into the furnace.\n\nLet\u2019s check the inventory again to confirm the available resources and ensure that I can proceed with smelting.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the overall inventory to confirm available resources\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory: {current_inventory}\")  # Review current overall inventory\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states.", "summary_range": "[1-276]"}
