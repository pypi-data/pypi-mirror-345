{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0) connected to wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5)\n- Currently mining iron ore with 602 iron ore stored in chest\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0) connected to wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5)\n- Currently mining coal with 88 coal stored in chest\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Three wooden chests in sequence:\n  - Initial chest at (20.5, 21.5) with 5 copper ore\n  - Middle chest at (22.5, 21.5) with 397 copper ore\n  - Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) with 53 copper plates\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Three burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving ore between initial and middle chest\n  - Second inserter at (23.5, 21.5) moving ore from middle chest to furnace\n  - Third inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving processed plates from furnace to output chest\n\n### Unused Furnaces\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0) without active production\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Placement and Orientation Issues\n- Ensure inserters are properly oriented to pick up from source and drop to destination\n- Check that inserter drop and pickup positions align with connected entities\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning - ensure proper item flow through inserters\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Resource Flow Optimization\n- Large amount of copper ore (397) accumulated in middle chest suggests possible bottleneck in processing line\n- Consider balancing mining speed with processing capacity"}
