{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (534 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner Mining Drill at (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Reposition and align inserters to ensure they can pick up and drop items effectively.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure that the furnace is receiving iron ore. Verify that the inserter is correctly positioned and has a clear path to transfer items to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Insertion Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities such as mining drills or inserters. Harvest coal if necessary to maintain a steady supply.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
