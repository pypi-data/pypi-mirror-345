{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore, but frequently full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) feeding the chests, fueled and operational.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to the power network.\n- Despite frequent extraction of iron plates from chests and furnace output, the furnace output inventory often empties but the mining drill still reports output belt blockage.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and storage with improved inserter fueling and power connectivity, though output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), fueled with coal and operational.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), connected to boiler by pipes, generating electricity.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5) forming an extended power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates steam power and supplies electricity to the factory.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power network, receiving iron plates directly inserted and via input chest at (21.5, 75.5).\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) with output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and working.\n- Assembling machine intermittently holds iron plates and iron gear wheels in input and output inventories but reports shortage of iron plates preventing continuous crafting.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and output inserters in place, currently limited by inconsistent iron plate supply and output clearing.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Continued failure to place small electric poles near stone furnace at (18.0, 75.0) due to collision with mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) and water tiles.\n- Attempts to place poles with fixed spacing and direction fail when tiles are occupied or unsuitable.\n- To avoid these errors, dynamically check tile occupancy and terrain before placement; consider varying spacing, direction, or reference points to find valid placement locations.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters occasionally wait for source items due to empty chests, indicating supply chain interruptions.\n- Maintain balanced input and output inventories and ensure continuous supply of fuel and source items to prevent inserter stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) intermittently holds iron plates and iron gear wheels but repeatedly reports missing iron plates preventing crafting.\n- Direct insertion of iron plates into assembler input chest and assembler itself occurs but output chests remain empty, indicating output handling issues.\n- Ensure steady and sufficient iron plate supply to assembler input and clear output chests regularly to avoid crafting interruptions.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" despite frequent extraction of iron plates from furnace and chests.\n- Stone furnace output inventory frequently full, blocking further smelting and mining drill output.\n- Power network extended with additional poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5) improving connectivity.\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items, and ensure"}
