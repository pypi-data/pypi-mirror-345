{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5). This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and depositing it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) which serves as additional storage capacity to prevent overflow.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which transfers items between the chests.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which processes the iron ore into iron plates. It is currently fueled by coal and has produced 10 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or empty entities\n- Ensure the target entity exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract. For example, verify that the wooden chest contains iron plates before extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied or adjust the spacing and direction to avoid collisions. For instance, when placing a wooden chest or burner inserter, ensure that the intended position is free from other entities.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient ingredients for processing\n- Regularly check the furnace's inventory to ensure it has the necessary ingredients for smelting. If the furnace shows a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt,\" replenish its input inventory with the required materials.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities with incorrect spacing or direction\n- When positioning entities like inserters or chests, consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction to accommodate existing structures and avoid placement errors."}
