{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, currently out of fuel\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) facing up, currently out of fuel and without ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates\n\nThis structure is intended to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and collect the output in the chest. The burner mining drill extracts iron ore, which is fed into the furnace. The furnace smelts the ore into plates, which are then moved by an inserter into the wooden chest for storage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing burner inserter next to furnace due to occupied tile\n- The burner inserter placement at position (18.5, 73.5) failed because the wooden chest at (17.5, 73) occupies the intended tile.\n- To avoid this, increase spacing when placing the inserter, change the direction of placement, or adjust the reference position to find a free adjacent tile.\n\n### Inserter placement and pickup/drop position errors\n- Multiple attempts to place a burner inserter to move iron plates from furnace to chest failed due to incorrect placement or occupied tiles.\n- Before placing inserters, verify that the target tile is free and that the inserter\u2019s pickup and drop positions align correctly with the furnace output and chest input.\n- Consider placing inserters with at least one tile spacing or changing orientation to avoid collisions.\n\n### Fuel insertion errors due to empty inventory\n- Attempts to insert iron ore or coal into entities failed when the inventory was empty.\n- Ensure sufficient resources are harvested and available in inventory before attempting to insert fuel or materials into drills, furnaces, or inserters.\n\n### Fuel and ingredient status warnings\n- The burner mining drill and stone furnace frequently report \"out of fuel\" and \"no ingredients to smelt\" statuses.\n- Regularly check and maintain fuel supply in drills, furnaces, and inserters to keep them operational.\n- Insert iron ore into the furnace to enable smelting.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined yet."}
