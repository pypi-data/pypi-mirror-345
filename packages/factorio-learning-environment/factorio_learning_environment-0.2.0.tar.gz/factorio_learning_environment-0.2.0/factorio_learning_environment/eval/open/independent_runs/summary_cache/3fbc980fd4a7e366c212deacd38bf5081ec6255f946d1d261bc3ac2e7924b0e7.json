{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -3.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid, while the boiler is out of fuel and not connected.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the offshore pump and boiler are within a feasible distance for pipe connection. The connection attempt from (-9.5, 24.5) to (-3.5, 25.0) failed, indicating that the entities may be too far apart or obstructed.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This may apply to the connection points of the boiler and offshore pump.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
