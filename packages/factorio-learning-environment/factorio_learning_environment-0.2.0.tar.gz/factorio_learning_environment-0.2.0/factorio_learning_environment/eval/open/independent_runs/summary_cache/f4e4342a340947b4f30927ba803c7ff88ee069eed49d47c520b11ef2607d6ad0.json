{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2022 Cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n\u2022 New factory burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) placed using direction RIGHT  \n\u2003\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Neighbours include a burner inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5) and an assembling machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5)\n\n### Belt Depot at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2022 Wooden chest serving as the belt depot at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) (crafted and successfully placed in Step 214)\n\u2022 Dedicated transport belt segment adjacent to the depot at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) (placed in Step 215)\n\u2022 Depot burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) placed using direction UP (providing a pickup at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5); placed in Step 216)\n\n### Extraction System at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2022 Extraction system burner inserter at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5) with its drop position at Position(x=-3.5, y=28.5)\n\u2022 Defined intermediate waypoints for belt routing at Position(x=0.0, y=26.0) and Position(x=1.0, y=22.0)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Target Error  \n  When connecting transport belts (observed in Steps 210, 211, 213, 214, 215, 216, and 217), the target is mistakenly interpreted as a Prototype.SteamEngine.  \n  \u2192 Tip: Ensure the target entity is not a steam engine by adding an inserter that feeds items into it, and then use that inserter as the connection endpoint.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range Error  \n  An error occurred when placing a wooden chest at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) because the player was too far away (as in Step 212).  \n  \u2192 Tip: Move sufficiently close (within the maximum placement distance of 10 units) to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Error  \n  An error (\u201cNameError: name 'target_chest' is not defined\u201d) was raised due to referencing an undefined variable (Step 212).  \n  \u2192 Tip: Verify that all variables are properly defined and that naming conventions are consistent before use.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage Error  \n  In Step 213, placing the wooden chest failed due to a missing inventory item.  \n  \u2192 Tip: Check and, if necessary, craft or collect the required items prior to placement attempts."}
