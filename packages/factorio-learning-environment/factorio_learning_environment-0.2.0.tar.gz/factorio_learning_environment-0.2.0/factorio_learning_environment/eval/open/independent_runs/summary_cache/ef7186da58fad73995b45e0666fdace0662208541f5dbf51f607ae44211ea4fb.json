{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-10.5, y=-49.5) serving as a target for iron ore transfer.\n- Repeated movement of iron ore from the chest at (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to the chest at (x=-10.5, y=-49.5).\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=54.5, y=-78.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-10.5, y=-49.5) serving as a target for coal transfer.\n- Repeated movement of coal from the chest at (x=54.5, y=-78.5) to the chest at (x=-10.5, y=-49.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) producing iron plates.\n- Inventory of the stone furnace indicates production of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Full Errors\n- Ensure that the target inventory has sufficient space before attempting to insert items. The repeated attempts to insert coal into the stone furnace at position (x=-14, y=-49) failed because the inventory was full (50/50 items). Consider removing items from the furnace or expanding storage capacity.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron ore in the chest at (x=-11.5, y=-49.5).\n- `target_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal and iron ore in the chest at (x=-10.5, y=-49.5).\n- `coal_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of coal in the chest at (x=54.5, y=-78.5).\n- `stone_furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of iron plates in the stone furnace at (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)."}
