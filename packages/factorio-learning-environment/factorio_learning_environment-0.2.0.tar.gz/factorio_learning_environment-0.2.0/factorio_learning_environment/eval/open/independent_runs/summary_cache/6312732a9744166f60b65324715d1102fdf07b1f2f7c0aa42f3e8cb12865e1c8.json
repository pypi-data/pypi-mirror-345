{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler, and from the boiler to the steam engine.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) connected to power network with poles\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) storing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5) for output\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=20870) with pipes connecting various positions including (-0.5, 16.5) to (1.5, 28.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=20872) with water, connecting positions (-9.5, 21.5) to (-7.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=20878) at position (-7.5, 24.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=95009) with poles at various positions including (11.5, 6.5) to (1.5, 25.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that there are no existing entities at the target position before placing pipes or underground pipes. Clear any existing entities before attempting to place new ones.\n- Verify that the terrain is suitable for placing pipes or underground pipes. Avoid placing them where the terrain is unplaceable, such as water.\n\n### Boiler Connection Issues\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to both the offshore pump and the steam engine. Check for any disconnected pipes or incorrect placements that might prevent the flow of water.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to a functioning power network. Verify that the electricity network is complete and that poles are properly connected to provide power to inserters.\n\n### Furnace Output Management\n- Regularly extract iron plates from the furnace to prevent output blockage. Ensure there is a consistent flow of input materials to keep the furnace operational."}
