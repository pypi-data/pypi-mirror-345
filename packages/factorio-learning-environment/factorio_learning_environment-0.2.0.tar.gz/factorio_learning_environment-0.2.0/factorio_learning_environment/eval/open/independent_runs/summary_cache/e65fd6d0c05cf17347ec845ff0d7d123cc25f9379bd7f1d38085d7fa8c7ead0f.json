{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not generating power due to being disconnected from the power network and lacking input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is currently not engaged in any research.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) which is not receiving electricity and cannot create automation-science-pack due to missing resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when steam engine is not generating power\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to a power network and has a source of water to operate.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- The second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup. Ensure you are passing the correct entity reference instead of a position when attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
