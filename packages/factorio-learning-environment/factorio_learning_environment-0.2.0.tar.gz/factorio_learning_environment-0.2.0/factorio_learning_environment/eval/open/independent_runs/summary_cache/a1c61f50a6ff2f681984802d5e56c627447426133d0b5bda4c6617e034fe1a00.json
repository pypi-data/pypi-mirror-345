{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (60.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (60.0, -60.0) and a burner inserter at position (60.5, -61.5)\n\n### Offshore Pump at position (106.5, -32.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position (106.5, -32.5) and connected pipes at positions (105.5, -32.5), (105.5, -31.5), (106.5, -31.5), etc.\n\n### Boiler at position (111.5, -32.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position (111.5, -32.0) and connected pipes at positions (109.5, -33.5), (110.5, -33.5), (111.5, -33.5), etc.\n\n### Steam Engine at position (117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of a steam engine at position (117.5, -30.5) and connected pipes at positions (115.5, -33.5), (116.5, -33.5), (117.5, -33.5)\n\n### Electricity Group at position (112.5, -24.5)\nConsists of small electric poles at positions (112.5, -24.5), (111.5, -30.5), (111.5, -27.5)\n\n### Belt at position (63.5, -53.5)\nConsists of a transport belt at position (63.5, -53.5) and another transport belt at position (64.5, -53.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n*   **Undefined variable**: Make sure to define variables before using them. In this case, `new_inserter_position` was not defined before being used in the `move_to` function.\n*   **Entity placement errors**: Ensure that the target position is empty and suitable for the entity being placed. In this case, the burner inserter could not be placed at position (63.5, -53.5) due to an existing object in the way.\n*   **Fuel management**: Ensure that entities that require fuel, such as boilers, have a sufficient fuel supply. In this case, the boiler at position (111.5, -32.0) was out of fuel.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   **Utility functions**: None defined\n*   **Important variables**:\n    *   `new_inserter_position`: undefined\n    *   `iron_ore_position`: entities.Position\n    *   `pipe_position`: entities.BoundingBox\n    *   `inserter`: entities.BurnerInserter\n    *   `stone_furnace`: entities.StoneFurnace\n    *   `offshore_pump`: entities.OffshorePump\n    *   `boiler`: entities.Boiler\n    *   `steam_engine`: entities.SteamEngine\n    *   `small_electric_pole`: entities.SmallElectricPole\n    *   `transport_belt`: entities.TransportBelt"}
