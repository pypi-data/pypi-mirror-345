{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore. It is fueled with coal and is operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore extracted by the mining drill. Currently contains 484 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is fueled with coal but is currently not transferring items due to setup issues.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not operational due to lack of iron ore input.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (chest) to the destination (furnace). Check the pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly set.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel (coal) in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters. Keep track of your coal inventory to avoid running out unexpectedly.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. If the furnace is not receiving items, check the inserter setup and ensure it is operational and correctly configured.\n\nBy addressing these issues, you can improve the efficiency and functionality of your current setup."}
