Consider adjusting the spacing or changing the reference position to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure that the target entity has the required items to extract. Verify the entity's inventory before attempting extraction to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to craft or place items. Regularly check your inventory levels to avoid crafting failures.\n\n### Inserter Errors\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked and that there is sufficient space for items to be moved. Check for warnings like \"output blocked\" and address them by clearing the destination or providing a valid sink entity."}
