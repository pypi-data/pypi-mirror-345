{"content": "# REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line 1 (at y=0.0)\nConsists of an automated smelting setup:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) connected to first furnace\n- Burner inserter at (2.5, 1.5) connected to second furnace\n- Wooden chest at (0.5, 2.5) collecting iron plates\n- Wooden chest at (2.5, 2.5) collecting iron plates\n\n### Iron/Copper Plate Production Line 2 (at y=4.0)\nConsists of an automated smelting setup now converted to handle copper:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n- Burner inserter at (4.5, 5.5) connected to first furnace\n- Burner inserter at (6.5, 5.5) connected to second furnace\n- Wooden chest at (4.5, 6.5) collecting plates\n- Wooden chest at (6.5, 6.5) collecting plates\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-5.5, y=20.0)\nSteam-based power generation setup:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0) heating water to steam\n- Steam engine at (-5.5, 19.5) generating electricity\n- Pipe network connecting water and steam flow\n- Small electric poles connecting power to lab\n\n### Research Facility (at y=10.5)\n- Lab at (0.5, 10.5) powered by electricity grid\n- Currently researching automation technology\n- Connected to power via electric poles at (-1.5,12.5), (-6.5,14.5), (-7.5,19.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory management errors\n- Check inventory before attempting to:\n  - Insert materials into furnaces (iron ore, copper ore)\n  - Place new entities (offshore pump, boiler)\n  - Craft items requiring raw resources\n\n### Raw resource gathering reminders\n- Wood cannot be crafted, must be gathered from trees\n- Copper plates and iron plates require smelting, cannot be crafted directly\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before placing structures\n- Verify space is available when placing new structures\n\n### Type errors in building calculations\n- Building dimensions should be accessed as properties not attributes\n- Example: Use Prototype.Boiler.width instead of Prototype.Boiler.WIDTH\n\n### Entity connection errors\n- Ensure required connection items (like pipes) are in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Verify entities are within connection range"}
