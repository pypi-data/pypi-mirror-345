{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20, -70)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\".\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt and a furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0).\n- Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) waiting for source items, connected to a furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) and a wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23, -68)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) working with copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) containing copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting various positions for ore movement.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14, -53)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a warning of \"out of fuel\".\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) containing iron ore.\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) containing coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) working with coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to wooden chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various positions for item transportation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Attribute Access on Non-Existent Attributes\n- Ensure the object you are trying to access attributes from is of the correct type and has the expected attributes. For example, a 'Chest' object does not have an 'outputs' attribute.\n\n### Errors with NoneType Objects\n- Before accessing attributes of an object, ensure the object is not None. This can be avoided by checking the object\u2019s existence or initialization before use.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the status and warnings of entities like furnaces and inserters to ensure they are operating correctly and have the necessary resources.\n- Ensure all entities are correctly fueled and connected to necessary inputs and outputs to avoid operational halts."}
