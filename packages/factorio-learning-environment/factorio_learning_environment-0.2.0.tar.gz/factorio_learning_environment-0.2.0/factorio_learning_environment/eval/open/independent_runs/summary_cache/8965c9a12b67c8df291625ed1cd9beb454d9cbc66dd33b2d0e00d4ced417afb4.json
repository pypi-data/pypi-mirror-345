{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5) - currently working\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=4.0) - currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=7.5) - not connected to power network, no input liquid\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole (x=1.5, y=7.5)\n\nThe system is currently not operational as the boiler has run out of fuel. Coal was added in step 82 and 84, but by step 87 it was depleted again.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (x=18.5, y=73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=18.5, y=73.5) mining iron ore - currently not working due to power outage and full chest\n- Wooden chest (x=18.5, y=75.5) collecting iron ore from the drill (currently contains 800 iron ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=19.0, y=77.0) with 17 coal, currently working with 4 iron ore\n- Inserter (x=19.5, y=78.5) to move iron plates from furnace to chest - not working due to power outage\n- Wooden chest (x=19.5, y=79.5) for iron plate storage (currently contains 13 iron plates)\n- Chest output inserter (x=19.5, y=80.5) to extract plates from chest - not working due to power outage\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=19.5, y=81.5) with belts extending to (x=14.5, y=78.5) - currently contains 32 iron plates\n- Additional belt system from (x=8.5, y=75.5) to (x=9.5, y=77.5) connecting to the circuit assembly\n- Small electric poles (x=21.5, y=73.5), (x=20.5, y=75.5), (x=21.5, y=78.5), (x=21.5, y=80.5)\n\nThe system is partially working with the stone furnace still smelting iron ore into plates, but the electric components are not operational due to power outage.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (x=-48.5, y=78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=-48.5, y=78.5) mining copper ore - currently not working due to power outage and full chest\n- Wooden chest (x=-48.5, y=80.5) collecting copper ore from the drill (currently contains 800 copper ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=-48.0, y=82.0) with 16 coal, currently working with 5 copper ore\n- Inserter (x=-47.5, y=83.5) to move copper plates from furnace to chest - not working due to power outage\n- Wooden chest (x=-47.5, y=84.5) for copper plate storage (currently contains 12 copper plates)\n- Chest output inserter (x=-47.5, y=85.5) to extract plates from chest - not working due to power outage\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=-47.5, y=86.5) extending to (x=-22.5, y=86.5) - currently contains 103 copper plates\n- Small electric poles (x=-45.5, y=78.5), (x=-46.5, y=80.5), (x=-45.5, y=83.5), (x=-45.5, y=85.5)\n\nThe system is partially working with the stone furnace still smelting copper ore into plates, but the electric components are not operational due to power outage.\n\n### Circuit Production System\nConsists of:\n\n#### Copper Cable Assembly (x=-6.5, y=74.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (x=-6.5, y=74.5) set to produce copper cables - currently not working due to power outage\n- Input inserter (x=-8.5, y=74.5) to feed copper plates - not working due to power"}
