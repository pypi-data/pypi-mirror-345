{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a machine or entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into the copper drill failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when Entities Run Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of your mining drills and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Replenish fuel as needed to avoid stoppages.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process, such as ores, to avoid warnings and inefficiencies.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the item is not present in the inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity.\n  - `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n  - `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity.\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity."}
