{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the steam engine and boiler, with pipes at various positions including (x=15.5, y=17.5), (x=16.5, y=17.5), (x=17.5, y=17.5), etc.\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with pipes at various positions including (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=23.5), etc.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions including (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), etc.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that there is a clear path for pipes to connect the offshore pump at (x=-9.5, y=24.5) to the boiler at (x=1.5, y=23.0). Check for any obstructions or incorrect placements that may block the connection.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Verify that the path from the boiler at (x=1.5, y=23.0) to the steam engine at (x=17.5, y=20.5) is clear of any placement blockages. Adjust the positioning of pipes to ensure a successful connection.\n\n### Errors when Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Before attempting to place a small electric pole, ensure that there is a suitable position available. Avoid areas where placement is blocked by other entities or terrain features.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target position is not already occupied. Remove existing entities if necessary to clear the space.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Used to place entities on the map. Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before placement to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler_position`: Position for placing the boiler, ensure it is not occupied before attempting placement.\n- `pipe`: Type `int`, representing the number of pipes available in inventory.\n- `pipe_to_ground`: Type `int`, representing the number of underground pipes available in inventory.\n- `boiler`: Type `int`, representing the number of boilers available in inventory.\n- `offshore_pump`: Type `int`, representing the number of offshore pumps available in inventory."}
