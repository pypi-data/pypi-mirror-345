{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Source: Iron Ore\n  - Result: Iron Plate\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\n  - Fueled with wood\n  - Status: Working\n  - Output blocked by item on the ground\n  - Resources: Coal\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 0.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: Empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions before attempting to place entities like Burner Mining Drills and Wooden Chests. Consider using smaller BuildingBoxes if placement fails due to size constraints.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or conveyor belt) to accept the output from mining drills to prevent output blockage.\n\n### Errors when adding fuel or resources\n- Ensure that the required resources (e.g., coal) are available in your inventory before attempting to add them to entities like Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors when transferring items\n- Verify that the target entity (e.g., Wooden Chest) exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract or transfer items."}
