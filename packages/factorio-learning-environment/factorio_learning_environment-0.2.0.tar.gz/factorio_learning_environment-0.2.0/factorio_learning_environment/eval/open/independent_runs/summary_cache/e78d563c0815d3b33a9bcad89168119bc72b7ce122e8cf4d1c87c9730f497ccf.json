{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the current execution steps. The agent has been attempting to place offshore pumps and boilers but has not succeeded in establishing any functional structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Position Checking and Placement\n- **Offshore Pump and Boiler Placement Failures**: Numerous attempts to place offshore pumps and boilers have failed due to unsuitable positions. Ensure that the terrain is suitable for placement and that there is enough space for the entities.\n- **Repeated Position Checking**: The agent has been checking multiple positions for offshore pumps and boilers without success. Consider using a more strategic approach to identify suitable locations, such as analyzing the terrain more effectively before attempting placement.\n\n### Validation Errors\n- **BuildingBox Validation Errors**: Errors indicate that the height and width inputs should be valid integers. Ensure that the dimensions provided for building entities are correctly formatted and valid.\n\n### Type Errors\n- **Type Conversion Issues**: Errors such as \"int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a real number\" suggest issues with type conversion. Ensure that all inputs to functions requiring specific data types are correctly formatted and converted as needed.\n\n### Undefined Functions\n- **Undefined Function 'inspect_terrain'**: The error indicates that the function 'inspect_terrain' is not defined. Ensure that all functions used in the code are properly defined and imported if necessary.\n\n### Callable Object Errors\n- **'Position' Object Not Callable**: Errors indicate that a 'Position' object is being used incorrectly as a callable. Review the usage of objects and ensure they are used in accordance with their intended functionality.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in placing structures and avoid repeated unsuccessful attempts."}
