{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Storage at Position (-11.5, -49.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) containing 169 iron ore.\n\n### Coal Storage at Position (54.5, -78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (54.5, -78.5) containing 800 coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) containing 98 iron plates.\n\n### Target Storage at Position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) containing wood, coal, and iron ore.\n\n### Target Storage at Position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting resources\n- Ensure you are within the correct proximity to the target entity before attempting to extract resources. The repeated failure to extract iron ore and coal suggests a positioning issue.\n\n### Errors when inserting into a full inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an inventory, verify that there is sufficient space. The stone furnace at position (-14, -49) is full, leading to failed insertion attempts.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target location before placing an entity. The attempt to place a wooden chest at (-9.0, -47.0) failed because the player was too far away. The maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Function to place an entity at a specified position. Failed when the target position was too far from the player.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `new_iron_ore_chest_position`: Position variable for placing a new iron ore chest, which was attempted at (-9.0, -47.0).\n- `current_inventory`: Dictionary maintaining the current inventory state, including items like 'burner-inserter', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
