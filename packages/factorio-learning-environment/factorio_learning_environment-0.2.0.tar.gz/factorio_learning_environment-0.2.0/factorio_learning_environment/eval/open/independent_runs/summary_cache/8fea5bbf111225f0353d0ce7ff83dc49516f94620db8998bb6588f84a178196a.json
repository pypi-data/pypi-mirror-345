{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these components at various positions\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Storage Facilities\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs and no research in progress\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple PipeGroups at various positions, some are operational while others remain empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected to form a continuous path between entities. Check for any obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Boiler Not Operational\n- Verify that the boiler is properly connected to both a water source and a steam engine. Ensure that there are no gaps or incorrect connections in the pipe network leading to the boiler.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the electricity network to ensure that all poles and connected entities are properly aligned and that the network is complete. Verify that the power source is operational and connected to the network.\n\n### Placement Blockage Errors\n- Before placing pipes, ensure that the target tile is clear of any obstructions or existing entities. Adjust placement to avoid overlaps.\n\n### Boiler Connection Errors\n- Double-check the connections between the boiler and its water source, ensuring that the pipes are correctly placed and connected without any gaps.\n\n### Repeated Pipe Connection Failures\n- Review the layout and ensure that the pipes are correctly positioned to connect the boiler and steam engine. Consider re-evaluating the path for potential obstructions or misalignments that prevent successful connection."}
