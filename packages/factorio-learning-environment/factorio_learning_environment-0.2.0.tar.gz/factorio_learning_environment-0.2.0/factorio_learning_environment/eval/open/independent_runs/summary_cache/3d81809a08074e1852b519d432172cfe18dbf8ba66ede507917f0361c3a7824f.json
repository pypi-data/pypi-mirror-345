{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -49.5) and (-10.5, -49.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -49.5) and (-9.5, -49.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that the upstream supply of items is sufficient to keep inserters active. Check the source entities and ensure they are producing or have items available.\n\n### Failed to Clear Drop Position Chests\n- Make sure that the chests at drop positions are not full. Regularly empty or manage inventory in these chests to prevent blockage.\n\n### Low Resource Warnings\n- Monitor resource levels in chests and ensure timely restocking to maintain continuous operation of mining drills and furnaces.\n\n### Blocked Furnace Belts\n- Ensure that the output of furnaces is not blocked by full belts or chests. Regularly clear outputs to maintain production flow.\n\n### Automation Failures in Resource Extraction\n- Verify that all automated systems have the necessary resources and space to operate effectively. Regularly check for any warnings or errors in the system."}
