There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\u201d\n\u2022 Drill Inserter at (-13.5, -47.5)\n\u2003\u2013 Configured with pickup at (-12.5, -47.5) and drop at (-14.5, -47.5).\n\u2022 Belt Network:\n\u2003\u2013 Includes an existing transport belt at (-15.5, -48.5) and a placed belt at (-16.5, -48.5) with spacing=1.\n\u2003\u2013 BeltGroup Segment A runs from (-16.5, -48.5) to (-16.5, -47.5) comprising 6 belts (WORKING).\n\u2003\u2013 BeltGroup Segment B2 connects (-15.5, -47.5) to the smelting network input at (-14.5, -47.5) (WORKING), while Segment B1 remains unestablished.\n\u2022 Sink Chest Integration and Output Mechanism:\n\u2003\u2013 The original sink chest at (-14.5, -48.5) was removed (after several placement attempts) to allow direct ore deposition.\n\u2003\u2013 A new output inserter was successfully placed at (-16.5, -48.5) (to the LEFT of the former sink chest location) and rotated to face RIGHT for ore extraction.\n\u2003\u2013 The output chest remains at (-10.5, -48.5), and the wooden chest at (-14.5, -51.5) still persists.\n\u2003\u2013 An attempt to place a transport belt at (-14.5, -48.5) (for direct belt deposition) failed due to placement range constraints.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Placement Range Constraints:\n\u2003\u2013 When re-placing entities such as sink chests or transport belts, verify that the player is positioned close enough to the target location. Errors at (-14.5, -48.5) indicate that failing to move closer (player at 0,0) violates the max placement distance.\n\u2022 Collision with Existing Entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Output inserter placements encountered collisions with nearby transport belts (e.g. at positions (-12.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-16.5, -48.5)). Ensure that adjacent tiles are checked for occupancy and adjust spacing, direction, or reference position accordingly.\n\u2022 Conflicting Entity Removal and Re\u2010placement:\n\u2003\u2013 Temporary removal of obstructing entities (such as the transport belt at (-16.5, -48.5)) can clear space for placing output inserters. However, re\u2011placement must be attempted only after confirming that no residual conflicts remain.\n\u2022 Downstream Impact of Entity Removal:\n\u2003\u2013 Removing critical sink integrations (e.g. the sink chest) without a suitable alternative may lead to warnings (\u201coutput blocked by item on the ground\u201d). Validate that downstream extraction or deposition interfaces are available before final removal.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nshift_entity_local(entity: Entity, offset: Tuple[float, float]) -> Entity\n\u2003\u2022 Shifts the given entity\u2019s position locally by the specified offset.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Previously used successfully; note potential repositioning issues.\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 furnace_input_chest_pos (Position) \u2013 holds the position of the furnace\u2019s input chest.\n\u2022 current_player_inventory (Inventory) \u2013 tracks the player\u2019s inventory state."}
