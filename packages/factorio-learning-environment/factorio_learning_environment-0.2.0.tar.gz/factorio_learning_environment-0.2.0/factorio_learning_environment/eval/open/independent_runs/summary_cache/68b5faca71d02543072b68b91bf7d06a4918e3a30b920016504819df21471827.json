This can be verified by checking the chest's inventory.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory or chest\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of chests and ensure there is enough space to accommodate new items. Empty chests when they are full to prevent interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure sufficient fuel is available in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly harvest or acquire fuel to maintain a steady supply."}
