{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5) and a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), and others, with the chest at (4.5, -58.5) containing 507 units of iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0), all with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\" and containing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), and (-8.5, -50.5), all marked with warnings that they are full and containing iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources or processed goods are regularly emptied to prevent production halts. Consider setting up automated systems to transfer items from full chests to available storage.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly check the supply of raw materials to furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Automate the supply chain to prevent furnaces from running out of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the player's inventory with items like 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
