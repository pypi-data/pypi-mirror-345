{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) and (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnaces.\n- Transport Belt system connecting the furnaces to a wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items, connected to the chest.\n- Transport Belt system connecting the chest to an Iron Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5).\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) storing iron plates.\n\n#### Coal-Powered Electricity Generator\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5) fueled by coal.\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5) generating electricity.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n- Pipe system connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the required source items. Check if the connected entities are supplying the necessary items.\n\n#### Extraction Errors\n- When extracting items from a chest, ensure the chest contains the specified quantity of items to avoid extraction errors.\n\n#### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Ensure that there is space available at the destination for the inserter's output to avoid blockage. Check for any items on the ground or ensure a sink entity is in place to accept the output."}
