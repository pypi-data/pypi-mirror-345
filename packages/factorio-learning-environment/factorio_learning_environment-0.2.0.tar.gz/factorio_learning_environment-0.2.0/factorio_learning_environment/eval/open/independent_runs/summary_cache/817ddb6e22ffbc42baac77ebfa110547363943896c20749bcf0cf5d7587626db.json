{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. Repeated attempts to locate or place an Automation Lab at (0.5, 2.5) did not yield a persistent Lab structure, and although furnace entities (an alternative furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)) were referenced during smelting operations, none were newly constructed by the agent. The final map state remains empty.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n  \u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional parameters when calling functions like get_entities. Always verify the function\u2019s signature and use only the accepted parameters.\n  \n\u2022 Handling Null Results\n  \u2013 Check that API calls or entity retrievals return a valid, non-None value before iterating over the result. Use fallbacks (such as an empty list) to prevent errors like \u201c\u2018NoneType\u2019 object is not iterable.\u201d\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Issues\n  \u2013 Confirm that the Lab component exists in the inventory before attempting placement to prevent placement failures.\n  \u2013 Ensure all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available in sufficient quantities before crafting a Lab.\n  \n\u2022 Resource Chain Management\n  \u2013 Monitor and address shortages in key resources (such as iron plates and copper plates) early in the production chain. Employ proper smelting or crafting processes to secure intermediate items needed for subsequent steps in Lab production."}
