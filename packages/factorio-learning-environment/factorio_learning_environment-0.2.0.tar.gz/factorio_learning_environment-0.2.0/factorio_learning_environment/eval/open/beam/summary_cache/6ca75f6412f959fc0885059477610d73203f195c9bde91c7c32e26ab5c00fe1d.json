{"content": "The output indicates that I have a wide array of technologies available for research, but there is no current research in progress. The technologies include various automation, logistics, and energy-related advancements, but many of them may require specific resources or science packs to unlock.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- **No Recipes Available**: All crafting recipes remain disabled, which limits my ability to progress.\n- **No Research in Progress**: I need to initiate research to unlock new recipes.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Identify Basic Research Needs**: I should focus on researching the most fundamental technologies that could unlock crafting recipes. \n2. **Gather Required Resources for Research**: Determine what resources or science packs are necessary for initiating research on basic technologies.\n\nGiven that I have wood, coal, iron ore, and copper ore, I can potentially craft some basic science packs if they are enabled.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Check for Basic Science Pack Recipes**: I will check if I can craft any basic science packs that might be needed for research.\n2. **Initiate Research on Basic Technologies**: If I can craft science packs, I will do so and then initiate research.\n\nLet\u2019s check if I can craft any basic science packs with my current inventory.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for basic science pack recipes to see if they are enabled\nbasic_science_pack_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.BasicSciencePack)\nprint(f\"Recipe for Basic Science Pack: {basic_science_pack_recipe}\")\n\n# If the recipe is enabled, attempt to craft some basic science packs\nif basic_science_pack_recipe and basic_science_pack_recipe.enabled:\n    craft_item(Prototype.BasicSciencePack, quantity=5)  # Attempt to craft several basic science packs\n\n# Check the inventory after attempting to craft basic science packs\nfinal_inventory_after_science_pack_check = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory after crafting basic science packs attempt: {final_inventory_after_science_pack_check}\")  # Verify what is available now.", "summary_range": "[1-126]"}
