{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Processing Facility\n- **Pumpjack** at position (17.5, 40.5) - Unpowered with crude oil available\n- **Oil Refinery** at position (24.5, 44.5) - Unpowered, configured for basic oil processing\n- **Chemical Plant** at position (31.5, 46.5) - Unpowered, requires coal for plastic production\n- Pipe networks:\n  - Crude oil pipes from pumpjack to refinery (system 12891, status: EMPTY)\n  - Petroleum gas pipes from refinery to chemical plant (system 12894, status: EMPTY)\n\n### Coal Mining Operation\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at position (34.5, 20.5) - Unpowered with coal available\n- Transport belt system moving coal (23 units) towards chemical plant (status: WORKING)\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Under Construction)\n- Multiple **Offshore Pumps** placed and removed in area (-11.0, 0.0) to (-9.0, 1.0)\n- No currently operational boilers or steam engines\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Construction Issues\n- Repeated boiler placement failures (-9.0, -2.0) and surrounding areas - clear all entities before placement attempts\n- Offshore pump placement errors - verify water source exists at target position before placement\n- Multiple \"exhaustive search\" failures - implement proper position validation before search attempts\n\n### System Scanning Errors\n- GetEntities API failures - verify position parameters and radius values\n- Area scanning implementation errors - check for proper water source detection logic\n\n### Persistent Infrastructure Problems\n- Power network remains non-functional - prioritize clearing space for boiler placement\n- Oil facility still unpowered - complete power generation before addressing oil processing\n\n### Construction Best Practices\n- Always verify entity positions are clear before placement\n- Implement proper error handling for placement failures\n- Check water source availability before pump placement\n- Clear larger areas when encountering placement conflicts\n\n### API Usage\n- Handle GetEntities exceptions with proper error checking\n- Verify position parameters before API calls\n- Implement fallback procedures for placement failures"}
