First line:\n   - Stone furnace (position 45.0, -80.0)\n   - Output inserter (position 45.5, -81.5)\n   - Output chest (position 45.5, -82.5) containing 34 iron plates\n   - Input inserter (position 45.5, -78.5)\n   - Input chest (position 45.5, -77.5)\n\n2. Second line:\n   - Stone furnace (position 47.0, -80.0)\n   - Output inserter (position 47.5, -81.5)\n   - Output chest (position 47.5, -82.5) containing 29 iron plates\n   - Input inserter (position 47.5, -78.5)\n   - Input chest (position 47.5, -77.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station (Around position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner inserter (position -14.5, -51.5)\n- Wooden chest (position -13.5, -50.5)\n- Output inserter (position -12.5, -50.5)\n- Long transport belt system connecting to smelting area (from -11.5, -50.5 to 44.5, -81.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Always check if target position is clear before placing entities\n   - Remove existing entities if they need to be replaced\n   - Verify entity dimensions when placing larger entities like mining drills\n\n2. Transport System Issues\n   - Ensure belts are properly connected and oriented\n   - Clear blocked belts before attempting to rebuild transport systems\n   - Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with connected entities\n\n3. Resource Management\n   - Keep mining drills fueled to prevent work stoppage\n   - Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow\n   - Ensure proper fuel distribution to all burner entities\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- None identified in provided logs\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the game world\n  Success: When target position is clear\n  Failure: When position is blocked by existing entity"}
