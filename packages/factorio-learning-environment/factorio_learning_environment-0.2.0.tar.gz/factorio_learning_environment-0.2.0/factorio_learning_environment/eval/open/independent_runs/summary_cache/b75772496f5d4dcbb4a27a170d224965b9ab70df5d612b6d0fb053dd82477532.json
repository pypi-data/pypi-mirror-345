{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. Multiple attempts were made to craft and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but none were completed due to resource shortages and inventory issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Consistency:\n  - Use the correct signature for get_entities. Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Retrieval and Placement:\n  - Before iterating over retrieved entities, confirm that the result is a valid list (not None).\n  - Ensure that a Lab is available in the inventory before attempting to place one at a designated position.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting Resource Requirements:\n  - Verify that all sub-ingredients for Lab crafting\u2014including iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper cables\u2014are available in sufficient quantities.\n  - Strengthen resource production (e.g., smelting additional iron and copper plates) and confirm that the production chain (using furnaces and crafting machines) meets recipe requirements to avoid cascading crafting failures."}
