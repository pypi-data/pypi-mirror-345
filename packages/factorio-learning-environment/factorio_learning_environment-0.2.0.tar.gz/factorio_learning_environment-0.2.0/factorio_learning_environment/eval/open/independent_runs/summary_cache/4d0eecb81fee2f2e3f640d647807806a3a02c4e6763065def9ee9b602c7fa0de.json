{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (61.0, -54.0) with ingredients: {'iron-ore': 14, 'iron-plate': 100}\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (62.5, -53.5) connected to the furnace at (61.0, -54.0) and a wooden chest at (61.5, -52.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (61.5, -52.5) containing {'stone-brick': 10, 'wood': 6, 'coal': 650, 'stone': 5}\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) containing {'coal': 73}\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (44.5, -83.5) containing {'coal': 650, 'iron-plate': 300}\n\n### Belt Systems\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- **BeltGroup** connecting various positions with multiple belts, including:\n  - From (45.5, -82.5) to (48.5, -79.5)\n  - From (43.5, -80.5) to (63.5, -50.5)\n  - From (42.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -46.5)\n  - From (44.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -54.5)\n  - From (49.5, -80.5) to (60.5, -69.5)\n  - From (49.5, -78.5) to (58.5, -69.5)\n  - From (50.5, -79.5) to (59.5, -70.5)\n  - From (59.5, -68.5) to (67.5, -54.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connections\n- **Failed to Connect Belt Segments**: Ensure that the path for the transport belts is valid and unobstructed. Check that the positions are accessible and that there are no obstacles blocking the path.\n- **Cannot Connect Belts Directly to Chests**: Use an inserter to connect belts to chests. Belts cannot directly input items into a chest without an inserter.\n\n### Inventory Management Issues\n- **Failed to Clear Obstacles Due to Full Inventory**: Regularly manage and clear your inventory to ensure space is available for picking up items or clearing obstacles.\n\n### Extraction and Supply Errors\n- **Failed to Clear Remaining Output Blockage**: Ensure that the output destination is clear and capable of receiving items. Check for blockages or full inventories at the destination.\n- **Failed to Supply Furnaces with Iron Ore**: Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_belts**: Attempts to connect belts between specified positions. Failure occurs if the path is invalid or obstructed.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like transport belts, burner inserters, coal, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n- `furnace_ingredients`: Dict[str, Dict[str, int]] - Tracks the ingredients in each furnace, such as iron ore and iron plates."}
