{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnaces at positions:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n- Inserters for transferring iron plates:\n  - Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) transferring from furnace at (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) to chest at (x=-17.5, y=-54.5)\n  - Inserter at position (x=-12.5, y=-46.5) transferring from furnace at (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) to chest at (x=-16.5, y=-54.5)\n  - Inserter at position (x=-10.5, y=-46.5) transferring from furnace at (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) to chest at (x=-15.5, y=-54.5)\n- Storage chests for iron plates:\n  - Chest at position (x=-17.5, y=-54.5)\n  - Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-54.5)\n  - Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-54.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Drop chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5)\n- Storage chest at position (x=6.5, y=-56.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Full chest at position (x=-2.5, y=-52.5)\n- Less full chest at position (x=-2.5, y=-52.5)\n\n### Mining and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0)\n- Wooden chests at positions:\n  - Chest at position (x=5.5, y=-60.5)\n  - Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5)\n  - Chest at position (x=6.5, y=-56.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests do not become full to avoid halting production. Regularly transfer items from full chests to maintain workflow.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Monitor furnace inputs to avoid \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure inserters are correctly positioned and have a clear path to transfer items between entities. Check inserter fuel levels to maintain operation.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the player's current inventory items and quantities.\n  - `furnace_source`: Inventory - Represents the input inventory of a furnace.\n  - `furnace_result`: Inventory - Represents the output inventory of a furnace."}
