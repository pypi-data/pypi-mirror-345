{"content": "It appears that the script is not progressing beyond the initial print statement, and no further output is being displayed. This indicates that there might be an issue with how the script is being executed or how the outputs are being captured in the Factorio REPL environment. Here are some steps to address this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Environment Setup**: Ensure that the Factorio REPL environment is correctly set up and that the script has the necessary permissions to interact with the game. Check if the game is running and that the script is being executed in the correct context.\n\n2. **Check Output Capture**: Make sure that the console or log where the script outputs are supposed to appear is correctly configured. It's possible that outputs are being redirected or not displayed due to configuration issues.\n\n3. **Simplify the Script**: Try running an even simpler script to verify that basic print statements work. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   print(\"Test: Basic output check.\")\n   ```\n\n   If this does not display, the issue is likely with the environment setup or output capture.\n\n4. **Debugging**: Add additional debugging statements or use logging to capture outputs in a file if the console output is not reliable. This can help determine if the script is executing at all.\n\n5. **Check for Errors**: Ensure that there are no syntax errors or other issues in the script that might prevent it from running. Even though the initial print statement works, subsequent code might have issues.\n\n6. **Consult Documentation**: Review any available documentation for the Factorio REPL environment to ensure that the script is being executed in the correct manner and that all necessary configurations are in place.\n\nIf the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to support forums or communities related to Factorio scripting for additional assistance.", "summary_range": "[1-356]"}
