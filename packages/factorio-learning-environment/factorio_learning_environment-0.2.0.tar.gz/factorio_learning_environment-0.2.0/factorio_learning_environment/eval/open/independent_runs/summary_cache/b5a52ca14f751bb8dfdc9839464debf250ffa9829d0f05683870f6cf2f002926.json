{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.5, -50.5) for mining iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -53.5) refueled with coal, responsible for moving items.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0), currently out of fuel and lacking ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5), responsible for moving items to the furnace, currently out of fuel.\n\n### Transport and Storage Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -51.5) and another at position (-14.5, -48.5), both empty.\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at position (-16.5, -54.5) to (-14.5, -54.5) and outputs from (-12.5, -54.5) to (-10.5, -54.5), consisting of 5 belts, currently empty.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -52.5), currently out of fuel.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to get entities\n- Ensure the correct position is specified when attempting to retrieve an entity. Verify the entity's existence at the given position before calling the get_entity function.\n\n### Errors in placing structures\n- Ensure there is sufficient space and a valid position available before attempting to place a wooden chest or any other structure.\n\n### Errors in resource supply\n- Ensure iron ore is being effectively transported to the furnace. Check the connection between the mining drill and the furnace to ensure ore is reaching its destination.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel all entities that require fuel, such as burner mining drills, inserters, and furnaces, to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations."}
