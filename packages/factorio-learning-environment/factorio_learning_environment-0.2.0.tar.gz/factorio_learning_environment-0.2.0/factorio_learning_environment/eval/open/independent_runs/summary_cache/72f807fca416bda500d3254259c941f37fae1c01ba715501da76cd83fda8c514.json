{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0)\nCurrently not operational - drill has no fuel, furnace has no fuel but contains 10 iron plates\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting System at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) with 4 coal\nSystem blocked - furnace contains 2 iron plates and 9 copper ore\n\n### Power Generation System at (-14.5, 19.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) - working and producing water\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) with 10 coal\n- Steam engine at (-8.5, 19.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups in various states:\n  - One water-filled pipe group (system 11442)\n  - 15 empty pipe groups attempting connections\nSystem still not operational - connection issues persist\n\n### Research Lab System\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs (10)\nCurrently not operational due to no power\n\n### Unused Smelting Area\nGroup of 4 unused furnaces at:\n- (0.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 4.0)\n- (4.0, 4.0)\nAll have fuel (23 coal each) but no ingredients\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nElectric pole network (Group ID 2520) connecting various areas but currently not operational (0 voltage)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Connection Issues\n- Connection points between components are being blocked - ensure proper spacing and alignment\n- Remove blocking pipe groups before attempting new connections\n- Maintain clear paths between connection points of boiler, pump and steam engine\n- Create direct, minimal pipe connections instead of complex networks\n\n### Production Line Blockages\n- Mining drills are getting blocked due to full output furnaces\n- Implement regular collection of finished products from furnaces\n\n### Resource Management\n- Coal shortages in critical components - maintain coal supply for mining drills\n- Better inventory management needed - agent frequently runs out of coal while having excess of other materials\n\n### Pipe System Issues\n- Too many redundant pipe groups being created (15+ groups)\n- Clean up ALL pipe groups before creating new connections\n- Create minimal, direct connections between components\n- Focus on one connection at a time: water to boiler first, then boiler to steam engine\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Lab and other electrical components remain unpowered\n- Focus on completing one working power generation setup before expanding the network\n- Ensure both water and steam connections are properly established before expecting power generation\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Check inventory before attempting to insert items\n- Maintain a minimum stock of essential resources like coal"}
