{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED and warnings about no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status NO_FUEL and warnings about being out of fuel. It is connected to multiple pipes.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING, supplying water to the system.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Pipe Group** for fluid system 1059 starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) with status EMPTY.\n- **Pipe Group** for fluid system 1070 starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, supplying water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group** with poles distributed across various positions, including (x=27.5, y=26.5) and (x=35.5, y=20.5), with a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Ensure that steam engines are properly connected to a source of steam. Check pipe connections and ensure there is a fluid present in the connections.\n\n### Errors Due to Boiler Fuel Shortage\n- Regularly refuel boilers to prevent them from running out of fuel. Monitor fuel levels and automate refueling if possible.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Network Status\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected and not blocked. Ensure that the fluid system is complete and capable of transporting the required fluids.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- **Important Variables**: None explicitly mentioned in the provided logs."}
