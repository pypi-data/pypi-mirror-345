{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo completed structures have been successfully placed on the map so far. Multiple attempts were made to locate or place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) but none succeeded, and no other composite structures (such as furnaces for production) were built by the agent in these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Consistency:\n\u2003\u2013 When using get_entities, adhere strictly to its defined signature. Avoid unrecognized keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments. Verify the required parameter format before calling.\n\u2022 Inventory Validation for Placement:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the intended item (such as a Lab) exists in inventory prior to placement. This prevents errors like \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d during placement attempts.\n\u2022 Handling Empty or None Returns:\n\u2003\u2013 Check for None when retrieving entities and use a fallback (such as an empty list) before iterating. This avoids runtime errors when expecting an iterable.\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Sufficiency:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all sub-ingredients for complex craftable items (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables for a Lab) are available in the proper amounts. Review error messages for missing components and focus on producing sufficient intermediate items to meet crafting requirements."}
