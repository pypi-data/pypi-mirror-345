{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), refueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), waiting for source items, transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), waiting for source items, transferring iron ore between chests.\n  - At position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), waiting for source items, transferring items to furnaces.\n  - At position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5), waiting for source items, transferring items within the facility.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace 1 at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), processing iron ore into iron plates, currently out of fuel.\n  - Furnace 2 at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), processing iron ore into iron plates, currently no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), storing iron plates.\n  - At position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), empty.\n  - At position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5), storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or drills) have items available for the inserters to transfer. Check the supply chain to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Fueling\n- Regularly check and refuel furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel, which halts production.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Inspection\n- When using functions like `inspect_inventory`, make sure to pass the correct type of argument (Entity or Position object) instead of an incorrect type like an integer.\n\n### Errors with Ore Availability\n- Ensure that there is a continuous supply of iron ore to the furnaces to maintain production efficiency. Regularly check ore chests and refill them as needed."}
