{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load Copper Ore into the active furnace has failed due to an error indicating that the furnace already contains stone. This suggests that the furnace is currently holding **1 piece of stone** and is unable to accept additional items until the existing materials are processed or removed.\n\n### Current Status:\n- The active furnace is still in a **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"** state for smelting Copper Ore because it cannot process both stone and Copper Ore simultaneously.\n- The inventory shows that the furnace contains **1 piece of stone** and **18 Iron Plates**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace needs to either process the stone or have it removed before it can accept the Copper Ore for smelting.\n- The presence of stone in the furnace may have been overlooked during the previous interactions.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Stone from the Furnace**: Remove the existing stone from the furnace to clear the way for Copper Ore.\n2. **Reinsert Copper Ore**: After clearing the stone, insert the Copper Ore into the furnace for processing.\n3. **Monitor the Smelting Operation**: Ensure that the furnace begins the smelting process for Copper Plates.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the stone from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Remove 1 piece of stone from the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total inventory after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-302]"}
