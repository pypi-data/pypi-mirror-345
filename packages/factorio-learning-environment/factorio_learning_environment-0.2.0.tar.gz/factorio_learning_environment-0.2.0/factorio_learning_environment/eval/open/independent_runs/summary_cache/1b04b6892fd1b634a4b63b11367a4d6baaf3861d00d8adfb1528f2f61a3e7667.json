{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace and a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Laboratory Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple PipeGroups exist with varying statuses:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-50.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-47.5, -122.5) with water\n- PipeGroup at Position (-45.5, -123.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions indicating an extensive piping network\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a pipe. Remove any existing entities at the target position first.\n\n### Steam Engine Power Generation Issues\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to both the power network and the fluid input. Ensure that the boiler is receiving water and fuel to generate steam.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a powered electricity network. Check connections to the small electric poles and ensure they are receiving power.\n\n### Boiler Connection Warnings\n- Make sure that the boiler is correctly connected to both the water source and the steam engine. Check for any missing pipes or incorrect connections."}
