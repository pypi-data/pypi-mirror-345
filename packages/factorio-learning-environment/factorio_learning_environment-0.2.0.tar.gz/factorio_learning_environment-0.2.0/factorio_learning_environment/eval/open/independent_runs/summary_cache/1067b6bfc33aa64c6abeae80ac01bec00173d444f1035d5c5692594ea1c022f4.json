{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) supplied with iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) actively producing iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) intended to move items between the furnace and chest\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple Pipe Groups at various positions, primarily empty and not connected to fluid systems:\n- PipeGroup at position (-42.5, -124.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-50.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-44.5, -121.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-48.5, -119.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups in the positive y-coordinates, indicating potential future expansion\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not conducting research\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected to the intended fluid systems. Verify that the starting and ending positions are correct and that there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors when Connecting to Power Network\n- Make sure you have the necessary items, such as Small Electric Poles, in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network.\n- Verify that the electric poles are within range to establish a connection between the power sources and the consumers.\n\n### Errors in Setting Research\n- Ensure that the lab is properly supplied with the necessary science packs and that research is selected and initiated correctly.\n\n### Errors in Supplying Furnaces\n- Confirm that the source of materials, such as iron ore, is available and accessible. Check for any obstructions or full inventories that may prevent the transfer of materials.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Connection\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source and that the power network is active. Verify the placement of electric poles to provide electricity to all connected entities."}
