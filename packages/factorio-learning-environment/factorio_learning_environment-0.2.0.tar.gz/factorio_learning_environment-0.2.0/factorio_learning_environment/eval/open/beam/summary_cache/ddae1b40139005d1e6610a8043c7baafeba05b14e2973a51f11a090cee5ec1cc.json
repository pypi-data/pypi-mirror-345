{"content": "Ah, I see the core issue now. We can't craft a burner inserter directly because it needs iron gear wheels and iron plates which require specific crafting machines. Let's try a simpler approach using transport belts since we have those in our inventory:\n\n```python\n# Get the drill details\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Found drill at {drill.position}\")\nprint(f\"Drill drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\n\n# Move to the drill's drop position\nmove_to(drill.drop_position)\nprint(f\"Moved to drill drop position\")\n\n# Place a transport belt at the drop position\nbelt = place_entity(\n    Prototype.TransportBelt,\n    position=drill.drop_position\n)\nprint(f\"Placed transport belt at {belt.position}\")\n\n# Rotate belt to point towards where we want items to go\nrotate_entity(belt, Direction.DOWN)\nprint(\"Rotated belt\")\n\n# Add fuel to drill if needed\nif drill.status == EntityStatus.NO_FUEL:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis approach uses transport belts (which we have 39 of in our inventory) instead of trying to craft inserters. The belt should be able to move items away from the drill's output position. Let's see if this helps resolve the WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION status.", "summary_range": "[1-2826]"}
