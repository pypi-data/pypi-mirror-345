{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Array at position (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1** at position (-13.0, -50.0):  \n  - Status: Working  \n  - Fuel: 49 coal  \n  - Input: 32 iron ore  \n  - Output: 14 iron plates  \n- **Furnace 2** at position (-11.0, -50.0):  \n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt  \n  - Fuel: 29 coal  \n  - Output: 10 iron plates  \n- **Furnace 3** at position (-8.0, -50.0):  \n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt  \n  - Fuel: 19 coal  \n\nThis structure is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnaces are placed in a linear array near an iron ore patch for efficient smelting.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) before attempting to place entities like furnaces. Move closer to the target position before placing.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Always check your inventory for the required items (e.g., iron ore, coal) before attempting to insert them into a furnace. Harvest or craft the necessary items if they are missing.\n\n#### Errors with smelting not progressing\n- Verify that furnaces have both fuel (coal) and input materials (iron ore) to function properly. If smelting stalls, check the furnace's inventory and status for warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n#### Errors with furnace recipe access\n- Avoid attempting to access non-existent attributes like `recipe` on furnace entities. Use the correct API methods to monitor smelting progress and furnace status.\n\n#### Errors with inventory management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have sufficient materials for crafting and smelting. Plan resource harvesting and crafting to avoid running out of critical items like coal or iron ore.\n\n#### Errors with repeated smelting timeouts\n- Investigate furnace warnings and statuses if smelting repeatedly fails. Ensure furnaces have enough fuel and input materials, and avoid overloading them with too many items at once."}
