{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -84.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with full output of iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the storage chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the storage chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Wooden Chests at various positions for storing different resources.\n- Burner Inserters at various positions for moving items between belts and chests.\n- Multiple BeltGroups facilitating the transport of resources across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Entity Attributes\n- Ensure that all entities have the correct attributes before accessing them. For example, a 'BeltGroup' object does not have a 'prototype' attribute.\n\n### Errors with Ingredient Supply\n- Always check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate. Furnaces at positions (-18.0, -70.0) and (0.0, 0.0) are not working due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n### Errors with Full Output\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production, as seen with the furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0).\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the items are available in your inventory. Attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace failed due to a lack of iron ore in the inventory."}
