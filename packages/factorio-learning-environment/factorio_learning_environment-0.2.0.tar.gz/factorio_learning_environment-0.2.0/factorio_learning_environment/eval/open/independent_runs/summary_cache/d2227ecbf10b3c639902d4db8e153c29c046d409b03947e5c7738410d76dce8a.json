This will prevent placement errors such as those encountered with the Transport Belt and Iron Chest.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect crafting methods\n- Remember that certain items, like iron plates, require specific crafting methods or machines (e.g., furnaces for smelting). Ensure you are using the correct method or machine for crafting items.\n\n### Errors when using invalid data types for entity dimensions\n- Validate that all entity dimensions are specified as integers to avoid validation errors during placement or operation.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure you have the required items in your inventory to avoid insertion errors."}
