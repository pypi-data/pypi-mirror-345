{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (6.5, 0.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (20.5, 10.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (16.5, 10.5)\n\n### Furnace Cluster\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) - Status: WORKING, Fuel: {'coal': 10}\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS, Fuel: {'coal': 8}\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 2.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS, Fuel: {'coal': 20}\n\n### Chest\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Wooden chest at position (5.5, 0.5) - Inventory: {'iron-plate': 200}\n\n### Lab\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab at position (x, y) - Status: NO_POWER, Research: automation\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure you have enough small electric poles in your inventory before attempting to place them. The error \"Could not place small-electric-pole at (3.5, 0.5), No small_electric_pole in inventory\" indicates that the agent attempted to place a pole without having any available.\n\n### Errors when connecting to power sources\n- Make sure to check for the existence of power sources (e.g., solar panels, steam engines) before attempting to connect new electric poles. The errors regarding \"Could not find nearest solar-panel\" and \"Could not find nearest steam-engine\" suggest that the agent was trying to connect poles without nearby power sources.\n\n### Errors with inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the second argument for the insert_item function is an entity or entity group, not a position. The error \"AssertionError: The second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup\" indicates a misuse of the function.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
