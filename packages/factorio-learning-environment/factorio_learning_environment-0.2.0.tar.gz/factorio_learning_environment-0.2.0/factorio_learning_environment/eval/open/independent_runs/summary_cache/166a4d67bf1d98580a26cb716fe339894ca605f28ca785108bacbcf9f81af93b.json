{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5). It is currently out of fuel and has a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) containing 112 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-51.5), moving items from the mining drill to the chest, currently out of fuel.\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5), moving items from the chest to a transport belt, with 8 units of coal as fuel.\n  - At position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), currently out of fuel and not operational.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with 9 units of coal as fuel. It is currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients and a full result inventory of 100 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=0.5, y=-1.5), moving items from a transport belt to the furnace, with 8 units of coal as fuel.\n  - At position (x=-1.5, y=0.5), moving items from the furnace, currently out of fuel.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the iron ore mining facility to the iron plate production facility. It includes:\n  - Inputs from position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Outputs from position (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction DOWN.\n  - Composed of 75 belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that the path for connecting transport belts is valid and that the endpoints are correctly aligned to form a continuous path.\n\n### AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'BurnerMiningDrill'\n- Verify that the entity list is being accessed correctly, and ensure that the entities are being referenced with the correct syntax.\n\n### NameError: name 'BurnerMiningDrill' is not defined\n- Ensure that all entity classes are correctly imported and referenced with their full qualified names, such as `entities.BurnerMiningDrill`.\n\n### Exception: Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to insert it into entities.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `entity`: Used in conditional checks for fuel levels, type: `Entity`.\n- `Prototype.Coal`: Represents coal as an item type for inventory operations, type: `Prototype`.\n- `inventory`: Represents the current inventory state, type: `dict[str, int]`."}
