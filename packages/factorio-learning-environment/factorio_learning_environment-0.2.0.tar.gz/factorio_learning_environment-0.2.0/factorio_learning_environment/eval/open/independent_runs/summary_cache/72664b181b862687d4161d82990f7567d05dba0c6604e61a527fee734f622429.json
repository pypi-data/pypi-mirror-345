{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator near position (x=0.0, y=12.0)\n\nThis structure is set up to generate electricity using steam power. The agent has made multiple attempts to connect the boilers to the steam engines using pipes and underground pipes, involving picking up and re-placing both pipes and engines. The steam engines were moved further away from the boilers (now at x=6.5 and x=11.5). Currently, water is piped to the boilers, and pipes connect the steam output of each boiler to the input of the corresponding first-column steam engine. Attempts to connect the steam engines to each other have failed. The system requires fuel for the boilers and electrical connections from the steam engines to be operational.\n\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water. Connected via pipes to the boilers.\n*   **Boiler 1** at position (x=0.0, y=10.5): Heats water into steam (currently requires fuel). Steam output is at (x=1.5, y=10.5). Connected via pipes to Steam Engine 1.\n*   **Boiler 2** at position (x=0.0, y=13.5): Heats water into steam (currently requires fuel). Steam output is at (x=1.5, y=13.5). Connected via pipes to Steam Engine 2.\n*   **Steam Engine 1** at position (x=6.5, y=10.5): Intended to consume steam to generate power. Receives steam input via pipes from Boiler 1.\n*   "}
