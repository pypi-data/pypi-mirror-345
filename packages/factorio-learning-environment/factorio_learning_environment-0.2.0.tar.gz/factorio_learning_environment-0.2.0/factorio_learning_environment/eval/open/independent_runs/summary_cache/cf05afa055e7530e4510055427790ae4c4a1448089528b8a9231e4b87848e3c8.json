{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, actively working.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal extracted by the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5), currently empty and used for refilling purposes.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled by coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) fueled by coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) storing coal for the furnaces.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., mining drill or chest) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Errors with Empty Chests\n- Regularly monitor and refill chests that are part of the production chain to prevent bottlenecks and interruptions in resource flow.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources such as 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n  - `entities`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities present on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
