{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) supplying iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) converting iron ore to iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) transferring items to the furnace.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) moving items between entities.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) for item storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) moving items between entities.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities have items available for the inserters to pick up. Check the supply chain to ensure continuous flow of resources.\n\n#### Errors with Full Chests Preventing Mining\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Consider using larger storage solutions or automating the transfer of items to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n#### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces are consistently supplied with raw materials to maintain production efficiency. Monitor resource levels and automate supply lines to prevent downtime."}
