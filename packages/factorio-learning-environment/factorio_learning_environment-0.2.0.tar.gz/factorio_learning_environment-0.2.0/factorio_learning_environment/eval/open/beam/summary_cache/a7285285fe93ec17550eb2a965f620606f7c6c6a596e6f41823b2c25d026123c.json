{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to craft the **Assembling Machine 1** has failed again due to the same reason as before: it indicates that the recipe requires a specific crafting or smelting machine. This suggests that I need to use a different crafting setup, likely a **Stone Furnace**, to produce the necessary components for the Assembling Machine.\n\n### Current Status:\n1. **Iron Plates**: I have enough iron plates (10), but they cannot be used directly in crafting without the appropriate machine.\n2. **Iron Gear Wheels**: I have enough (8) for crafting.\n3. **Electronic Circuits**: I have the exact amount needed (3).\n\n### Next Objective:\n- **Use a Stone Furnace**: I can use the existing stone furnaces to craft the necessary components (iron plates and iron gear wheels) if I have the required raw materials (iron ore).\n- **Check for Iron Gear Wheels**: I can also check if I can craft iron gear wheels using the stone furnace.\n\n### Immediate Plan:\n1. **Craft Iron Gear Wheels**: If I have enough iron plates, I can create more iron gear wheels in the stone furnace.\n2. **Craft Assembling Machine**: Once I have the necessary components, I will craft the Assembling Machine.\n\nLet\u2019s first check if I can craft iron gear wheels using the stone furnace.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the recipe for Iron Gear Wheel to see if it can be crafted in the stone furnace\niron_gear_wheel_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.IronGearWheel)\nprint(f\"Iron Gear Wheel Recipe: {iron_gear_wheel_recipe}\")  # Review the recipe for crafting Iron Gear Wheel.", "summary_range": "[1-302]"}
