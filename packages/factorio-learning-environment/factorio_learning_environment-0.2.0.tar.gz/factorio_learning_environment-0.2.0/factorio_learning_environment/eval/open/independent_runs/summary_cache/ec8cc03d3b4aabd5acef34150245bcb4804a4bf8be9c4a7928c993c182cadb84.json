{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check and adjust the inserter's position if the furnace is not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters and Drills\n- Regularly refuel inserters and mining drills to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish coal as needed to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Chest Overflow Management\n- Monitor the chest's inventory to prevent overflow. Extract excess iron ore periodically to free up space and avoid mining interruptions.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting. Ensure that the inserter is functioning correctly and that there is a clear path for the ore to be transferred to the furnace."}
