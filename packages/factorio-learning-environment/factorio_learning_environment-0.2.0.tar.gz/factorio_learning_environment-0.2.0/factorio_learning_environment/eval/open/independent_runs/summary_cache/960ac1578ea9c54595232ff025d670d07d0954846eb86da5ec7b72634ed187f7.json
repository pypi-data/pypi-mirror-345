{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron and copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting various positions, primarily empty or not fully operational\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target location for placing an entity is clear of obstructions before attempting to place it. For example, the failed attempt to place a pipe at (-47.5, -120.5) indicates something was in the way.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Verify all necessary connections are established for entities to function correctly. The boiler is not receiving water, indicating a missing or incorrect connection in the pipe network.\n\n### Power Supply Issues\n- Ensure that all electrical components are connected to a power source. The inserter and lab are not receiving electricity, which suggests a gap in the power network or insufficient power supply."}
