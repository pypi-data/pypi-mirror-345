Verify object attributes and methods before use.\n\n### Errors with Belt Connectivity\n- Ensure continuous placement of transport belts without gaps. Check the alignment and connectivity of belts to avoid gaps that disrupt the flow of materials.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check the inventory of source entities to ensure they are not empty.\n\n### Furnace Warnings\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply raw materials to furnaces to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Mining Drill Fuel Shortage\n- Ensure that mining drills have a sufficient supply of fuel to maintain operation. Regularly refuel mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel."}
