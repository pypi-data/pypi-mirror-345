{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for storage\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for storage\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5) and Inserter at Position (x=9.5, y=5.5)\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Electricity Supply\n- Ensure all electric poles are properly connected to the power network to provide electricity to machines and inserters. Check connections at positions such as (x=7.5, y=5.5) and (x=9.5, y=5.5).\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for production processes. For instance, the Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) requires copper plates for copper cable production.\n\n### Errors Due to No Fuel\n- Ensure that boilers and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate. The boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established and that there is a continuous flow of required fluids. The steam engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5) is not receiving input liquid.\n\n### Inserter Placement and Operation Errors\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned and powered to move items between machines and chests. Check inserters at positions (x=7.5, y=5.5) and (x=9.5, y=5.5) for power and source item availability."}
