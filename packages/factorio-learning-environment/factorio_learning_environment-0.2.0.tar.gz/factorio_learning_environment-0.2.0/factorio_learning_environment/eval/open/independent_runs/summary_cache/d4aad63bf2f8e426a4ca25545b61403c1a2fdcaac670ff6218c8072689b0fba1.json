Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (9997 units)\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore (3 units)\n\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Empty\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plates (98 units)\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours:\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-14.5, y=-46.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the mining drill's drop position is emptied regularly to avoid mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Always check the inventory for sufficient coal before attempting to refuel mining drills or other coal-dependent machinery.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt; otherwise, it will not produce any output.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operation\n- Check that the inserter has access to source items to avoid waiting states. Ensure the source chest is not empty and the inserter is correctly aligned with both the source and destination."}
