{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and extracting iron ore from the ground.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore, currently normal status.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which has no ingredients to smelt and is currently not working.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting iron ore from inventory**\n  - Ensure you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. The current inventory shows only wood, which is insufficient for the insertion.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace has no ingredients**\n  - The furnace cannot operate without the required ingredients. Make sure to supply the necessary materials for smelting.\n\n- **Errors related to chest being full**\n  - The wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Empty the chest to allow the burner mining drill to continue mining.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `current_inventory`: dict - Inventory before insertion (e.g., {'wood': 6}).\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict - Inventory of the chest before insertion (e.g., {'iron-ore': 135}).\n  - `nearest_coal_position`: tuple - Position of the nearest coal (e.g., (40.5, -82.5)).\n  - `drill_status`: EntityStatus - Status of the burner mining drill (e.g., EntityStatus.WORKING).\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus - Status of the stone furnace (e.g., EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS)."}
