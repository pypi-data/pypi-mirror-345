{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and is refueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores the extracted iron ore, currently containing 455 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is aligned to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace. It is refueled with coal and is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it currently has no ingredients to smelt and is not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the pickup and drop positions are accurately set and that the inserter is not waiting for source items due to misalignment.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the mining drill and inserter with coal to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that there is enough coal in your inventory for refueling tasks.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that you have the required items in your inventory. For example, ensure you have coal available before trying to refuel entities."}
