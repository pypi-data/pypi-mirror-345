{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) with fuel (coal: 6), connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) (full, inventory: coal: 800)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=54.5, y=-84.5) (inventory: coal: 104)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) (out of fuel), connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) (full, inventory: copper-ore: 800)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) (empty)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) with fuel (coal: 47), producing copper-plate\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with fuel (coal: 45), producing iron-plate\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5), connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) (inventory: iron-plate: 177)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) (empty)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) with fuel (coal: 14), connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) (inventory: iron-ore: 367)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) (inventory: iron-ore: 750, copper-plate: 42)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) (output blocked)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (x=-16.5, y=-69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-16.5, y=-69.5), connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-17.5, y=-69.5) (inventory: iron-plate: 20)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-69.5) (empty)\n\n### Additional Storage Chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) (inventory: iron-plate: 629)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-20.5, y=-63.5) (inventory: iron-plate: 31)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) (inventory: iron-plate: 177)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### NameError: Undefined Entity Class\n- Ensure that all entity classes, such as `BurnerMiningDrill` and `StoneFurnace`, are correctly imported or defined before use.\n\n### TypeError: Incorrect Argument Type in isinstance()\n- When using `isinstance()`, ensure the second argument is a type or a tuple of types. Avoid passing non-type objects like `Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill`.\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting due to lack of space.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Ensure there is a valid sink entity or space available for inserter outputs to avoid blockage warnings and operational delays."}
