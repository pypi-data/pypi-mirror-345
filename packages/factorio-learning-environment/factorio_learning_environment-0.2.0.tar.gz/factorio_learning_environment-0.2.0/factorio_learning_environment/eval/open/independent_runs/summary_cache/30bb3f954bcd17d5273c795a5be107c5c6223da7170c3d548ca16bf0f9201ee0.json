For example, copper-plate is needed to craft copper-cable, which in turn is needed for small-electric-poles.\n- Verify that there is sufficient quantity of each ingredient to meet the crafting requirements.\n\n### Errors in Placing and Connecting Entities\n- Confirm that there is enough inventory of the item you are trying to place. For instance, ensure you have small-electric-poles in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n- Check that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity.\n- Ensure that all components of a structure are properly connected. For example, verify that pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Errors in Extracting and Inserting Items\n- Move close to the target entity before attempting to extract items from it.\n- Ensure that the entity you are extracting from contains the items you wish to extract.\n- Verify that the correct items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors in Electric Network Configuration\n- Ensure all electric poles are properly connected to form a continuous network.\n- Verify that the electricity group is correctly connected to power all necessary components.\n\n### General Connection Errors\n- Double-check connections between different components, such as pipes and electric poles, to ensure they are correctly configured and not left unconnected."}
