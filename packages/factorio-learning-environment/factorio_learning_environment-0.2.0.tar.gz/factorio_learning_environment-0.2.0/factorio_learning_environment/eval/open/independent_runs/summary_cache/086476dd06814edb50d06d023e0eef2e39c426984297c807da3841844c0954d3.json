{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n-------------------\n### Copper Cable Factory Interface at (\u22482.5, 17.5)\nConsists of:\n- Input Chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5) serving as the resource interface.\n- Factory Burner Inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) using direction RIGHT, placed adjacent to the input chest.\n- Additional Factory Burner Inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5) retrieved during connection attempts.\n- Assembling Machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5) intended for copper cable production.\n\n### Wooden Chest Depot Belt Network at (3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of:\n- Belt Depot Wooden Chest at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) crafted and successfully placed to serve as the depot.\n- Transport Belt Segment at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) positioned next to the depot chest.\n- Depot Burner Inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) using direction UP, interfacing with the depot chest via its pickup at (3.5, 15.5).\n\n### Extraction System Interface at (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of:\n- Extraction System Burner Inserter at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5) with drop position Position(x=-3.5, y=28.5).\nUse-case: Provides the source for resource extraction to feed connected structures via transport belts.\n\n### Electricity Generator at (-0.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5) acting as the generator core.\n- Boiler at Position(x=-5.5, y=24.0).\n- Offshore Pump at Position(x=-7.5, y=25.5).\nUse-case: Generates power for the factory setup (currently displaying warnings regarding power network connection and fluid input).\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 Belt Connection Target:\n  \u2013 Multiple steps (210, 211, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217) failed when attempting to connect transport belts because the target was interpreted as a Prototype.SteamEngine object. To resolve this, always use an inserter (with a defined pickup position) as the target for belt connections.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance:\n  \u2013 At Step 212, placement of a wooden chest failed because the target position (3.5, 15.5) was too far from the player\u2019s current location (0, 0). Always ensure the player is within the maximum allowed distance before placing an entity.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Variable Management:\n  \u2013 In Step 213, a wooden chest placement failed due to it not being in inventory and a NameError arising from an undefined variable ('target_chest'). Verify that the required items are available (or craft them when needed) and that all variable names are correctly defined before use."}
