Ensure you have a surplus of materials to avoid interruptions in crafting processes.\n3. **Distance Awareness**: Be mindful of the distance from the player to the target placement location. Move closer to the desired location before attempting to place entities.\n4. **Error Handling**: Implement checks after each action (crafting, placing) to confirm success. This can help identify issues early and allow for corrective actions.\n5. **Documentation of Steps**: Maintain a log of actions taken, including inventory status and crafting attempts.
