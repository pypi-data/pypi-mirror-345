{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and a burner inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n- Stone Furnace 1 at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and Stone Furnace 2 at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5) and outputs from (x=43.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transporting coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. Check if the source entities are operational and have the required items.\n\n### Errors with Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials to maintain continuous operation."}
