{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine, with various pipes and underground pipes at positions such as (x=16.5, y=17.5), (x=17.5, y=17.5), etc.\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 15358, transporting water from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the types of pipes being used are compatible with the entities they are connecting. For instance, the error in connecting 'UndergroundPipe' and 'Pipe' from the boiler to the steam engine suggests a mismatch or incorrect connection attempt.\n- Verify that all required connection points are accessible and that there are no obstructions preventing the connection.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers to prevent them from running out of fuel, as indicated by the \"out of fuel\" warning for the boiler.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities(entity1, entity2, {Prototype.Pipe, Prototype.UndergroundPipe})`: This function attempts to connect two entities using specified pipe prototypes. It failed due to incompatible or incorrect connections between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: List of pipes intended to connect the boiler and steam engine.\n  - `fluid_system`: Identifier for fluid systems, such as 15358 for the water transport system.\n  - `voltage`: Represents the voltage level in the electricity group, currently at 0 indicating no power generation."}
