{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered and mining iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (19.5, 75.5) intended to collect iron plates from the furnace output.\n- Two burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5) intended to move iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n- Small electric pole at (17.5, 69.5) connected to the power network to supply electricity to the mining drill.\n\n### Electricity generator at position near (0.5, 6.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) supplying water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal to convert water to steam.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) generating electricity from steam.\n- Small electric poles near the boiler (at -4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (at 0.5, 3.5) to distribute power.\n\nThe electricity generator powers the electric mining drill and other electric entities through an electricity network connecting poles from the generator to the drill.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inserting items into entities\n- Avoid attempting to insert items into entities that do not accept them or when the entity\u2019s inventory is full.\n- Check entity inventory capacity before inserting items to prevent LuaItemStack insertion exceptions.\n\n### Errors accessing non-existent attributes on electricity groups\n- Do not access `.energy` attribute on ElectricityGroup objects; they do not have this property.\n- Instead, check power availability by querying individual poles or entities that have an energy attribute.\n\n### Errors placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify the target tile is free from other entities.\n- If placement fails due to an occupied tile, try increasing spacing, changing direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n- This error occurred when placing a wooden chest and small electric pole near existing entities.\n\n### Errors placing entities next to others with insufficient spacing\n- When using `place_entity_next_to`, ensure the spacing and direction do not cause overlap with existing entities.\n- Increase spacing or change direction to find a valid placement position.\n\n### Power supply issues to electric mining drill\n- Ensure the power network is fully connected and powered before placing electric mining drills.\n- Confirm that power poles are connected to a power source and that the drill is within the coverage area.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items and throughput issues\n- If inserters are waiting for source items, verify that the source entity (e.g., furnace output) has items available.\n- Check that inserters are correctly positioned and powered to transfer items efficiently.\n- Consider improving smelting or inserter setup if throughput is insufficient.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
