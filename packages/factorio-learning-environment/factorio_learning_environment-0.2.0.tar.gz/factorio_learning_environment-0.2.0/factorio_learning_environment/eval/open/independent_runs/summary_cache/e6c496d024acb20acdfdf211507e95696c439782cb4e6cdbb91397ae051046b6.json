{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the lab\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to the electricity grid\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. For example, attempting to insert copper ore without having it in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Calculations\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined correctly to avoid `NameError`. For example, ensure variables like `copper_cable_needed_for_poles` are defined before using them in calculations.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connection\n- Verify that all entities are correctly connected. For instance, ensure pipes are properly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check your inventory for sufficient coal to refuel boilers and avoid running out of fuel, which can halt production.\n\n### Errors in Entity Status Checks\n- Ensure that entities like the steam engine are correctly set up and working. If an assertion fails, recheck the setup and connections.\n\n### Errors in Lab Setup\n- Make sure the lab is correctly placed and connected to the power grid. Avoid `NameError` by ensuring the lab entity is correctly referenced in the code.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Group Connections\n- Ensure that all pipe groups are correctly connected and that the required items are available to complete the connections."}
