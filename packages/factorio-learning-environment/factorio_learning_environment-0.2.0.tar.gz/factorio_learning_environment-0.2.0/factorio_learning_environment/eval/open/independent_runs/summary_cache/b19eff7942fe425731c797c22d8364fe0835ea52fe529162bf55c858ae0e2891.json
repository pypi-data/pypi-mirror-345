{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report of the existing structures and error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Line at (-2.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-2.0, -76.0) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-1.0, -74.0) smelting iron plates\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, -74.5) moving items from furnace\n- Iron chest at (1.5, -74.5) collecting iron plates\n- Burner inserter at (2.5, -74.5) for output handling\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Line at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) extracting copper ore\n- Iron chest at (-21.5, -74.5) collecting copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-20.5, -74.5) moving items\n- Stone furnace at (-19.0, -74.0) smelting copper plates\n\n### Secondary Processing Line at (3.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (3.0, -73.0)\n- Stone furnace at (5.0, -73.0)\n- Iron chest at (3.5, -71.5) connected to both furnaces\n- Burner inserter at (1.5, -72.5) for input handling\n- Iron chest at (0.5, -72.5) storing iron plates\n- Burner inserter at (6.5, -72.5) for output handling\n- Iron chest at (7.5, -72.5) collecting output\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Ensure mining drills have fuel before operation - the iron ore mining drill at (-2.0, -76.0) is out of fuel\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Multiple furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings. Ensure proper input material flow through inserters\n- Some furnaces have full output storage preventing further operation - implement better output clearing mechanisms\n\n### Entity Placement Optimization\n- When creating processing lines, ensure all components (mining drills, furnaces, inserters, chests) are properly aligned and connected for optimal material flow"}
