{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\n- Lab is currently conducting Automation research and is connected to the electricity network.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with copper ore input and copper plate output\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials before attempting to craft items. Check your inventory for the required quantities of each material.\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes and Electricity\n- Verify that all necessary items are in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like steam engines, boilers, and labs.\n- Ensure that pipes and electric poles are correctly placed and connected to form a continuous network.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Double-check the positions and existence of entities before performing operations on them. Use the correct entity names and ensure they are present on the map.\n\n### NameError in Code\n- Ensure all variables and constants are defined before use. Double-check for typos or undefined variables in your code.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that all systems are correctly set up and operational before asserting their status. Check connections and fuel levels to avoid assertion failures.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Boilers\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and ensure a steady supply of coal to keep them operational."}
