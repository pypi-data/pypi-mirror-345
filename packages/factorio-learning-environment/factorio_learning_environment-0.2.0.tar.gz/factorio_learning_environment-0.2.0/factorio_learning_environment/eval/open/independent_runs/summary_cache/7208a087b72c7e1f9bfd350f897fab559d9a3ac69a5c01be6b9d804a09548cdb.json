{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), connected to:\n  - **Pipe-to-Ground** at position (x=16.5, y=17.5)\n  - **Pipe** at position (x=17.5, y=17.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), fueled with coal, connected to:\n  - **Pipe** at position (x=1.5, y=21.5) for steam output\n  - Additional pipes connecting to various positions for water input and steam output\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), providing water, connected to:\n  - **Pipe** at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n  - **Pipe** at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for steam, connecting various positions from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for water, connecting various positions from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles at multiple positions, providing voltage across the system\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the connection points for pipes are correctly aligned and within reach of each other. The error \"Failed to connect {'Pipe'} from pipe at x=1.5 y=21.5 to steam-engine at x=17.5 y=20.5\" indicates a misalignment or incorrect positioning of pipes. Verify the positions and adjust as necessary to establish a proper connection."}
