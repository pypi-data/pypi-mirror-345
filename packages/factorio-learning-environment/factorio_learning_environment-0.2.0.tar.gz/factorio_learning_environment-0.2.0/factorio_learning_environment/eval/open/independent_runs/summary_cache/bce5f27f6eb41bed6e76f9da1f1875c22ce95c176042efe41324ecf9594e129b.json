{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (0,0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at position (0,0) with coal fuel and iron plate output\n- Stone furnace at position (2,0) with coal fuel and iron plate output\n\n### Copper Smelting Area at (4,4)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (4,4) with coal fuel and copper plate output\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5,24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-7.0,24.5) containing water and steam\n- Steam engine at position (-2.5,24.5)\n- Two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes connecting pump to boiler at positions (-9.5,23.5), (-8.5,23.5), (-8.5,22.5), (-7.5,22.5)\n  - Steam pipe at position (-5.5,24.5) connecting boiler to steam engine\n\n### Research Area\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position not specified) containing automation science packs\n- Electric pole network with poles at positions (4.5,8.5), (4.5,20.5), (0.5,24.5), (4.5,12.5), (4.5,16.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to insert into furnaces\n- Check inventory for required items before placing entities\n- Raw resources like wood cannot be crafted and must be gathered from the environment\n\n### Recipe and Technology Requirements\n- Research required technologies before attempting to craft items (e.g., Automation technology needed for assembling machine)\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available for complex recipes\n- Some items require specific crafting facilities (furnace or assembling machine)\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Cannot mix different ore types in the same furnace (e.g., cannot insert copper ore into furnace containing iron ore)\n\n### Entity Placement and Connection Errors\n- Ensure you have all required items in inventory before attempting to connect entities with pipes or power poles\n- Verify you have the necessary connecting items (pipes, power poles) before attempting to build power or fluid networks\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Labs and other machines require proper power connection to function\n- Ensure complete power infrastructure (poles connected to power source) before expecting machines to work"}
