Persistent placement issues suggest checking for global restrictions or occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors related to crafting\n- Crafting iron plates requires a smelting process in a furnace. Ensure you have a furnace set up before attempting to craft iron plates.\n\n### Validation errors during entity placement\n- Ensure that the dimensions and attributes of entities being placed are valid integers. Refer to the error documentation for guidance on correcting these issues.\n\n### Inventory management during crafting\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities.
