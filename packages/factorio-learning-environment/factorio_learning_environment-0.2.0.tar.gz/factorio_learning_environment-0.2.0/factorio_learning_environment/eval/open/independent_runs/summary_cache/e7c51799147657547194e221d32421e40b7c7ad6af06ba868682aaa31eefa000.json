{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis structure is designed to transfer iron ore from a chest to a furnace for smelting.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Contains iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Currently, it is misaligned and not functioning correctly.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage System\nThis system is responsible for mining iron ore and storing it in a chest.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and is currently out of fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores the mined iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. The pickup position should be the same as the chest's position to function correctly.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position to ensure proper transfer of materials.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel. Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel these entities.\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Double-check the setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly configured to transfer items from the source to the destination. Misalignment can cause the system to halt, leading to inefficiencies in production.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve the efficiency and functionality of the structures on the map."}
