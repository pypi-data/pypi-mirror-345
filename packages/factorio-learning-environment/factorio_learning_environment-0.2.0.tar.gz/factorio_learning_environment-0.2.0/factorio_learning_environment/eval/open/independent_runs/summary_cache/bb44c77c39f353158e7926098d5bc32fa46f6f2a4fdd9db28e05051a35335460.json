The agent made several attempts to establish a Laboratory at position (0.5, 2.5) to supply Automation Science Packs for research, but none of these efforts succeeded due to inventory and production shortfalls. Although queries were made for available smelting furnaces (one noted at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron ore processing and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper ore smelting), these were pre\u2010existing entities and were not constructed by the agent during these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n  - When using get_entities, avoid supplying unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional parameters. Verify the function\u2019s signature and pass only the supported arguments.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Placement and Crafting Failures\n  - Ensure that a Lab or its required components are present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  - Before iterating over retrieved entities (e.g. filtering labs), check for a None value to prevent TypeError.\n  - Confirm that all sub-ingredients in the Lab crafting process are both available and producible. Address shortages in items such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper-cables by ensuring that intermediate production (including smelting and smaller craft recipes) is fully operational.\n\n\u2022 Resource Chain Verification\n  - Monitor and secure sufficient resources throughout the multi-step crafting chain. This includes verifying that prerequisite raw materials (like iron-plates and copper-plates) can be consistently smelted, so that later ingredients needed for complex items are not missing.\n\n"}
