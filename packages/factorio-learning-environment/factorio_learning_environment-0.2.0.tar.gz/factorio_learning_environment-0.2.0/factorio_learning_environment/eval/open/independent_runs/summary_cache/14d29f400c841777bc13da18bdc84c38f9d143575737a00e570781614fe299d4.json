{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully built on the map. Multiple recovery attempts to supply Automation Science Packs involved trying to locate, craft, and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but none reached completion due to inventory shortages and resource chain issues. While the agent interacted with existing resource\u2010processing facilities (an alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) for iron smelting and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper plate production), these were not constructed as part of the current execution steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Misuse \u2013 When invoking get_entities, use the correct function signature. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments to prevent type errors.\n\u2022 Null Iteration Handling \u2013 Verify that results from functions (e.g., get_entities) are not None before iterating over them. Use a fallback (empty list) to ensure safe processing.\n\u2022 Inventory Verification for Placement \u2013 Confirm that the inventory contains the required Lab before attempting to place it. This precheck helps avoid placement errors caused by missing items.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortfalls \u2013 Ensure that all intermediate ingredients required for Lab crafting\u2014such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables\u2014are sufficiently available. Validate the full dependency chain (including smelted iron and copper plates) and confirm that auxiliary production facilities are operational.\n\u2022 Recipe Dependency Management \u2013 Review the crafting recipes and resource throughput so that shortages (for instance, missing iron-gear-wheels or insufficient copper products) do not block complex crafting processes."}
