{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row with wooden chests:\n- Mining drill at (-10, -59) outputting to chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-8, -59) outputting to chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Mining drill at (-6, -59) outputting to chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are currently out of fuel but positioned over iron ore deposits.\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-28.5, -58.5) \n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59)\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing processed plates\n- Additional burner inserter at (-24.5, -57.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nFour parallel smelting lines, each consisting of:\n- Stone furnace (at 0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0)\n- Input inserters and chests above furnaces\n- Output inserters and chests below furnaces\n- Input chests at (-0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), (6.5,2.5)\n\n### Additional Smelting Setup at (-23, -58)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-23, -58) and (-21, -58)\n- Multiple burner inserters for input/output\n- Wooden chest at (-22.5, -55.5) for output collection\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place entities (transport belt placement failed due to missing inventory items)\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Mining drills are non-functional due to lack of fuel - ensure coal is supplied to keep operations running\n- Several furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - establish proper input material flow\n\n### Structure Optimization Notes\n- Multiple inserters show \"waiting for source items\" status - review and optimize material flow chains\n- Some output is blocked by items on ground - ensure proper item collection mechanisms are in place"}
