{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) and another at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) with a wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5)\n- Transport belts connecting various components, including positions (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-46.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Coal-Powered Electricity Generator\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and offshore pump\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Belt Group connecting various positions for item transportation, including (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. Check the supply chain leading to the inserters to ensure items are being delivered correctly.\n\n### Inserter Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity or storage available to accept the output from inserters. This can prevent blockages and ensure smooth operation.\n\n### No Iron Plates Available for Extraction\n- Check the production line to ensure that iron plates are being produced and transported to the required destination. This may involve checking furnaces and transport belts for any blockages or inefficiencies.\n\n### Error When Inserting Items\n- Ensure that there is enough inventory of the item you are trying to insert. For instance, ensure coal is available in the inventory before attempting to insert it into the boiler."}
