{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Storage Facility\n- **Location:** Position (40.5, -83.5)\n- **Components:**\n  - Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, connected to a transport belt and the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Location:** Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- **Components:**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, processing iron ore.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n  - Transport Belt connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) facilitating movement of items.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\n- **Location:** Position (10.0, 0.0)\n- **Components:**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, processing copper ore.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) transferring copper plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) for storing copper plates.\n\n### Iron and Copper Plate Storage\n- **Location:** Position (7.5, 0.5)\n- **Components:**\n  - Wooden Chest at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron and copper plates.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (6.5, 0.5) waiting for source items to transfer to the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing wooden chests\n- Ensure the target position for placing a wooden chest is not occupied by another entity or is invalid. Check for obstructions or invalid tiles before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent entities\n- Verify the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to extract items. Ensure the coordinates are accurate and the entity exists.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to prevent idle inserters.\n\n### Errors when extracting coal from a chest\n- Confirm that the wooden chest contains the specified item before attempting extraction. Double-check the entity's inventory and position to avoid extraction errors."}
