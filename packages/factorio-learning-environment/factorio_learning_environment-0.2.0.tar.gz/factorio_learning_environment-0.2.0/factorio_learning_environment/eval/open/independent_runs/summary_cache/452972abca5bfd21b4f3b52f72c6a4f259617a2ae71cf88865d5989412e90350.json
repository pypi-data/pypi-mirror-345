Verify the contents before attempting extraction.\n\n#### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if a collision is detected with existing entities.\n- When placing entities next to others, ensure there is adequate space and no obstructions. Consider changing the direction or increasing spacing to avoid conflicts with nearby entities.\n\n#### Errors in Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly check and refill the furnace with required materials to maintain production efficiency."}
