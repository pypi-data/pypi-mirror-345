{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with a status of full output, containing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (-21.0, y=-62.0) with a status of full output, containing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt system.\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) containing copper ore.\n- Transport belt system connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) containing iron ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore to another chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) containing iron ore.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) containing coal.\n- Various belt groups facilitating transport between different entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure that the entity type and position are correctly specified when using the `get_entity` function. Double-check the position and ensure the entity exists at that location before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors with inserter operations\n- Verify that the inserter's source and destination are correctly set up and that there are items available at the source for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting for source items, ensure the source entity is correctly supplying items.\n\n### Errors with full output status\n- Regularly check the output status of furnaces and ensure there is a mechanism to clear the output to avoid production halts. Consider using inserters to transfer items from furnaces to chests or belts to maintain continuous production."}
