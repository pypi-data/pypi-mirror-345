{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the structures and providing error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Setup at (-82, 41)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt at (41.5, -80.5) oriented RIGHT\n- Stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0) oriented UP\n\nThe structure appears to be a coal mining setup with a transport system, though it's currently experiencing issues with blocked belts and positioning.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is free from other entities\n- Ensure the target location is on valid terrain (not water)\n- When placing inserters, verify both pickup and drop positions are accessible\n\n### Belt Management\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to place new entities around them\n- Ensure there is proper item flow by having functional input/output connections\n\n### Inserter Positioning\n- When placing inserters between belts and machines, ensure:\n  - The inserter can reach both pickup and drop positions\n  - The inserter's orientation matches the intended item flow\n  - There is enough space for the inserter to operate\n\n### Structure Design\n- Plan the layout considering the working dimensions of all entities\n- Leave adequate space between entities for inserters and belts\n- Consider the direction of item flow when placing entities\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `belt`: TransportBelt - Used for item transport\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter - Used for moving items between entities\n- `vertical_belt`: TransportBelt - Attempted usage for vertical transport\n- `furnace`: Furnace - Used for smelting operations\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill - Used for resource extraction\n\n### Entity States\n- Mining drill status: WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- Belt status: WORKING but blocked\n- Furnace status: NO_INGREDIENTS with full fuel\n- Inserter status (when placed): WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION"}
