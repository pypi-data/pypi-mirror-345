Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest, Burner inserter\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore, Iron plate\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron ore\n  - Furnace Result: Empty\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest, Burner mining drill, Stone furnace\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of resources, leading to production halts.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and clear out full inventories, especially in chests, to prevent production bottlenecks. Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the mining drill is emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of fuel (coal) for all entities that require it, such as mining drills, furnaces, and inserters. Running out of fuel will stop production processes.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is consistently supplied with both fuel and raw materials (iron ore) to maintain continuous production of iron plates."}
