{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (41.5, -80.5)) containing 56 units of coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) fueled with 4 units of coal. It is currently working and has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5).\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15, -50)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (-15, -50)) with a fuel inventory containing 50 units of coal and a result inventory containing 100 units of iron plates. The furnace is currently not processing due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure you are at the correct entity (e.g., wooden chest) before attempting to extract items. Multiple attempts to extract coal from the wooden chest resulted in failure due to incorrect positioning or state.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Check the inventory capacity of the target entity (e.g., stone furnace) before attempting to insert items. The furnace was unable to accept coal as it was full, leading to multiple failed insert attempts.\n\n### Errors when refueling\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill has a valid drop position that is not full before attempting to refuel. The drill reported that the chest at the drop position is full, which prevents further mining.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item`: Used to extract items from entities. Failed multiple times due to incorrect positioning or state of the entity.\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Failed multiple times due to full inventories.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `wooden_chest`: type `Chest`, assigned at position (41.5, -80.5).\n- `burner_mining_drill`: type `BurnerMiningDrill`, assigned at position (41.0, -82.0).\n- `furnace`: type `Furnace`, assigned at position (-15, -50).\n- `coal`: type `Inventory`, with varying counts in different entities."}
