{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5), connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (-13.0, -48.0) with a connected chest at (-13.5, -49.5).\n  - (-11.0, -48.0) with a connected chest at (-12.5, -49.5).\n  - (-9.0, -48.0) with a connected chest at (-9.5, -49.5).\n- **Iron Chests** at positions:\n  - (-18.5, -48.5) containing iron ore.\n  - (-16.5, -48.5) containing iron ore.\n  - (-15.5, -48.5) empty.\n  - (-14.5, -47.5) empty.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -78.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chests** at positions:\n  - (41.5, -80.5) empty.\n  - (42.5, -80.5) containing iron plates and coal.\n  - (44.5, -80.5) containing iron plates and coal.\n  - (45.5, -80.5) containing iron plates and coal.\n  - (47.5, -80.5) containing coal.\n  - (49.5, -80.5) containing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) containing coal.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions:\n  - (43.5, -80.5) transferring between chests and furnaces.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the supply chain connected to the inserter at position (41.5, -78.5) is complete and that source items are available for the inserter to function.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full, such as the one at (-14.5, -48.5), to prevent mining operations from halting.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain to ensure that iron ore is being delivered to the furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0).\n\n### Refueling Burner Mining Drills\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to maintain continuous operation, as seen with the drill at (-15.0, -50.0).\n\n### Connected Chest with Coal\n- Verify that connected chests with coal are properly linked to inserters and other machines to ensure smooth operation, as indicated by the repeated message \"Connected chest has coal, inserter should be working.\""}
