{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5), connected to a Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0).\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer items to the Stone Furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5), connected to a Wooden Chest and a Stone Furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Additional Stone Furnaces at positions (-11.0, -48.0) and (-9.0, -48.0) currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer items to the Stone Furnace.\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5) connected to the Burner Inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) waiting for source items, connected to another Burner Inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source from which the inserters are supposed to pick items is adequately stocked. This will prevent the inserters from idling and improve efficiency.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests Preventing Mining\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are used as drop positions for mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting resource extraction.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are consistently supplied with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production. This can involve setting up more efficient logistics or ensuring a steady supply of raw materials."}
