{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, y=-113.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Collection at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill and Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) for iron plate collection\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -122.5) with water fluid system\n- Multiple other PipeGroups at various positions for fluid management\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs but no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a wooden chest without having one in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Output Inventory\n- Regularly check and empty chests or other output inventories to prevent blockages in production lines. For instance, the burner mining drill was blocked because the chest at the drop position was full.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in entities like boilers and furnaces to avoid interruptions. The boiler was out of fuel, which can halt energy production."}
