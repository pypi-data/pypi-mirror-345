For example, instead of using buildable_area.center() (which triggers a TypeError), access the center attribute correctly or call the proper method.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate function parameters and ensure correct order and type to prevent similar type errors.\n\n\u2022 Pre-Placement Verification:\n\u2003\u2013 Systematically use can_place_entity to confirm candidate viability before proceeding with placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure environmental checks and alignment conditions (such as for pipe endpoints or electrical connections) are thoroughly performed prior to action.\n\n\u2022 General API Misuse:\n\u2003\u2013 When invoking entity-related functions (for example, those handling pickup and insertion), verify that all arguments (including Position objects) are correctly referenced and ordered to avoid misplacement and operational inconsistencies."}
