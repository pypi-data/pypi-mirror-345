{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Steam Engine at position (-13.5, 23.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Pipe Group at position (-9.5, 23.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at positions (-4.5, 16.5), (-10.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 24.5), (-4.5, 24.5) - Status: EMPTY\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group at position (-3.67, 20.21) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before attempting to place a pipe-to-ground. Errors occurred when trying to place pipes at positions such as (-11.0, 23.5) and (-11.5, 25.0) due to overlapping with existing objects or water.\n- Check inventory for available pipes before attempting to place them. Errors occurred when trying to place pipes without having them in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connection\n- Verify the connection path between pipe-to-ground entities is clear and valid before attempting to connect them. Errors occurred when attempting to connect pipes at positions such as (-9.5, 23.5) to (-10.5, 23.5) and (-9.5, 23.5) to (-7.5, 23.5).\n\n### Errors with Electricity Network\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity network are properly connected. The electricity group at position (-3.67, 20.21) is not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Errors with Stone Furnace\n- Provide necessary ingredients to the stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) to avoid the NO_INGREDIENTS status."}
