{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with key positions including (x=1.5, y=21.5), (x=17.5, y=20.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (x=9.5, y=15.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=6.5, y=21.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, transporting water\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=7.5, y=8.5), and (x=1.5, y=2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into the boiler without having coal in the inventory resulted in failure.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that the positions and connections between pipes and entities are correct. Multiple attempts to connect pipes from position (x=1.5, y=21.5) to the steam engine at (x=17.5, y=20.5) failed. Ensure that the entities are correctly aligned and compatible for connection.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(Position, Position, {Prototype})`: Attempts to connect two positions using specified prototypes. Failed due to incorrect alignment or incompatible entities.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of connected pipe entities, type: List[Entity]\n- `inventory`: Current inventory state, type: Dict[str, int]"}
