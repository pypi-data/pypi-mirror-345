{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore and smelt it into iron plates.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=28.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=28.0, y=86.0)\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=30.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=30.0, y=86.0)\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=32.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=32.0, y=86.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fueling Failures and Logic Errors\n*   The agent repeatedly failed to fuel existing burner mining drills and stone furnaces across multiple steps (32-46).\n*   Steps 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, and 46 consistently showed assertion errors related to entity count mismatches after the fueling attempt (`AssertionError: Logic error: Entity count mismatch. Handled: 0, Failed: 0, Total Found: 6`). This indicates a persistent flaw in the fueling logic where the function identifies the entities correctly but fails to process or track the fueling status for any of them, leading to the assertion failure. The fueling process itself seems to be skipped or exited prematurely within the logic."}
