{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-1.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine with various pipe positions\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5)\n\n### Research Lab Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (2.5, 0.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (1.5, 2.5), (1.5, 14.5), (1.5, 6.5), (1.5, 10.5), and (3.5, 20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Initiating Research\n- Ensure that the lab is properly connected to a power source and has the necessary science packs to initiate research.\n\n### Inserter Configuration Errors\n- Verify that inserters have a valid source and destination. Ensure that the source contains the necessary items for the inserter to pick up, and that the destination has space to accept items.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Source Items\n- Check that the source inventory for inserters is not empty and contains the required items for the inserters to function properly.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Destination Space\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not full and can accept additional items. If necessary, clear space in the destination or redirect the output to a different location.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Supply\n- Make sure that the boiler and other fuel-dependent entities have a sufficient supply of fuel to operate continuously.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Operation\n- If the steam engine is not working, verify that the boiler is producing steam and that the steam engine is properly connected to the power grid. Check for any blockages or disconnections in the pipe system.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check the inventory to ensure that there are sufficient resources available for crafting and supplying to entities."}
