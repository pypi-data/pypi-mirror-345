{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0, 0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a result inventory containing 100 copper plates. The furnace is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) with an inventory containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when crafting Automation Science Pack**\n  - Ensure that you have enough copper plates available in your inventory before attempting to craft the Automation Science Pack. The recipe requires 1 copper plate, which must be available either in your inventory or produced by a furnace.\n  \n- **Errors when transferring copper plates**\n  - Ensure that you have copper plates in your inventory before attempting to transfer them to the chest. If your inventory is empty, the transfer will fail.\n\n- **Errors when furnace is not smelting**\n  - Check that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. If it is showing \"no ingredients to smelt,\" make sure to provide the required raw materials.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to insufficient resources (copper plates) required for crafting.\n  \n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `copper_plate`: int (amount of copper plates in inventory)\n  - `stone_furnace`: object (instance of stone furnace)\n  - `wooden_chest`: object (instance of wooden chest)\n  - `automation_science_pack`: int (amount of automation science packs in inventory)"}
