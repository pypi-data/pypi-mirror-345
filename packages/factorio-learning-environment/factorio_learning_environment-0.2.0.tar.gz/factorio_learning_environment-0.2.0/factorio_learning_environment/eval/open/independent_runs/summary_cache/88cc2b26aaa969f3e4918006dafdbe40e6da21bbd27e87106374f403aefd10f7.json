{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working but has a warning: \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\"\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n- Additional **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) with normal status and empty inventories.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently working with iron ore as the source and producing iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently working with iron ore as the source and producing iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently not working due to \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) with varying inventories of iron plates. Some chests have warnings indicating they are full.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) with iron plates stored.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Regularly check and clear out full chests to prevent interruptions in mining and production processes.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Keep track of ingredient levels in furnaces to ensure continuous production. Replenish ingredients as needed to avoid production halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: Represents a furnace entity, used in item insertion operations.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary tracking the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wood', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
