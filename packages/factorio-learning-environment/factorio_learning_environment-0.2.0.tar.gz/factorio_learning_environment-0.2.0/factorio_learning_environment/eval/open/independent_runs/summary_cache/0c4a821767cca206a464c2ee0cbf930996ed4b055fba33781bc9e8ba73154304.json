{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production (Position 0,0 and 2,0)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing iron plates:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0) with coal fuel (16), processing iron ore (8) into iron plates (2)\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) with coal fuel (17), processing iron ore (8) into iron plates (2)\nBoth furnaces are actively working\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position 4,4 and 6,4)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing copper plates:\n- Furnace 3 at (4,4) with coal fuel (22), processing copper ore (9) into copper plates (2)\n- Furnace 4 at (6,4) with coal fuel (23), processing copper ore (9) into copper plates (2)\nBoth furnaces are actively working\n\n### Power Generation System (Position -7.5, 18.5)\nComplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Steam engine at (-7.5, 18.5), working status, containing 200 steam at 165\u00b0\n- Boiler at (-7.5, 22.0), currently out of fuel, containing water (200) and steam (153)\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5), working status, containing water (100)\n- Connected pipe groups:\n  - Steam pipes at (-7.5, 15.5)\n  - Empty pipes at (-7.5, 20.5)\n  - Water pipes at (-8.5, 23.5)\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nExtensive power pole network operating at 996kV, connecting multiple areas including:\n- Poles at (7.5, 7.5), (-4.5, 9.5), (7.5, 17.5)\n- Additional poles at (3.5, 6.5), (3.5, 7.5), (4.5, 7.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Research and Technology Issues\n- Use correct technology names: 'logistic-science-pack' instead of 'LogisticSciencePack'\n- Verify technology prerequisites before researching (Logistics 2 and Electric Energy Distribution require logistic science packs)\n- Cannot research advanced technologies without required prerequisites\n\n### Lab Location and Access Issues\n- Lab positions are not being found correctly - verify lab coordinates before attempting access\n- Ensure lab search area matches actual lab placement\n- Implement better lab discovery mechanism as current search is not finding any labs\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler - currently running out of fuel\n- Keep track of coal in inventory before attempting to insert into boiler\n- Maintain consistent fuel supply to prevent power generation interruptions\n\n### Entity Access Errors\n- Verify entity existence before attempting to access or modify\n- Check for correct entity positioning when searching for specific entities\n- Use correct prototype naming and entity references\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Use correct prototype names when accessing recipes and entities\n- Handle missing entities gracefully when searching or accessing\n- Verify entity existence before attempting operations"}
