{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (5.0, -73.0))\n\n### Electricity generator at position (-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position (-18.5, 19.5))\n- Boiler (position (-13.5, 20.0))\n- Offshore pump (position (-11.5, 26.5))\n- Small electric poles (positions (-16.5, 19.5), (-16.5, 20.5), (-16.5, 21.5), (-15.5, 19.5), (-19.5, 22.5))\n\n### Lab at position (-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (-17.5, 23.5))\n\n### Assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position (-21.5, 25.5))\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 41235, position (-18.5, 16.5))\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 41238, position (-12.5, 21.5))\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 41241, position (-9.5, 21.5))\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 41246, position (-10.5, 22.5))\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 41247, position (-6.5, 23.5))\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup (id 213281, poles at positions (-16.5, 20.5), (-16.5, 19.5), (-16.5, 21.5), (-16.5, 18.5), (-15.5, 20.5), (-19.5, 22.5))\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract items from entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the item you wish to extract. In this case, the stone furnace at (5.0, -73.0) did not contain copper plates.\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of objects\n- Verify that the object you are trying to access has the attribute you are referencing. The error with the `ElectricityGroup` indicates that the `electrical_id` attribute does not exist. Check the object structure to confirm available attributes before usage."}
