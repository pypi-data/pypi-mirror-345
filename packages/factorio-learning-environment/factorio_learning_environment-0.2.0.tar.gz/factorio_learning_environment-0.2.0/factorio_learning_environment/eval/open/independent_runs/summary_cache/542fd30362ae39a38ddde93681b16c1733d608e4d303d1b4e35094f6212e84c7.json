{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore, currently containing 725 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. Currently out of fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues and lacks ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Placement\n- Ensure there is enough space and correct direction when placing an inserter. Avoid placing inserters where they might collide with existing entities or on unsuitable terrain (e.g., water). Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fueling\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to ensure they can operate continuously. An inserter without fuel will not transfer items, leading to production halts.\n\n### Errors with Resource Transfer\n- Verify the alignment and functionality of inserters to ensure resources are being transferred correctly from chests to furnaces. Misalignment or lack of fuel can cause resources not to reach their intended destination, halting production processes."}
