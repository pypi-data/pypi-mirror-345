{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the processed iron plates.\nUpdates:\n- Steps 38\u201347: Produced and extracted multiple batches of iron plates; experienced a temporary halt due to insufficient iron ore.\n- Steps 48\u201349: Inserted additional iron ore resulting in an inventory update showing 14 iron ore remaining, 5 iron plates processed, and 25 coal used as fuel.\n- Step 51: Insertion of 10 additional iron ore updated the furnace inventory to 7 iron ore and 15 iron plates after processing.\n- Step 52: Extracted 10 iron plates, updating the furnace inventory to 13 iron plates.\n- Steps 54\u201355: Harvested 10 iron ore and inserted into the furnace; subsequent processing attempts resulted in consecutive timeouts with the furnace inventory eventually showing 22 iron plates and repeated timeout errors.\n- Step 56: Extracted 22 iron plates from the furnace, further updating connected inventories.\n- Step 58: Harvested 10 iron ore from a resource at position (-15.5, -50.5), adding to player inventory.\n- Step 59: Moved to the furnace, inserted 5 coal as fuel and 10 iron ore for smelting; observed processing over 5 seconds until the furnace produced 10 iron plates which were then extracted and updated in the inventory.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Timeout errors during smelting process\n- Avoid repeated waiting iterations without verifying that fuel and ingredients are consistently supplied. Investigate furnace conditions when production stalls.\n\n### Insufficient resource availability and inventory mismanagement\n- Confirm resource quantities before insertions into processing structures to prevent intermittent halts.\n\n### Processing timing and ingredient replenishment delays\n- Align wait intervals with expected processing cycles and monitor ingredient levels to ensure smooth operation.\n\n### Stale entity status data usage\n- Regularly refresh entity data to ensure decisions are based on the current state of the map, particularly during critical processing stages.\n\n### Repeated stale map data display errors\n- Ensure that API calls provide current entity information, especially after inventory updates, to avoid reliance on outdated map snapshots."}
