{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created by the agent in the given steps.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing wooden chests\n- Ensure that the target placement position for wooden chests is free of obstructions. The agent repeatedly attempted to place chests at various positions (e.g., x=2.5 y=1.5, x=4.5 y=1.5, etc.) but encountered obstructions or stale entity data, preventing successful placement.\n\n### Incorrect use of API\n- When using the `center()` method, ensure that it is called correctly. A `TypeError` occurred due to attempting to call a `Position` object as a function. Verify that the method is used as intended and that the object supports the operation.\n\n### Errors in building box dimensions\n- When defining dimensions for building boxes, ensure that the values are of the correct type. An error was encountered due to incorrect type usage in the building box dimensions for a wooden chest. Refer to the documentation to ensure compatibility with expected data types.\n\n### Lack of resources\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore available for operations. The agent attempted to supply furnaces with iron ore but found none available in the inventory. Regularly check resource levels and plan resource gathering accordingly."}
