{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is connected to a wooden chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) which stores mined iron ore.\n- **Furnaces** at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0). These furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Each furnace has been noted to have no ingredients to smelt, indicating a potential supply issue.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), (x=4.5, y=-58.5), (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), (x=-12.5, y=-50.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5).\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) and (x=-5.5, y=-50.5). These chests store various resources including iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage. The chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) is full, which has stopped the mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain smelting operations. The furnaces at (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) are currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the logs provided.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the final inventory state with quantities of various items like wood, coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels."}
