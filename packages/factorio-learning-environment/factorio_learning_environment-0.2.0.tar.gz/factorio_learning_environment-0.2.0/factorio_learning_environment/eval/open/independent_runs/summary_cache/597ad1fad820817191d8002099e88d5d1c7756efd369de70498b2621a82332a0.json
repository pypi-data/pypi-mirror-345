{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 3.0)\n- Steam engine at (1.5, 7.5)\n- Connected with pipes forming a water and steam network\n- Currently working but boiler is out of fuel\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5)\n- Wooden chest at (17.5, 70.5) for collecting iron ore\n- Inserter at (19.5, 70.5) (not connected to power)\n- Electric furnace at (21.5, 76.5) (not connected to the mining drill)\n- Mining drill is working but chest is full\n\n### Second Iron Mining Operation at (18.5, 78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (18.5, 78.5)\n- Wooden chest at (18.5, 76.5) for collecting iron ore\n- Mining drill is working but chest is full\n\n### Copper Mining Operation at (-47.5, 78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (-47.5, 78.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-47.5, 76.5) for collecting copper ore\n- Electric furnace at (-43.5, 79.5) (not connected to the mining drill)\n- Mining drill is working but chest is full\n\n### Storage Area\n- Wooden chest at (0.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Make sure to move closer to the target location before placing entities\n- The maximum placement distance is 10 units from the player's position\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid terrain\n- Check if the target position is already occupied by another entity or is unplaceable terrain (like water)\n- Use the entity data to identify nearby entities that might be blocking placement\n\n### Errors when connecting entities that are too far apart\n- When using connect_entities to connect with transport belts, ensure the entities are close enough\n- Consider using underground belts for longer distances or when direct paths are blocked\n\n### Errors with mining drill output\n- Mining drills have stopped due to full chests - implement a system to empty chests or connect them to processing\n- Connect inserters to power network to move items from chests to furnaces\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Some entities (like the inserter at 19.5, 70.5) are not connected to the power network\n- Ensure all electrical entities are within range of electric poles"}
