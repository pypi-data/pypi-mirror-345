{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel but no ingredients\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with fuel but no ingredients\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0) with fuel but no ingredients\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5) connected to a series of pipes\n- PipeGroup at position (4.5, -9.5) with water output\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (24.5, -7.5), (22.5, -4.5), and (x=-2.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at position (-3.5, 1.5) connected to the electricity network but not receiving power\n\n### Storage and Transfer\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position (-3.5, 1.5) transferring items from the chest\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly placed and connected to the intended entities. Double-check the positions before attempting to pick up or connect pipes.\n\n### Boiler Water Supply Issues\n- Verify that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. Ensure that all pipe connections are intact and that the offshore pump is operational.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply Issues\n- Make sure all inserters are within range of a powered electric pole. Check that the electricity network is complete and that poles are connected to a power source."}
