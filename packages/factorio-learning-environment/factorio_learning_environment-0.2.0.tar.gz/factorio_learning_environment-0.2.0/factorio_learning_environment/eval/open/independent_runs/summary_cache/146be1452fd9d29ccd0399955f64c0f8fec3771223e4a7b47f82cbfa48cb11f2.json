{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System at Position (x=52.5, y=-84.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=54.5, y=-84.5) for additional coal storage.\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal and transferring to the chest at (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Iron ore is transferred to the furnace from the inventory.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transfer System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting various positions for ore movement.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transfer System at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring ore between chests.\n- Transport belts facilitating ore movement.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System at Position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-15.5, y=-64.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Additional Storage and Transfer Systems\n- Various wooden chests at positions (x=-17.5, y=-69.5), (x=-15.5, y=-69.5), (x=-24.5, y=-67.5), (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), (x=-12.5, y=-54.5), (x=-13.5, y=-61.5), (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), (x=-12.5, y=-54.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=3.5, y=0.5) for various resources.\n- Multiple belt groups connecting different sections for efficient resource movement.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source container has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source chest and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Errors with Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly check the output inventory of furnaces to ensure they are not full. Transfer items out of the furnace to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply the required resources to maintain production.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Full Chests\n- Avoid placing inserters to transfer items into full chests. Regularly clear out the inventory of chests to ensure smooth operation."}
