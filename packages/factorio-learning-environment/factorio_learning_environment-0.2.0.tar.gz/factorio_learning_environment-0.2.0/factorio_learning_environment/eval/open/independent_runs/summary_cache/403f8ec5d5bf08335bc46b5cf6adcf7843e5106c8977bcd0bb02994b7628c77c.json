{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (x=0.5, y=2.5)\nConnected by pipes and power poles (working, producing 6150.0 power)\n\n#### Oil Processing Facility\n1. Crude Oil Extraction:\n   - Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) [working, connected to power]\n   - Connected to crude oil input tank (x=4.5, y=15.5)\n\n2. Oil Refinery:\n   - Oil refinery (x=9.5, y=15.5) set to Basic Oil Processing [FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE]\n   - Connected to:\n     - Crude oil input tank (x=4.5, y=15.5)\n     - Petroleum gas output tank (x=14.5, y=30.5) [newly placed]\n\n3. Chemical Processing:\n   - Chemical plant (x=2.5, y=8.5) set to Sulfur recipe [FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE]\n   - Connected to:\n     - Water input (connected)\n     - Petroleum gas input (not connected properly)\n     - Sulfur output tank (x=6.5, y=8.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Entity Placement Issues\n- Repeated failures placing petroleum gas tank at multiple positions (14.5,15.5), (14.5,18.5), (14.5,20.5), (14.5,25.5)\n  - Verify position is on land and not blocked before attempting placement\n  - Use map preview to check terrain before placement attempts\n  - Successful placement finally achieved at (14.5,30.5)\n\n#### Fluid Connection Problems\n- Cannot connect empty fluid sources to processing buildings (oil refinery, chemical plant)\n  - Ensure source tanks have fluid before making connections\n  - Verify fluid types match between connected entities\n  - Check pipe connections are complete before expecting fluid flow\n\n#### Pipe Connection Failures\n- Failed to connect crude oil pipes between storage tank and refinery\n  - Clear old pipe connections completely before attempting new ones\n  - Verify path between entities is unobstructed\n  - Ensure both connection points are accessible\n\n#### Production Monitoring\n- Chemical plant showing FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE despite water connection\n  - Verify all required input fluids are connected and available\n  - Check recipe requirements match connected fluids\n  - Monitor fluid levels in input tanks\n\n#### General Tips\n- When placing large structures like storage tanks, check a wider area for valid positions\n- Verify fluid systems are properly connected end-to-end before expecting production\n- Monitor entity status indicators to detect connection issues early\n- Clear old connections completely before attempting new ones to avoid conflicts"}
