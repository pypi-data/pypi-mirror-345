{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection System\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) is mining coal and supplying it to a **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) is used to collect mined coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) moves items from a **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) stores items for the inserter to move.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0) is used for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (11.5, 0.5) moves items from a **Wooden Chest** at position (12.5, 0.5) to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (12.5, 0.5) stores items for the inserter to move.\n\n### Transport System\n- **BeltGroup** connects various positions, notably from (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and further to (6.5, 0.5), facilitating movement of items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- Verify the existence of entities before attempting to interact with them, such as using `get_entity` or `inspect_inventory` on non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect attribute access\n- Ensure that objects have the attributes you are trying to access. For example, `Position` objects do not have a `name` attribute.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of transport belts\n- Transport belts do not have an inventory to inspect. Avoid attempting to access inventory attributes on transport belts."}
