{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron ore mine at position(x=-17.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x=-17.0, y=-50.0) and transport belts at positions (x=-16.5 y=-51.5), (x=-15.5 y=-51.5)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x=-15.0, y=-50.0) and transport belts at positions (x=-14.5 y=-51.5), (x=-13.5 y=-51.5)\n-  Burner inserter (position x=-13.5, y=-50.5) that puts into transport belt at position (x=-13.5 y=-51.5)\n-  Burner inserter (position x=-13.5, y=-48.5) that puts into transport belt at position (x=-12.5 y=-48.5)\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(x=-10.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Furnace (position x=-10.0, y=-49.0) that smelts iron ore into iron plate\n-  Belt group that connects the furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-49.0) to the iron ore mine at position (x=-17.0, y=-50.0)\n\n### Storage at position(x=-16.5, y=-47.5)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Wooden chest (position x=-16.5, y=-47.5) that stores items\n-  Burner inserter (position x=-16.5, y=-46.5) that puts into wooden chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-47.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using incorrect prototype names\n-  Make sure to use the correct prototype name when getting an entity, for example, use 'Prototype' instead of 'Prototypena'\n### Errors when placing entities without fuel\n-  Ensure that entities that require fuel, such as burner mining drills and furnaces, have fuel before placing them\n### Errors when placing entities without a sink entity\n-  Ensure that entities that produce items, such as burner mining drills, have a sink entity, such as a transport belt or a chest, to accept the output\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   Important variables:\n    *   `wooden-chest`: type `Entity`, a wooden chest entity\n    *   `transport-belt`: type `Entity`, a transport belt entity\n    *   `burner-mining-drill`: type `Entity`, a burner mining drill entity\n    *   `stone-furnace`: type `Entity`, a stone furnace entity\n    *   `iron-ore`: type `Item`, an iron ore item\n    *   `iron-plate`: type `Item`, an iron plate item\n*   Utility functions:\n    *   `get_entity`: a function that gets an entity by its prototype name and position\n    *   `place_entity`: a function that places an entity at a given position\n    *   `get_inventory`: a function that gets the inventory of an entity\n    *   `insert_item`: a function that inserts an item into an entity's inventory\n    *   Failure modes:\n        +   `get_entity` may fail if the prototype name is incorrect\n        +   `place_entity` may fail if the entity requires fuel or a sink entity\n        +   `get_inventory` may fail if the entity does not have an inventory\n        +   `insert_item` may fail if the entity's inventory is full or the item is not compatible with the entity\n    *   Success modes:\n        +   `get_entity` returns the entity if the prototype name and position are correct\n        +   `place_entity` places the entity at the given position if the entity has fuel and a sink entity\n        +   `get_inventory` returns the entity's inventory if the entity has one\n        +   `insert_item` inserts the item into the entity's inventory if the entity's inventory is not full and the item is compatible with the entity"}
