{"content": "The error indicates that there is no `Electric Mining Drill` in your inventory, which is why you cannot place it. Let's address this by ensuring that you have the necessary components to craft or obtain an Electric Mining Drill.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Check Inventory for Electric Mining Drill:**\n   - Verify if you have the Electric Mining Drill in your inventory.\n\n2. **Craft or Obtain an Electric Mining Drill:**\n   - If you don't have one, you'll need to craft it or obtain it from another source.\n\n3. **Ensure Resources for Crafting:**\n   - Electric Mining Drills typically require iron plates, iron gear wheels, and electronic circuits. Ensure you have these components.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check if Electric Mining Drill is in inventory\nelectric_mining_drill_count = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.ElectricMiningDrill, 0)\n\n# Step 2: Craft Electric Mining Drill if not available\nif electric_mining_drill_count == 0:\n    # Check for necessary components\n    iron_plates = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\n    iron_gear_wheels = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0)\n    electronic_circuits = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit, 0)\n\n    # Ensure enough resources are available\n    if iron_plates < 10 or iron_gear_wheels < 5 or electronic_circuits < 3:\n        print(\"Not enough resources to craft Electric Mining Drill.
