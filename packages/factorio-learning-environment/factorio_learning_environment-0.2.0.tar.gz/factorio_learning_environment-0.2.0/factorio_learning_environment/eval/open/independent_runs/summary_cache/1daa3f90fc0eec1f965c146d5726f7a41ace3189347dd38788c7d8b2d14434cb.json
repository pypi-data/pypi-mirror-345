{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Area at position(-11.5, 19.5)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n- First stone furnace at position(-11.0, 20.0)\n- Second stone furnace at position(-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational with coal as fuel but currently idle due to lack of input materials.\n\n###Coal Mining Complex at position(20.0, -15.0)\nA series of coal mining setups consisting of:\n- First setup: Burner mining drill at (20.0, -15.0) with burner inserter at (20.5, -13.5)\n- Second setup: Burner mining drill at (22.0, -15.0) with burner inserter at (23.5, -14.5)\n- Third setup: Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0) with burner inserter at (25.5, -14.5)\nThe third setup is fully fueled and operational, while the status of others is uncertain.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify you have the required items in your inventory\n- Harvest or craft necessary items before attempting insertion operations\n\n### Errors related to entity output blockage\n- Ensure there is a proper destination entity or space for the output of mining drills and inserters\n- Set up proper item collection systems (like chests or belts) at entity output positions\n- Clear any items blocking the output tile before expecting the entity to operate\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft items requiring assembly machines\n- Iron gear wheels cannot be crafted by hand as they require assembly machines\n- Before attempting to craft items like iron gear wheels, ensure you:\n  1. Have the required assembly machine built\n  2. Have the necessary raw materials (iron plates) available\n  3. Use the assembly machine for crafting instead of trying to craft manually\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Verify that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it\n- Craft or obtain the entity first before trying to place it\n\n### Errors when crafting technology-locked items\n- Assembling machines require the \"Automation\" technology to be researched before they can be crafted\n- Check technology prerequisites before attempting to craft advanced items\n- Research required technologies first, then proceed with crafting\n\n### Errors when crafting items requiring furnace processing\n- Copper plates cannot be crafted by hand as they require smelting in a furnace\n- When crafting items that need copper plates (like automation science packs):\n  1. Set up a furnace\n  2. Process copper ore into copper plates first\n  3. Then use the copper plates for further crafting\n\n### Errors when crafting items requiring raw resources\n- Some items like stone furnaces require raw resources (stone) that must be mined\n- Cannot craft raw resources - they must be gathered from the environment\n- Before crafting items requiring raw resources:\n  1. Locate the required resource on the map\n  2. Set up mining operations to gather it\n  3. Then proceed with crafting\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Ensure the entities you're trying to connect are compatible with belt connections\n- Verify that the positions for belt placement are valid and unoccupied\n- Check that the belt placement follows a valid path between the source and destination entities\n\n### Errors related to entity fuel\n- Always ensure mining drills and inserters have fuel before expecting them to operate\n- Add fuel to entities immediately after placing them\n- Monitor fuel levels to prevent operation interruptions"}
