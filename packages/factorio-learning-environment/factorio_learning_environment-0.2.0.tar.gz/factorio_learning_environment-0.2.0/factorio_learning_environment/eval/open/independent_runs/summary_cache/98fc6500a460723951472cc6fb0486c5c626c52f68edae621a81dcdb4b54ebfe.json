{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Repeated attempts to craft and position a Lab at (0.5, 2.5)\u2014which is intended to supply Automation Science Packs for research\u2014were unsuccessful. Although the process referenced existing processing facilities (a furnace at (5.0, 5.0) for iron conversion and a furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper conversion), no new structure has been constructed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, ensure that only the parameters accepted by its signature are used. Avoid including unsupported keywords (such as \u2018radius\u2019) or passing an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that a Lab item is available in the inventory before attempting to place it at (0.5, 2.5).\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all sub-ingredients required for Lab production (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are sufficiently available.\n\u2003\u2013 Prevent errors when processing retrieved entities by using proper fallback logic (e.g., converting a None return into an empty list).\n\n\u2022 Resource Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that resource conversion processes have adequate inputs (such as ore, fuel, and intermediary products) so that dependent recipes\u2014like Lab crafting\u2014can be supported without shortages."}
