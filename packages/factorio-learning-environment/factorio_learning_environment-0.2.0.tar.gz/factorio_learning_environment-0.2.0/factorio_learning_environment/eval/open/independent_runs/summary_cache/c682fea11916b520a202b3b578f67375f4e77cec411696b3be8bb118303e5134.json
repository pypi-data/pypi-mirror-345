If an existing object is in the way, the pole cannot be placed.\n\n### Errors when trying to connect to the electric network\n- Check that small electric poles are properly placed and not overlapping with other entities. Ensure that the lab is within the range of the electric poles for power connection.\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Keep track of the number of small electric poles in inventory. If you attempt to place a pole when none are available, it will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of entities\n- Avoid trying to access attributes that do not exist for certain entity types, such as energy attributes for electricity groups. Always verify the available attributes for the specific entity type before accessing them."}
