{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position (42.0, -81.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** (position: 42.0, -81.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n#### Wooden Chest at position (44.5, -80.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** (position: 44.5, -80.5): Used for storing iron plates. Currently contains 59 iron plates.\n\n#### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** (position: 43.5, -80.5): Used to transfer items between the stone furnace and the wooden chest. It is fueled by coal and is currently waiting for source items.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert items without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces. For example:\n  - **Iron Ore**: Required for smelting in the furnace.\n  - **Coal**: Required as fuel for the furnace and burner inserter.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities without the required items\n- Ensure the entity contains the items you want to extract before attempting to extract them. For example:\n  - **Furnace**: Ensure it contains iron plates before attempting to extract them.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure you have all necessary sub-ingredients before attempting to craft items. For example:\n  - **Iron Gear Wheel**: Requires iron plates, which must be smelted in a furnace.\n\n#### Errors when moving to a position with incorrect attributes\n- Ensure the position object has the correct attributes (e.g., `x` and `y`) before attempting to move to it. For example:\n  - Use a valid position object when calling `move_to`.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before attempting to place an entity. For example:\n  - Check for existing entities at the target position before placing a new one.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items without being near the target entity\n- Ensure you are near the target entity (e.g., furnace) before attempting to extract items from it.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items without a crafting machine or furnace\n- Ensure you have the necessary crafting machine or furnace to craft items. For example:\n  - **Iron Plate**: Requires smelting in a furnace.\n  - **Iron Gear Wheel**: Requires an assembling machine or similar crafting entity."}
