Additionally, it appears that I do not have any iron ore available to insert into the new furnace, which is preventing further operations.\n\n### Current Situation:\n1. The furnace is in an `EntityStatus.NO_FUEL` state, meaning it cannot operate without fuel.\n2. My inventory shows that I have 66 iron plates but no iron ore, which is necessary for smelting.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Gather Iron Ore**: I need to move to the nearest iron ore patch to gather more iron ore.\n2. **Collect Coal**: If I have not gathered enough coal, I should also check for coal while I\u2019m at it.\n3. **Reinsert Resources**: After gathering the necessary resources, I will return to the furnace and insert both coal and iron ore to resume operations.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Step 1: Move to the nearest iron ore resource to gather more ore.\niron_ore_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_ore_position)\n\n# Step 2: Harvest additional iron ore to restock.\nharvest_resource(iron_ore_position, quantity=10)  # Gather a sufficient quantity of iron ore\n\n# Step 3: Check the inventory after harvesting iron ore.\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory after harvesting iron ore: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Step 4: Move to the nearest coal patch to gather more coal if necessary.\ncoal_position = nearest(Resource.Coal)\nmove_to(coal_position)\n\n# Step 5: Harvest additional coal to ensure I have enough for smelting.\nharvest_resource(coal_position, quantity=10)  # Gather around 10 more coal\n\n# Step 6: Check the inventory after harvesting coal.\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory after harvesting coal: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Step 7: Now insert the harvested coal and iron ore into the furnace for continued smelting.\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=current_inventory[Prototype.Coal])  # Insert all harvested coal\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, new_furnace, quantity=current_inventory[Prototype.IronOre])  # Insert all harvested iron ore\n\n# Step 8: Verify the furnace inventory after the resource insertion.\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory after inserting resources: {inspect_inventory(new_furnace)}\")\n\n# Step 9: Allow time for the smelting process again and check for new iron plates.\nfor _ in range(30):  # Maximum 30 seconds wait for iron plates to be produced.\n    if inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 5:  # Check if we produce enough plates\n        break\n    sleep(1)\n\n# Final inventory check after smelting.\nfinal_inventory_after_smelting = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final Inventory after smelting: {final_inventory_after_smelting}\")", "summary_range": "[1-62]"}
