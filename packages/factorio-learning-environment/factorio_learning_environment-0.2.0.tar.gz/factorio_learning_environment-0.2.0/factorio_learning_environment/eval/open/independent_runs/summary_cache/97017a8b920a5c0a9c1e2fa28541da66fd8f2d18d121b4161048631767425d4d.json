{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Furnace at position (4.0, -60.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (4.0, -60.0): Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently contains 33 iron ore and 12 iron plates in progress.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, the agent tried to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory.\n\n#### Errors during smelting due to insufficient fuel or inputs\n- Always check that the furnace has enough fuel and input materials before starting the smelting process. The agent repeatedly encountered smelting timeouts due to insufficient coal or iron ore.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Verify that the entity contains the items you are trying to extract before attempting extraction. The agent repeatedly tried to extract iron plates from the furnace when it did not have enough plates ready.\n\n#### Errors when asserting inventory quantities\n- Double-check inventory quantities before performing actions that depend on specific item counts. The agent attempted to assert it had 11 iron plates in inventory but only had 7.\n\n#### Errors when using incorrect API parameters\n- Ensure the correct parameters are passed to API functions. The agent tried to extract items using an incorrect entity reference, leading to repeated errors. Always use the correct entity object or position when interacting with entities.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has enough space before inserting items. The agent repeatedly tried to insert coal and iron ore into a furnace that was already full, leading to errors. Regularly extract finished products to free up space.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace or other entity. The agent tried to insert iron ore and coal into the furnace without having enough in its inventory.\n\n#### Errors due to smelting timeouts\n- Monitor the smelting process and ensure that the furnace has a continuous supply of fuel and input materials. The agent repeatedly encountered smelting timeouts, indicating inefficiencies in the supply chain. Consider automating the supply of coal and iron ore to the furnace to avoid interruptions.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a furnace with no available output\n- Ensure that the furnace has finished smelting and has output items available before attempting extraction. The agent tried to extract iron plates when none were ready, leading to errors. Wait for the smelting process to complete before extracting items."}
