Always validate grid alignment and clear surrounding obstructions before confirming a candidate placement.\n\u2003\u2013 When using placement helpers (such as placing an entity adjacent to a reference), ensure the target tile is truly empty; in one case a burner-inserter\u2019s presence led to placement failure.\n\n\u2022 Belt Connection & Path Normalization Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to connect transport belts directly to a Prototype.WoodenChest target (or via an intermediary that is unprepared) resulted in errors. Use an inserter as the connection endpoint instead.\n\u2003\u2013 Several belt connection attempts failed due to path normalization errors; verify endpoints and all waypoints are grid-aligned and fall into buildable areas.\n\n\u2022 Output Blockage and Obstruction Management:\n\u2003\u2013 The mining drill output remains blocked because no proper sink entity has been established. Ensure that any obstructing transport belt is cleared and that the connection chain correctly leads via an inserter.\n\u2003\u2013 When repositioning or connecting, factor in both proximity and buildability to avoid \u201ctoo far\u201d or \u201coccupied tile\u201d issues.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 shift_entity_local(entity: Entity, offset: Tuple[float, float]) -> Entity  \n\u2003\u2013 Shifts the given entity\u2019s position by the specified offset.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Success: Entity is repositioned correctly.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Failure: Prototype mismatches may occur if identifier strings are not standardized.\n\n\u2022 nearest_buildable(position: Position) -> BoundingBox  \n\u2003\u2013 Determines the nearest buildable area surrounding a given position for entity placement.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Success: Returns a valid bounding box for placement.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Failure: Misuse of property access (e.g., treating candidate_box.center as callable) can trigger errors.\n\n\u2022 place_entity_next_to(prototype: Prototype, reference_position: Position, direction: Direction, spacing: int) -> Optional[Entity]  \n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place an entity of the given prototype adjacent to a reference position according to the specified direction and spacing.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Success: Returns the placed entity if the target cell is buildable and unoccupied.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Failure: Returns an error if the target position is occupied (as by an existing burner-inserter) or otherwise invalid.\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 furnace_input_chest_pos (Position) \u2013 Holds the position of the furnace input chest.\n\u2022 current_player_inventory (Inventory) \u2013 Tracks the current state of the player\u2019s inventory.\n\u2022 mining_drill_drop (Position) \u2013 Stores the mining drill\u2019s output drop position (e.g., (-14.5, -48.5)).\n\u2022 target_chest_position (Position) \u2013 Represents the position of the attempted connection target for transport belts (e.g., (-10.5, -48.5))."}
