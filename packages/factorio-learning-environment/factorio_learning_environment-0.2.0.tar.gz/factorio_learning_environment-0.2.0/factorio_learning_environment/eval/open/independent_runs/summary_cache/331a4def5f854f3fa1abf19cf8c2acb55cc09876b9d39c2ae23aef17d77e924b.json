{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) converting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) currently fueled with coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into a full chest**\n  - The warning indicates that the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) is full. To avoid this, ensure to regularly empty the chest or increase its capacity before inserting more items.\n\n- **Errors when extracting from a chest**\n  - Ensure that the extraction is performed when there are sufficient items in the chest to avoid unnecessary operations.\n\n- **Errors when using the burner mining drill**\n  - Ensure that the burner mining drill has enough fuel to operate continuously. Regularly check and replenish coal as needed.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None invoked.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `iron_ore_count: int` - Total count of iron ore extracted and stored.\n  - `coal_count: int` - Total count of coal used in the burner mining drill.\n  - `iron_plate_count: int` - Total count of iron plates produced in the stone furnace."}
