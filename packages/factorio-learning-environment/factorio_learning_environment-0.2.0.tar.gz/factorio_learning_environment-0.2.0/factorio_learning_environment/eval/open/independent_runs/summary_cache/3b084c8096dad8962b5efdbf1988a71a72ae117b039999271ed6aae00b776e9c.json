{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Smelting Setup at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- First furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Second furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal as fuel (23 each) and contain 11 iron plates in result slot, but currently have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n###Copper and Iron Mining/Smelting Setup with Collection System at position(-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- First burner mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0), rotated downward, fueled with 22 coal\n- Second burner mining drill at position (-26.0, -61.0), rotated downward, fueled with 12 coal\n- First furnace at position (-27.0, -59.0), fueled with 18 coal, containing 13 copper plates and 3 iron ore\n- Second furnace at position (-25.0, -59.0), fueled with 18 coal, containing 17 iron plates\n- Collection system for copper furnace:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-26.5, -56.5), fueled with 14 coal\n  - Wooden chest at position (-26.5, -55.5)\n- Collection system for iron furnace:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-24.5, -56.5), fueled with 13 coal\n  - Wooden chest at position (-24.5, -55.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when trying to place entities in already occupied positions\n- Before placing furnaces or other entities, verify the target position is completely free\n- Check if any entity's working area or drop position overlaps with the intended placement location\n- Consider the full tile dimensions of both existing and new entities when planning placement\n\n### Errors when trying to place inserters in invalid positions\n- When placing inserters next to mining drills, ensure the position doesn't conflict with the drill's drop position\n- Consider the tile dimensions and working area of existing entities before placing inserters\n- For mining drills, the drop position is a critical operational point and cannot be blocked by other entities\n- When placing inserters, ensure there's enough clearance from other entities' working areas\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces or drills, try increasing the spacing parameter if initial placement fails\n\n### Errors related to entity spacing and direction\n- When using place_entity_next_to, carefully consider the spacing parameter\n- If placement fails, try increasing the spacing value\n- Consider alternative directions when the desired placement direction is blocked\n- Verify that the reference position and direction combination will result in a valid placement\n\n### Errors when trying to pick up non-existent entities\n- Verify the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up\n- Double check coordinates when attempting to pick up entities\n- Keep track of entity positions in your data structures to ensure accuracy\n\n### Errors related to blocked output\n- Mining drills become blocked when their output location is full\n- Place appropriate storage or transport systems (like chests or belts) at the drop positions\n- Ensure there's a way to remove processed items from furnaces to prevent output blockage\n- When using inserters, ensure their drop position has available space\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from player position\n- Maximum placement distance is 10 units from player position\n- Move closer to the target location before attempting to place entities\n- Calculate distance between current position and target position before placement\n\n### Errors related to entity fuel status\n- Remember to fuel burner mining drills after placement\n- Add fuel (coal) to burner mining drills before expecting them to operate\n- Verify you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert fuel into entities\n\n### Errors related to inserter operation\n- Ensure inserters have fuel before expecting them to operate\n- Keep track of coal in inventory before attempting to fuel inserters\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels to prevent operation interruption\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended source and destination entities"}
