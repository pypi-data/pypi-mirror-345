{"content": "The repeated message indicating that the **Burner Inserter** is not found on the map suggests that there might be an issue with how the entities are being queried or that the **Burner Inserter** may not be in a state that allows it to be identified as operational.\n\n### Analysis of the Situation\n1. **Entity Retrieval**: The method used to retrieve the **Burner Inserter** may not be functioning correctly. It could be that the **Burner Inserter** is either not placed on the map or is in a state that prevents it from being recognized by the API.\n2. **Operational Status**: The **Burner Inserter** might be present but not in an operational state, leading to it being excluded from the search results.\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Issue\n1. **List All Entities**: Instead of filtering for operational **Burner Inserters**, I will list all **Burner Inserters** on the map to confirm their presence.\n2. **Check Their Status**: After listing, I will check their status to see if they are operational or not.\n3. **Insert Coal**: If any **Burner Inserters** are found, I will attempt to insert coal into one of them.\n\n### Revised Code\nLet's implement these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check current inventory\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Current Inventory:\", current_inventory)\n\n# Step 2: Retrieve all Burner Inserters on the map\nburner_inserters = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerInserter})\n\n# Step 3: Print out all found Burner Inserters and their statuses\nif burner_inserters:\n    for inserter in burner_inserters:\n        print(f\"Found Burner Inserter at {inserter.position} with status: {inserter.status}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Attempt to insert coal into the first found Burner Inserter\n    first_burner_inserter = burner_inserters[0]  # Use the first one found\n    if current_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) >= 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, first_burner_inserter, 5)  # Insert coal into the Burner Inserter\n        print(\"Inserted 5 coal into the Burner Inserter.\")\n        \n        # Step 5: Check the status of the Burner Inserter after the insertion attempt\n        burner_inserter_status = first_burner_inserter.status \n        print(\"Status of the Burner Inserter after refueling:\", burner_inserter_status)\n    else:\n        print(\"Not enough coal in inventory to insert into the Burner Inserter.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Burner Inserters found on the map.\")\n```\n\n### Expected Outcome\nThis code will:\n- List all **Burner Inserters** and their statuses.\n- Attempt to insert coal into the first **Burner Inserter** found, regardless of its operational status.\n- Print the status after the insertion attempt.\n\nBy following this approach, I can verify the presence of **Burner Inserters** and ensure that I am interacting with the correct entities.", "summary_range": "[1-2026]"}
