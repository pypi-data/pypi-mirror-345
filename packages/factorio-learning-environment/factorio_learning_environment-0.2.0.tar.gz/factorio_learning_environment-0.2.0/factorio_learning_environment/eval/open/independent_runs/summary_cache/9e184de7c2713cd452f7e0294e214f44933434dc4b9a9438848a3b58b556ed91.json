{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles for power distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n- Inserter at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5) for input\n- Inserter at Position (x=9.5, y=5.5) for output\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=5.5) for storage\n- Transport Belt Network connecting the furnace and inserters\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) for input\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are available before starting production processes. For example, the assembling machine cannot create copper cables due to missing copper plates.\n\n### Errors When Inserters Are Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the inserters have access to the required input items. Ensure that the source items are available in the connected chests or belts.\n\n### Errors When Furnaces Have No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Make sure that the furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials to smelt. Regularly check the input inventory of furnaces to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which Is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
