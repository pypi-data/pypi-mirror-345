Remove any existing entities that obstruct placement.\n\n### Errors due to entities being out of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of burner mining drills and inserters to ensure they are operational. Refuel them as necessary to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. Regularly empty chests or increase storage capacity to avoid bottlenecks."}
