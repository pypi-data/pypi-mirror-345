{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5) \n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 23.0) \n- Offshore pump at position(-7.5, 25.5) \n- Small electric poles at positions (-0.5, -11.5), (-1.5, -11.5), (1.5, -10.5), (1.5, -11.5), (-2.5, -8.5), (-2.5, -9.5), (1.5, -9.5)\n\n### Stone furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Stone furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Lab at position(5.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position(5.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to a power pole before attempting to use it. Verify the connection status after placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors related to entity status\n- Regularly check the status of entities (e.g., boilers, furnaces) to ensure they have the necessary inputs and are functioning correctly."}
